Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. Stevens, who was named the franchise\u2019s 17th head coach on July 3, 2013, has produced a 318-245 win-loss record (.565) in six-plus seasons with the Celtics. His 318 wins are the fourth-most by any Celtics coach in franchise history (795-Auerbach, 427-Heinsohn, 416-Rivers). \u201cBrad is an accomplished coach and an outstanding person,\u201d said Boston Celtics Lead Owner and Governor Wyc Grousbeck. \u201cWe are proud to have him lead our team forward in our quest for Banner 18.\u201d \u201cWe are thrilled that Brad Stevens will continue to be our coach,\u201d said Boston Celtics Co-Owner Steve Pagliuca. \u201cHe has become one of the best coaches in the NBA, and is a real leader on and off the court. This is a great day for the Boston Celtics.\u201d \u201cBrad is one of the most intelligent and hard-working coaches in the game today,\u201d said Boston Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge. \u201cMore importantly, his character and integrity have contributed to a culture that we all highly value here. Brad is a great teammate, and a leader people want to follow. We are honored to have him with us as we continue to pursue our next championship.\u201d With Stevens at the helm, the Celtics are poised for their sixth consecutive playoff appearance in 2019-20, marking the franchise\u2019s longest such streak since doing so from 2007-08 to 2012-13. Stevens helped guide the Celtics to back-to-back trips to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016-17 and 2017-18, marking the first time since the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons that the organization has reached the Conference Finals in consecutive seasons. Stevens, 43, has been named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month three times in his seven seasons with the Celtics, making him one of two coaches to earn three such honors with the franchise. The Zionsville, Indiana native also served as the head coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans, Louisiana, to become the seventh coach in franchise history to hold such a role (Auerbach, Fitch, Ford, Heinsohn, Jones, Rivers). Currently in his seventh campaign with the Celtics, Stevens has notched multiple milestones during the 2019-20 season. He became just the fifth coach in franchise history to reach the 300-win mark with a victory at Orlando on January 24, and surpassed K.C. Jones (308 wins) for the fourth-most wins on the franchise ledger with a victory at Minnesota on February 21."},{"id":26464,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-nbpa-coronavirus-test-results-official-release","date":"2020-08-12","title":"Latest NBA COVID-19 test results return zero positive tests","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Of the 342 players tested for COVID-19 on the NBA campus since test results were last announced on Aug. 5, zero have returned confirmed positive tests.

(AP) \u2014 NBA players could have some family members or close friends inside the season-restart bubble with them by the end of the month. And that raises the possibility of having a real, albeit small, cheering section for some playoff games. The league detailed the policies for guest arrivals to teams on Wednesday in a memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. The opportunity to bring guests into the bubble at Walt Disney World will be only for teams advancing to the second round of the playoffs, and the earliest any guest could satisfy quarantine rules and be reunited with a player is Aug. 31. In most cases, players would be limited to four guests. The league told teams that any guests would have to be either family members, \u201clongtime close personal friends with whom a player has an established, pre-existing, and known personal relationship,\u201d private security staff and established family childcare providers. Those who wouldn\u2019t be allowed into the bubble: \u201ctrainers, physical or massage therapists, personal chefs, hair\/apparel stylists, tattoo artists, and current\/prospective business partners, and certified agents (other than family members), among others,\u201d the memo said. Also not allowed, according to the league: casual acquaintances, friends by association, anyone the player has not previously met in person or is \u201cknown by the player only through social media or an intermediary.\u201d ESPN first reported on the contents of the memo. Players have made no secret about how difficult it is to be away from their families and close friends inside the bubble. Some players have needed to leave the bubble for family emergencies; others, such as Boston\u2019s Gordon Hayward, have said they will leave for the pending birth of children. Hayward and his wife are expecting their fourth child next month. \u201cI miss the hell out of my family,\u201d Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James said last week. \u201cMy wife, my kids, my mother, and so on, and so on. So, it\u2019s a huge challenge.\u201d The Phoenix Suns have had friends and family at games \u2014 in the form of a pregame video that introduces starters before the games that are classified as Suns\u2019 home contests. The video was trending Tuesday when the Suns released a copy on their social media channels, and many NBA players such as James and Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry raved about the gesture. \u201cWe say family a lot,\u201d Suns coach Monty Williams. \u201cIt was a surprise to all of us the first time we saw it, to see your families organize that kind of intro. It\u2019s unique.\u201d Exceptions to the four-person limit could apply in cases where the player has up to four of his minor children coming to the bubble. But in all cases, the same policies for others in the bubble \u2014 such as adhering to strict standards before traveling to the Orlando area, then quarantining before being allowed to enter the campus, plus submitting to daily testing and mandatory wearing of face coverings \u2014 would apply to guests as well. Guests would also have to remain in the bubble, meaning the adjacent Disney World theme parks would be off-limits. The league said programming and entertainment for kids would be available, such as games, swimming pools and bicycles. Players would also get one ticket authorizing entry for one adult to each of that team\u2019s playoff games after guest arrivals, so basically for the second round and beyond. That ticket would also allow an adult to bring a child \u2014 provided the child is 2-foot-8 or shorter \u2014 to those games as well, if \u201cthe child remains seated with \u2026 the adult to whom the ticket was issued, maintains at least six feet of distance from any other individual, and wears a face covering.\u201d That would be the first opportunity for players to hear actual cheers from people inside a game arena since the season shut down on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Games during the restart have had a fan presence, but only on 17-foot-high video boards that surround the game courts. The league said it would seek ways to add seating and potentially give players more than just the one ticket per game. Teams will also be allowed to add staff to the bubble, with a requirement being an on-campus person to serve as a liaison between the guests, teams and NBA league office."},{"id":26555,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/damian-lillard-61-rampage-restart","date":"2020-08-12","title":"Damian Lillard's rampage means it's 'Dame Time' for the NBA restart","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014  Damian Lillard is in here bursting bubbles belonging to the Memphis Grizzlies, Phoenix Suns, San Antonio Spurs, Pat Beverley, Paul George, the last two defensive schemes thrown his way and all his critics, both the real and (especially) the imagined. The world isn\u2019t against Dame, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s too fueled up to notice and besides, if this is what it takes to keep the Trail Blazers playing into next week, Portland is better off if he\u2019s all up in his own feelings. Still smarting from days ago when his two missed free throws cost Portland a win against the LA Clippers, and the spicy social media fallout that followed, Lillard is on a mini-redemption tour that doesn\u2019t go anywhere but Orlando, site of the NBA reboot. Well, check that: Lillard and the Blazers will head to the NBA playoffs if this and his anger keeps up. \u201cHe\u2019s come out focused and determined,\u201d said Blazers coach Terry Stotts. \u201cNo one felt worse about those free throws than he did. Nobody wanted to come into this bubble wanting to go the playoffs more than Dame.\u201d On Tuesday, Lillard chopped up the Mavericks with a career- and franchise-high-tying 61 points \u2014 making all 18 of his free throws, by the way \u2014 and this was on the heels of his 51-pointer in a win over the Sixers. \u201cI told you when I first came here\u201d Lillard said postgame, to TNT sideline reporter Chris Haynes. \u201cI said, \u2018I ain\u2019t coming here to waste my time.\u2019 They gave us a chance to get in like we asked for, and that\u2019s what we here to do. Job still ain\u2019t done, but you know what I\u2019m here for. Our work ain\u2019t done yet, but we\u2019re fighting for it.\u201d Against Dallas, Lillard shot 17-for-32 from the field, including 9-of-17 from 3-point range, adding five rebounds and eight assists. During a stoppage of play in the closing moments, flush with his own heroics, Lillard looked to the side and yelled: \u201cPut some respect on my name!\u201d The comment, peppered with an F-word, was evidently directed toward TV and the internet since no fans were in the building. Yet there were a small gathering of reporters, none known as Lillard critics, caught in the crossfire. \u201cIt was just a bunch of people on the opposite side, that press row area,\u201d said Lillard. \u201cThose are the people who have something to say or put out whatever they put out.\u201d That wasn\u2019t an accidental outburst. Throughout his career, which is destined to finish in Springfield one day, Lillard has wrestled with respect, which he feels has been thrown in his direction with teaspoons. He is prideful and professional, adored by his teammates, revered in Portland for his loyalty and humanitarian work; he will earn well north of $300 million before he\u2019s done playing; all are symbols of \u201crespect\u201d by most definitions. Lillard is also wrapping up perhaps his finest season, averaging 29.8 points per game for an injury-ravaged team and surely garnering some Kia MVP votes. Tuesday\u2019s effort was Lillard\u2019s third 60-point game of the season \u2014 placing him alongside Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to achieve that feat, though Wilt had seasons of nine (in 1962-63) and 15 (in \u201961-62). This also marked Lillard\u2019s sixth game of 50-plus this season and the 11th of his career, matching Allen Iverson for eight on the league\u2019s all-time leaderboard. Lillard now holds the four highest-scoring performances in Blazers history. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be on that type of company,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cI\u2019m also happy that two of the three came in a winning effort. Hopefully it can continue.\u201d But just as Chamberlain once lamented how \u201cnobody loves Goliath\u201d when he played and lost the tug-of-war of respect to Bill Russell, Lillard knows the feeling. Lillard has reached the Western Conference finals once, and that was last season, when the Blazers were swept by a Warriors team without Kevin Durant. Lillard shot poorly in the fourth quarters of those four games, yet without his dramatic jumper and puppet wave from nearly mid-court that finished off Oklahoma City in the first round, the Blazers might not have made it that far. The player who guarded him in vain on that basket was George, then with OKC, who later remarked how it \u201cwasn\u2019t a good shot,\u201d which of course Lillard took as a sign of disrespect. That\u2019s why Lillard became unhinged when George and Beverley mocked him for those missed free throws against the Clippers. When Lillard later mentioned how he \u201csent them home\u201d in the past with buzzer-beating playoff shots, that began a chain reaction of social media sparring between Lillard and those Clipper teammates, and later with Lillard and a notably bombastic national media member. That placed Lillard\u2019s biggest, if only, flaw directly in the spotlight: He\u2019s far too sensitive, especially for a four-time All-NBA team member; one critic to him sounds like one million. Again, it\u2019s understandable. Playing in a small media market on the West Coast for his entire career, without deep runs in the playoffs, Lillard doesn\u2019t feel the warmth of universal acceptance and that\u2019s perhaps unfair to an extent. And yet, after the last few days, the warmth has been rapidly increasing to scorching levels. With the Blazers logging two losses in the seeded portion of the schedule and unable to afford a third without grave consequences, Lillard has carried the club after those missed free throws. The Dallas game was close, with the Mavericks choosing to give their two stars, Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, heavy minutes despite having clinched a playoff spot. Lillard refused to allow the Blazers to wilt, and for much of the fourth quarter kept the ball in his hands. He was mostly good and a bit fortunate: One 3-pointer hit the back rim, soared 15 feet, then dropped through . Lillard also drew an offensive foul in the closing seconds to clinch the win. It was that kind of night \u2014 for the second straight game. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to stop him.\u201d The back-to-back eruptions loom as the best individual performance of the NBA reboot, and even better for the Blazers, it elevated them into the eighth and final playoff spot over the Grizzlies by mere percentage points \u2026 which will ultimately decide the order because the teams haven\u2019t played an equal number of games. The Blazers haven\u2019t clinched a playoff spot, but do control their destiny with one game remaining, Thursday against the Nets ( 9 ET, TNT ), with the Grizzlies, Suns and Spurs hot in pursuit. Only two will qualify for Saturday\u2019s Western Conference Play-In. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important game of our lives,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe control our own destiny and we know what we gotta do.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Being stuck in our homes and limiting our contact with outside services deemed non-essential tends to create a shared and somewhat frustrating experience. Let\u2019s get to the root of the subject. What I\u2019m talking about is hair, and how it became a follicle fallacy for most of us over the last four months \u2026 and how the NBA addressed this very important issue here at the Walt Disney World campus. Thankfully, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and his elves, during their intense and very expansive planning sessions for the season reboot, evidently placed this item on the agenda right next to testing, security, safety and the staging of games. No doubt, someone raised their hand at this meeting and asked: \u201cHow can people get their hair done?\u201d And then, you can imagine every head at the conference table began to nod, pencils were sharpened and notes were taken as the compassionate NBA commissioner pounded his fist and bellowed: \u201cLet\u2019s make this a priority.\u201d Or something like that. Anyway, the league had the foresight to squash an uprising by employing multiple barbers and stylists to offer their hair services over three-plus months at the season restart. All 340-plus players here have access to barbers. The women on staff can get their hair styled. And this perk has filtered down to the media \u2014 which as you know are never held in high esteem \u2014 yet in this instance someone at the league office was sympathetic. Players get free haircuts, but media fork over roughly the equivalent of a mortgage payment (or so I\u2019ve heard). I wouldn\u2019t know because I packed my own clippers. I\u2019ve been cutting my hair for years, ever since Father Time began making that choice easier; men of a certain age know what I\u2019m talking about. I believe Charles Barkley says: \u201cCome on home,\u201d which in translation means don\u2019t fight hair loss and just cut it close to the scalp. I\u2019ve cut my hair three times so far, using the strokes perfected from years of practice, and somewhere there\u2019s a barber cursing people like me. Just a guesstimate, but I figure I\u2019ve saved several thousands of dollars by skipping the barber. The only regret is I\u2019ve missed out on those engaging barbershop conversations, which are considered therapy and part of the price you pay at the shop. Ice Cube made movies about those talks, and LeBron James (who needs to come on home by the way) even created a recurring TV show on that. But what\u2019s disturbing here at Disney is how grown men are turning down the chance at a free cut. I tell them I have clippers, and they backpedal. It\u2019s such a confusing reaction. Marc Spears, the fine writer from The Undefeated, had the look of fright when I offered a free cut. Same for Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe . Folks are so peculiar and picky when it comes to their hair. Even people on expense accounts simply refuse to look for bargains. Maybe my skills aren\u2019t what they seem? Or if the option is going to a professional barber, they choose that? It\u2019s so insulting. Whatever. My supervisor Steve Quintana will be thrilled to know how much I\u2019ve saved the company with my DIY choice. Although I suppose that joy might be suppressed immediately if I ever offered to cut his hair. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Is the bubble down in Walt Disney World big enough for both Jimmy Butler and T.J. Warren? When Butler and Warren first tangled in January \u2014 with some rather unseemly extracurriculars in the third quarter of the Miami-Indiana game \u2014 the scheduled rematch was months away (March 20 and then again on April 7). Due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, the two combatants and their teams finally are meeting seven months after their initial histrionics. The Pacers face the Heat Monday night at the VISA Athletic Center on the Walt Disney Resort campus ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) and again on Friday (time and location TBD). If it feels as if the sports world got Ali-Frazier II more swiftly than we\u2019ve gotten the Butler-Warren rematch, that\u2019s one more thing to blame on the pandemic. For his part, Warren sounds as if he moved on from the sideshow back in the winter. \u201cI have no \u2026 for me, I don\u2019t really get into the back-and-forth,\u201d he told NBA.com Sunday. \u201cOnce I leave the court, it\u2019s over with me. But on the court, I\u2019m gonna compete in all ways. \u201cBasketball is basketball. That\u2019s nothing new, guys getting into it, going back and forth. That\u2019s part of the game.\u201d For those who do not recall the skirmish, Warren was guarding Butler in the third quarter as Miami led 79-56. When Butler drove past him toward the hoop, Warren grabbed the Miami player\u2019s left arm and spun him around. Butler took umbrage, balling up his fists, and the two bumped chests and heads. Tweeeeet ! Double technicals. Of course it didn\u2019t end there. When play resumed, Butler got the ball, posted up Warren, then drove a shoulder into him, knocking Warren backwards. Butler knew he had earned the offensive foul \u2014 he immediately flipped the ball behind him to the baseline as he walked downcourt. But Warren trailed right behind, clapping his hands behind Butler\u2019s head. Tweeeeet ! Second tech on Warren and he was ejected. From there, it was WWE. Nasty words from 30 or 40 feet apart. Butler pantomiming kisses in Warren\u2019s direction, then Warren flipping an upraised finger back before he exited. Warren got fined $25,000 by the NBA for his part, including the obscene gesture. Butler got whacked $35,000 for taking to social media to keep the bad blood flowing. The NBA has a history of individual feuds, many of them the result of defensive assignments gone physical or, before or after game, gone verbal. Now, add gone social media. We\u2019re not talking about mere rivalries, mind you. Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird was too elite and too classy, as much as each burned to beat the other. Wilt Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell was entirely competition, with an occasional wink between the good friends off the court. Based on the first bout, this Butler-Warren thing features more friction, chafing and more actual disdain. That makes it more like Michael Jordan vs. Isiah Thomas. Dennis Rodman vs. Bird or Karl Malone. Bill Laimbeer vs. the Celtics\u2019 frontline during his career. Kevin Garnett vs. Tim Duncan was a Cold War on hardwood whenever they went head-to-head, Garnett glowering and grinding his molars while Duncan usually looked offended by that level of bile. Gary Payton seemed to take personally John Stockton\u2019s excellence when the two Hall of Famers met. Hakeem Olajuwon worked up a big case of dislike for David Robinson after Robinson beat him out in 1995 MVP voting, and dominated the Spurs center in the \u201995 West finals. Kobe Bryant had to dismiss a series of alleged and sometimes self-proclaimed \u201cKobe-stoppers,\u201d including Raja Bell, Bruce Bowen, Matt Barnes and Ruben Patterson. Of Bell, who spoke loudly to the media of their battles, Bryant famously said: \u201cI don\u2019t know this guy. I might have said one word to this guy. I don\u2019t know this kid.\u201d More recently, we\u2019ve had LeBron James vs. DeShawn Stevenson and LeBron vs. Lance Stephenson. Russell Westbrook vs. Patrick Beverley. In the last few days, Beverley and Paul George vs. Damian Lillard . And now, potentially playing out twice in five days, Butler vs. Warren. Both players, coincidentally, have been bothered lately by sore right feet. Butler is expected to play Monday after missing three games. Warren has pushed through his injury, averaging 38 minutes in the Pacers\u2019 4-1 restart. Bigger than that, of course, he has arguably been the \u201cbubble MVP\u201d with some eye-popping performances. The sixth-year forward from NC State has averaged 34.8 points, including his 53-point effort against Philadelphia on Aug. 1. He has averaged 6.6 rebounds, 2.4 asissts, 1.6 steals and 1.4 blocks in the restart while shooting 60.5% (and 55.6% on 3-pointers). Some of what Butler said after the game in Indy \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s not even in my league\u201d \u2014 no longer applies. Other comments \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s soft \u2026 he\u2019s trash \u2026 I can guard him, he can\u2019t guard me\u201d \u2014 might get adjudicated more fully this week. Butler wasn\u2019t made available to Miami media Sunday to discuss Warren or the looming games. But he has been known to thrive from tension and confrontations in his career, sometimes even with teammates in Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia.  Asked if that ever drove him, though, Warren told NBA.com: \u201cNot at all. You\u2019ll go crazy if you\u2019re trying to figure out why certain people feel the way they do about you. You can\u2019t be too concerned with other people\u2019s opinions. Only you know how much work you put into the game and how much you believe in yourself. As long as you have that, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d A little feistiness feeding into anticipation for team or individual matchups can be a good thing. Warren understands that sometimes pro sports these days come off as vast Millionaires Clubs, with more fraternity than hostility with opponents. \u201cDifferent guys handle different situations differently,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the fans and the media are gonna have fun with it. It\u2019s entertainment for them. But for me, I\u2019m just all basketball. I don\u2019t really feed into all that stuff.\u201d  At the very least, two games between Miami and Indiana might wind up setting up as many as seven more in the coming weeks. As a potential series between No. 4 and No. 5 in the East, there\u2019s a pre-playoff feel layered onto the Butler-Warren angle.  Warren doesn\u2019t know if coaches Nate McMillan or Erik Spoelstra plans to hold something back before the games really count. He\u2019s just eager for next week to get here. \u201cThis is going to be my first playoff, so I\u2019m really excited,\u201d he said. \u201cTo add the experience of being in the playoffs. I hear a lot of stories about how much preparation it takes, and how it\u2019s mentally and physically tougher. It\u2019s good to get advice \u2014 you can hear stories all the time \u2014 but until you really experience it, that\u2019s the big thing.\u201d Set the over\/unders soon for head-to-head points, fouls, technical, gestures and trash-talk word counts. This matchup has a chance to join some chippy NBA lore. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But even expecting the unexpected, we have to be surprised by the performances of some teams in Orlando. The title favorites have seemingly had a tough time adjusting. The Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers are a combined 7-10. The Lakers have had the worst offense in the restart , and the Bucks ranking 11th defensively over the last 11 days may be more shocking than that. Both Milwaukee and the Clippers lost to the Brooklyn Nets last week. The Phoenix Suns probably shouldn\u2019t have been invited to the restart. But they were, they have their first five-game winning streak in 5 1\/2 years, and they\u2019re still very much alive in the chase for eighth and ninth place in the Western Conference. The San Antonio Spurs went to Orlando to develop their young players and they\u2019ve found themselves in the middle of that same chase. Two playoff series in the East are set. The No. 1 seed Bucks will face the No. 8 seed Orlando Magic, while the No. 2 seed and defending-champion Toronto Raptors will face Brooklyn, the 7 seed. We also know that the Boston Celtics are the No. 3 seed in the East, while the Lakers are No. 1 in the West. Everything else will be determined in the next seven days, with the Western Conference play-in series taking place on Saturday and, if necessary, Sunday.

This happened last week when Devin Booker, the young star of the Suns, elevated for a jump shot while being distracted by the LA Clippers\u2019 ace defender, Paul George, just before time expired. As Booker released and fell to the floor while he watched the ball fall softly through the net, humans shown on the three video screens surrounding the court completely lost it. These were Suns fans, and they were inside the building at Disney\u2019s Wide World Of Sports both vivaciously and virtually. To put it simply, Booker and his Suns teammates didn\u2019t celebrate alone. The game wasn\u2019t won in Talking Stick Resort Arena, their normal home in Phoenix. It only felt that way when the buzzer sounded and the fans erupted. And that\u2019s the purpose behind the NBA\u2019s idea to use virtual fans at every restart game on the Disney campus. Without actual fans due to the coronavirus, the league created the next best optic: Invite fans to watch the game, in real time, through livestream and show their reactions inside the Disney arenas. The virtual fan experience has suddenly become a thing on social media. Not only are basketball-starved die-hards getting arena face time, the technology hasn\u2019t escaped the notice of famous faces who are angling for their close-up. Was that really Lil Wayne at the Lakers\u2019 game giving the fan \u201cnext\u201d to him a cyber hi-five? Somewhere in New York, Spike Lee, hard-core Knicks fan, might feel compelled to adopt a playoff team just this one time. The league collaborated with Microsoft on the technology, and partnered with Michelob Ultra to promote and roust the demand, although as the playoffs approach, getting fans into their virtual seats will be the least of the NBA\u2019s worries on this restart. Not only are the fans shown inside the arenas, but the national networks often cut away from the game to reveal who and what\u2019s on the video screens, which extend along each baseline and the sideline behind the team benches. The fans are selected multiple ways. They register on ultracourtside.com through Michelob and are also selected by each of the 22 participating teams, who favor their most loyal followers and also families of the players. It\u2019s a digital stay-at-home meeting, the only difference is basketball\u2019s version is a lot more exciting than your office\u2019s. \u201cWith the unfortunate situation involving the pandemic that we\u2019re in, we began to focus how to bring our fans closer to the game in different kinds of ways,\u201d said Sara Zuckert, the league\u2019s head of next generation telecasts. \u201cWe\u2019re in such a different scenario now, with the way everyone is consuming media and watching sports. We knew this would be something different. I don\u2019t think we could\u2019ve predicted the response. I\u2019m just thrilled to see how popular it is.\u201d  At each game, it\u2019s easy to tell the fans apart from the team attire which apparently is mandatory. Almost everyone\u2019s wearing a logo cap or T-shirt. Sometimes there are empty \u201cseats\u201d although that\u2019s misleading; the fan simply left view of the computer camera, either to answer the call of nature or fetch a refill on the bowl of chips. Also, with increasing frequency, seats are occupied by \u2026 pets. In that sense, the game has truly gone to the dogs; creative fans even share their seats with stuffed animals. \u201cThose are slightly surprising additions,\u201d said Zuckert. \u201cBeen very funny to see. We liked it.\u201d The lords of the project do police the audience to make sure the visuals and behavior are up to professional standards, and anyway, the NBA hasn\u2019t had issues. Folks are keeping it clean. \u201cWe\u2019ve had such great participation so far and we\u2019re optimistic about that continuing,\u201d Zuckert said. The most heartfelt fan sightings involve personal connections to the teams and players. It\u2019s common to see family members of the players, which is welcome because they\u2019ve been kept from the campus and the players have been here over a month now. Chris Paul\u2019s son was shown, same for the young sons of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jayson Tatum, which the Celtics forward said was \u201cpretty cool\u201d and was thrilled to see during timeouts. \u201cThat\u2019s a way to get families closer together with players since they can\u2019t be there,\u201d Zuckert said. Teams are also getting former players into the act. Bill Walton and Rasheed Wallace watched the Trail Blazers, Paul Pierce took in a Celtics game, Chris Bosh had a front-row seat for the Heat and Dirk Nowitzki was on hand for the Mavericks. Somehow, there was a Stephen Curry sighting even though his Warriors are at home. Curry\u2019s brother, Seth, does play for the Mavericks and besides, Steph\u2019s a gym rat. Even more remarkable is how, or why, Shaquille O\u2019Neal crashed a full day\u2019s worth of games and did so in his usual comical way. Teams are also reaching out to community groups to seek their involvement. One example was when the I Promise students appeared during a Lakers game to root for LeBron James, the player who created the Akron charter school. Also, the anthem singers are chosen from communities of that game\u2019s home team. There\u2019s room on the video boards for fans occupying 32 seats, with most awarded to the home team for that game. Whenever players from visiting team are at the free throw line, home fans behind the basket wave frantically as they normally would during normal times and do their best to distract. The goal is to make the atmosphere at the games as flavorful as technology can possibly allow.  The NBA has the advantage of being indoors, which separates its games from those in Major League Baseball parks. During this pandemic, MLB must settle for fan cutouts behind home plate and in the outfield. Those cutouts don\u2019t move any arms or legs unless there\u2019s a stiff breeze or a well-placed home run ball. The NFL will likely resort to the same \u2026 if there is a football season. The NBA\u2019s creative efforts didn\u2019t stop with virtual fans. The player introductions were pre-recorded by the regular team public-address announcers and the hype video is the same used all season. The on-site announcers will favor the home team by being more vocal for that team\u2019s baskets and plays than the visitors. The league also took suggestions from home teams to bring normalcy. The Thunder requested the piped-in crowd noise turned up to replicate the volume at Chesapeake Energy Arena in OKC. On the flip side, some teams want little to no music played while they have the ball for home games. With no real home-court advantage for teams with superior records, these are the concessions. It\u2019s all about providing the right visuals for TV, since these games minus fans are now being constructed and prepared for that medium only. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to having more fans, more names and expanding on this,\u201d Zuckert said. \u201cBeing able to have cheers and fans reacting is so much a part of our sport. There\u2019s really nothing we can do to replace being in an NBA arena, but we want to replicate as much as possible given the current situation. We understand the hurdles that many sports have during this time and we were focused on having as much real-time reaction as possible. We were all coming into this new scenario with so many things being different \u2014 camera angles, streams, and this was one more element we had to add.\u201d The virtual fan appeal should only grow when the playoffs start, and as it attracts more famous people, who are contacted by teams whenever they show interest in being part of the game. Devin Booker said he didn\u2019t notice fan reaction to his buzzer-beater \u2014 \u201cI was on the floor getting mobbed,\u201d he said \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t the only person whose view was blocked. Even before he released the shot, a number of Clippers fans in their digital seats were shown covering their eyes. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Once that takes place, they may have a key rotation player back in the mix. Forward Montrezl Harrell posted early Monday on Twitter that he is back on the NBA campus. He left the Walt Disney World campus on July 17 because of a personal matter. Per ESPN\u2019s Ohm Youngmiskuk, Harrell also posted a video on his Instagram account of the view outside his hotel window with the location of Disney Springs in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Clippers teammate Patrick Beverley, who also left the NBA campus for a period of time because of a family emergency, posted a heart emoji in response to Harrell\u2019s tweet.

It\u2019s called Shazam, not to be confused with the Shaquille O\u2019Neal movie, a name that\u2019s fitting because it\u2019s truly magical. With one press of a button, your cell phone \u201clistens\u201d to a song being played and within seconds will tell you the name and who made it and how to buy it. Which means, that anonymous song you hear on the radio or in the doctor\u2019s office or on the elevator can be yours in a snap. For me, Shazam is most useful at NBA games. That\u2019s where my playlist gets its nourishment, a steady diet of pregame music, hype music, player introduction music and timeout music. All that music is intertwined, a reflection of the culture that surrounds basketball and is endorsed by the players themselves. You want to know about the NBA? The arena music provides a hint.

It perfectly captures the rhythm and spirit of the game. However: Most of the music, for me, is hard to identify. Sometimes I get my hip-hoppers mixed up \u2014 Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert or Lil Baby? \u2014 and this would never happen years ago when I grew up on Bowie and Prince and the Isley Brothers. So Shazam is my savior, my No. 2 go-to device at games after my laptop, and with so many games here at Disney the Shazam is being put through a virtual workout. Based on what I\u2019ve gathered from the loudspeakers, here are the favorite and most requested artists at NBA arenas: Drake, of course, and not just because teams are here trying to win some Really Big Rings. Lil Baby. Most in demand of all the Lil\u2019s. Nipsey Hussle; RIP to the West Coast rapper who had sway among NBA players, some of whom wrote his name on their sneakers. Saweetie. She\u2019s the new it-lady, quickly gaining on Cardi B. Future. One of my personal favorites; his music gets so much playback he should record a song called Back To The Future. Also: Roddy Ricch, Gunna, Migos, Young Thug, Travis Scott, Meek Mill, Post Malone and a mostly unknown rapper named Sheck Wes who\u2019s especially popular here in Orlando for his biggest and only hit \u2014 a song he named \u201cMo Bamba\u201d after a certain Orlando Magic player. No other sport beats the NBA for music. The days of organists and rock bands are far gone. Curiously, the Magic in the late 1980s received complaints from traditional NBA types when, as an expansion team, they played loud music during the game. Nowadays, that\u2019s normal and expected and even demanded. When the Knicks experimented a few years ago without any music in a home game against the Warriors, players complained. It\u2019s all amplified by the player introduction music, which expanded in popularity after the Bulls used \u201cSirius\u201d by the Allan Parsons Project and \u201cRock and Roll Part 2\u201d by Gary Glitter at timeouts during the Michel Jordan championship years. The NBA even created a CD \u2014 remember those? \u2014 of the best in-game music. The evolution of NBA music has since shifted drastically in style and beat. It\u2019s all rap and hip-hop and R&B, and it\u2019s all mine. Thanks to the NBA and Shazam, selecting music has never been easier. I now got all the hits \u2014 the big and the Lil. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

After that game, Suns forward Mikal Bridges said dismally: \u201cI think you just go home, look yourself in the mirror and see if you really want this, if you really want to win and if you really want to contribute.\u201d A week after the NBA restart, the Suns are the only undefeated team in Orlando and find themselves in the playoff conversation. And so: After beating Miami to stay spotless at 5-0, guard Ricky Rubio said encouragingly: \u201cWe\u2019re hungry, thirsty and hoping to go 8-0.\u201d Well: What a difference a week makes, especially when that week stretches four months, no? It tells the tale of two Suns, one that was being eclipsed and the other beaming, and given a second chance, Phoenix is breathing new life in a most improbable situation. \u201cI think this bubble situation was made for us and we\u2019re taking advantage of it,\u201d said guard Devin Booker. Let\u2019s put this into context: This is the Suns\u2019 longest winning streak in six years, which says plenty about where the Suns have been and maybe where they\u2019re going. Obviously, this is the most consecutive wins in the career of Booker, at 23 the youngest player to score 7,000 points, who provided the biggest shot in Orlando with a buzzer-beater over the Clippers. Coming into this reboot at 26-39 and five games out of eighth place, the Suns had no shot of pulling out a playoff spot unless they either ran the table in the seeded schedule or came close. Well, both are in play; they\u2019re two games behind Memphis for eighth place and a half-game behind the Blazers for ninth and firmly in contention for a play-in game for the playoffs. Upcoming are remaining games with Oklahoma City, Philly and Dallas. Those three teams have already clinched playoff spots and might rest some of their starters against Phoenix; the Sixers will definitely be without Ben Simmons, who left the campus to undergo knee surgery. And yet it still won\u2019t be easy for the Suns; they\u2019ll need the Grizzlies, Blazers and Spurs to cooperate by losing a few games to raise the possibility of a Suns uprising. \u201c W e \u2019 re far from perfect,\u201d said coach Monty Williams. \u201cI\u2019m glad we have the record we have here in the bubble, but have a lot of work to do to overcome the obstacle in front of us.\u201d What exactly has gotten into the Suns? Along with the Wizards, they were mainly an afterthought in the restart as the teams with the worst records in the East and West. Washington has already faded as expected and simply playing out the schedule. The Suns refused to follow the script. With a young rotation and a coach in his first year in Phoenix, the Suns were on a rebuilding schedule \u2014 which seems constant in Phoenix \u2014 and in a best-case scenario would make a leap next season. And that was indeed the case when the season was halted by coronavirus. But there\u2019s been scant evidence of growth in restart wins over the Clippers, Wizards, Mavericks, Pacers and Heat. \u201cThese guys have had an offseason to think about the first 65 games and think about where they needed to grow,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the guys. They\u2019ve put in the work.\u201d They\u2019ll need to pick up the pace to escape their own history. A series of bungled front-office decisions put Phoenix on a constant and frustrating treadmill to nowhere, haunted mostly by wasted draft picks. They only have Booker, who\u2019s averaging 28 points, to show for constant trips to the draft lottery over the last decade. That includes taking Josh Jackson at four over point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox. Had the Suns taken Fox, he and Booker would\u2019ve been a young backcourt tandem for the future and Phoenix wouldn\u2019t have had to give away TJ Warren last summer to pay for Rubio. Warren is scorching for the Pacers right now and fresh off a 39-point game, just days after scoring 51. Because of that misery, the Suns are constantly battling perception problems, which lately caused Draymond Green, a new addition to the TNT broadcasting team, to demand the Suns reroute Booker to a contender, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for him, not good for his career.\u201d They also took Deandre Ayton ahead of Luka Doncic two years ago, and while Doncic is already an MVP contender and franchise player, Ayton\u2019s development continues. There\u2019s hope that Ayton will eventually be the front-line balance for Booker and becomes a big man who can be a presence around the rim, especially defensively. \u201cDeandre has bought into that during the three months we were out,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cHe has ability to be one of the best rim protectors but it\u2019s about the will, and he\u2019s showing he wants to. When he\u2019s showing that, we are at another level. He wants to do it and it shows.\u201d Williams agreed and added: \u201cDeandre\u2019s ability to put pressure on the rim is something we don\u2019t take for granted.\u201d A pair of other young players drafted by the Suns are also on the clock. Bridges and Cam Johnson are fluid swingmen who will require more time, yet Johnson in particular is making strides in Orlando. Against the Heat it was Jevon Carter who stepped forward with six three-pointers and 20 points, giving Booker plenty of help especially when left open. \u201cWe\u2019re showing positive energy all the time,\u201d said Carter. \u201cThey put us in this bubble and we knew we had a shot even if other people didn\u2019t. We\u2019re out to shock the world.\u201d Overall, the Suns collectively have shown more grit than they did right before the shutdown, and so far have managed to avoid any setback caused by the layoff. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be efficient by moving the ball around,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThis is how we like to play, with Ricky and Devin pushing the ball. But it starts with defense as well. We\u2019ve tried to defend every possession and we share the ball. It\u2019s a fun way to play but difficult to do. I think our guys enjoy it and we work at it.\u201d With nothing to lose and no burden on their shoulders, the Suns came to Orlando loose and pressure-free. That, along with the sudden confidence from a quick start, has the Suns imagining the possibilities. \u201cWe wanted to come here,\u201d said Williams, \u201cand make the most of it.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

What was clear was that George and the Clippers absolutely enjoyed Lillard\u2019s unlikely crunch-time cough-up with 18.6 seconds left and LA leading by one. The nationally televised broadcast showed Patrick Beverley and Marcus Morris gleefully celebrating, with Beverley audibly mocking Lillard\u2019s Dame D.O.L.L.A. nickname. George, meanwhile, offered the same parting wave that Lillard issued to him when he was a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder team that lost to Portland in the first round of the playoffs a year ago. George\u2019s postgame reaction in that instance included him insisting that Lillard\u2019s game-winning 37-footer was a \u201cbad shot\u201d despite the result. Saturday\u2019s loss reduces Portland\u2019s margin for error in the Western Conference race for the play-in tournament. The Blazers hold just a half-game lead over the Spurs, with the Suns also looming heading into their Saturday night tilt against Miami. Lillard, however, did not hesitate to address the Clippers\u2019 endgame antics following the loss. \u201cAsking me about Patrick Beverley, who I sent him home before at the end of a game,\u201d Lillard offered. \u201cPaul George is a guy sent home by me last year in the playoffs so they know. The reason they reacting like that is because of what they expecting from me, which is a sign of respect and it just shows what I have done at a high clip more times than not. I am not offended by it. \u201cIf anything, it should just tell you how much it hurt them to go through what I put them through in those situations previously.\u201d The pointed remarks didn\u2019t stop there. When Bleacher Report\u2019s Instagram account posted Lillard\u2019s postgame comments, George commented from his own account, \u201cAnd you getting sent home this year [crying laughing emoji] respect.\u201d Beverley also alluded to an assumed early exit for the Blazers, commenting, \u201cCancun on 3\u201d along with three more crying laughing emojis. Lillard answered their social media slights by mocking George\u2019s moves from Indiana to Oklahoma City and finally LA in a three-year span for a better chance to win an NBA championship. \u201cKeep switching teams \u2026 running from the grind,\u201d Lillard wrote. \u201cYou boys is chumps.\u201d Unfortunately for those desiring an on-court resolution to this confrontation, the Blazers can only qualify for the eighth seed, which would pit them against the top-seeded Lakers regardless of what happens in the remaining regular season games. Portland still has to qualify, however, a task made more urgent following Saturday\u2019s loss \u2014 and more bitter after the back-and-forth it produced."},{"id":26581,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ben-simmons-surgery-on-knee","date":"2020-08-08","title":"Ben Simmons to have surgery on left knee","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 All-Star Ben Simmons will have surgery on his left knee, a big blow for the Philadelphia 76ers and their hopes of making a deep run in this season\u2019s playoffs. The 76ers announced Saturday that Simmons will be leaving the NBA\u2019s season-restart bubble at Walt Disney World. There was no immediate timeframe for his return, and it\u2019s likely that no firm timetable on his recovery will be set until after the surgery. Simmons left Philadelphia\u2019s game against Washington on Wednesday midway through the third quarter because of injury, officially diagnosed as a subluxation of the left patella. A subluxation is a partial and temporary dislocation; the patella is the kneecap. Tests performed since revealed a loose body inside the knee, which led to the decision for surgery. \u201cAfter consultation with the 76ers medical staff and several specialists, Ben Simmons will undergo surgery in the coming days to remove a loose body in his left knee,\u201d the 76ers said on Saturday in a team release. \u201cThe loose body resulted from a left patella subluxation he suffered in Wednesday\u2019s game against Washington.\u201d Losing Simmons is the latest issue for a franchise that has endured many tough breaks in recent years on the injury front.

Brooklyn secured its trip by defeating Sacramento 119-106. Orlando\u2019s spot was clinched when Washington lost to New Orleans 118-107 later Friday, eliminating the Wizards from contention.

Kevin Durant couldn\u2019t play at all because of his recovery from Achilles surgery \u2014 yet still got a $1 million contract bonus because Brooklyn made the postseason.

He\u2019s gone, of course, becoming the only Finals MVP to leave his team for another immediately after winning the award. The Clippers signed him in free agency to team with Paul George for what they think will be their best chance ever to reach The Finals and win an NBA championship. The Raptors did just that with Leonard last year and believe they can do it again without him. The most generous interpretation of where Toronto is now, without Leonard, goes like this: Having one of the league\u2019s elite two-way players for even one season helped mold the Raptors into the steely contender they are. Leonard, a notorious man of few words publicly, left a far greater impression on the teammates and coaches he eventually left behind last July. \u201cListen, Kawhi was a great pro in a lot of facets,\u201d said coach Nick Nurse, whose team can clinch the Atlantic Division title tonight with a victory over East rival Boston  (TNT, 9 p.m. ET) . \u201c I think he understood the workday, he took care of his body, he did everything he needed to do skill-wise, he was locked in as a teammate and a coachable guy. \u201cI was always super impressed with his eye contact. (He) seemingly was always there, in every meeting, film session, timeout, halftime, you know, he was nodding along with what you were saying. And that for a youngish coach is good, right, it helps you.\u201d The players picked up on that and more. \u201cHis demeanor, his defensive mindset, jeez, what else?\u201d Nurse said. \u201cA lot of things, the way he handled the ups and downs, he didn\u2019t show much emotion. I think there\u2019s a lot there to learn from, and hopefully sticks with some of our younger guys.\u201d Learning in the presence of greatness can be a wonderful thing, as the Raptors showed in snagging the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy and putting past playoff disappointments behind them. There\u2019s no denying Leonard\u2019s impact, and it lingers in the likes of Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby. But much of the learning was going on in real time last year \u2014 Toronto went 17-5 in games their All-Star wing didn\u2019t play, mostly due to his \u201cload management\u201d nights off \u2014 and it has proven to be awfully sticky in this extended season. A case can be made that Toronto is better post-Leonard than it was with him. Including their 3-0 start in Orlando, the Raptors have won seven straight dating back to March and are 24-4 since mid-January. At 49-18, they\u2019re locked into second place in the East, waiting for the Nets and the Magic to sort out the bottom of the bracket for their first-round matchup. Offensively, Toronto has dipped by some measures, from fifth in offensive rating (112.6) in 2018-19 to 12th (111.0). But remember, they lost 26.6 points per game when Leonard headed West, and another 10.3 when Danny Green took his \u201c3-and-D\u201d to the Lakers. So far, though, the Raptors have shouldered the shortfall by committee. Kyle Lowry, Siakam, Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell have upped their involvement by a combined 26.2 points and 19.5 shots, spreading around Leonard\u2019s 18.8 per game. Anunoby, Serge Ibaka and rookie Terence Davis, with 12.1 additional points between them, have more than covered Green\u2019s share. Lowry and Siakam are doing what stars are supposed to do: stepping into any void they can. Powell is back on track to the promise he showed in the 2017 postseason, a key to the second unit and a legit Most Improved Player candidate if the ballots went deeper than three. But VanVleet has made the biggest strides overall, and not just in scoring (plus-6.9 points from a year ago). His minutes and usage are both up, with the ball and the decision-making in his hands more. Undrafted in 2016 out of Wichita State, you only have to go three deep with that draft class before you start second-guessing players (Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn) considered more NBA-worthy than the native of Rockford, Ill. \u201cIt\u2019s deceiving because you\u2019re kind of seeing him bring the ball up the floor, running up the floor or whatever, and you think, \u2018Well, he\u2019s not that athletic or fast or quick or anything,\u2019\u201d Nurse said recently. \u201cBut his side-to-side athleticism is outstanding. That\u2019s why he can get into the ball, and he can kind of uses his torso to stay in front of people and that kind of stuff. He\u2019s just got great IQ. He anticipates. He\u2019s a step ahead sometimes.\u201d It\u2019s inevitable that VanVleet\u2019s defense would get discussed, because that\u2019s pretty much Topic A for every member of this season\u2019s Toronto team. If there\u2019s one area really lingering from Leonard\u2019s 106-game stay, it\u2019s that side of the ball. The Raptors have been so committed, so tenacious, the whole league might want to start spelling it \u201cdefence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of will,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of continuous effort. It\u2019s not one effort that\u2019s going to stop the play. It\u2019s not two, it\u2019s not three. We\u2019ll continue to make efforts and make it as tough as possible for the other team and continuing possessions with rebounding. \u201cAnd I think, in our locker room, if you don\u2019t have the will or the discipline to play defense, it is going to be really hard for you to see the floor, and that gives the coaches a lot of credit, right?\u201d The Raptors rank second in defensive rating (104.5), behind only Milwaukee\u2019s 102.1. But they\u2019re more aggressive out to the 3-point line than the Bucks, who pack the paint and essentially dare opponents to hit their 3s. Milwaukee gives up the most 3-point attempts in the league and ranks 17th in defensive percentage (.356) on 3s. The Raptors give up the second-most but are the best (.334) at forcing misses. But wait, there\u2019s more: They rank second in defensive field-goal percentage, up from fifth last season; second in steals and turnovers forced, up from ninth and 10th, respectively; and first in shots and points allowed, up from 16th and ninth, respectively. \u201cBefore a pass is ever made,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have some desire, you have to have some readiness, you got to have some anticipation, you\u2019ve got to have some IQ. We\u2019ve got a bunch of guys that are locked in on that. They pay attention to the game plans, they\u2019re basketball guys, they watch the other teams, they study them, they like stopping them. It\u2019s kind of an interesting thing that they\u2019ve got going.\u201d It\u2019s a pride thing now, with peer pressure and expectations taking over beyond any coach\u2019s pleas. \u201cWhat is your character like?\u201d VanVleet explained. \u201cDo you have defensive-minded guys? Do you have guys who are [ticked] off when they get scored on? That\u2019s kind of the beginning of it, and then it gets to the point once you\u2019ve got enough of that, you look bad when you don\u2019t play defense. Like you stick out like a sore thumb. \u201cSo when guys are watching the game you can tell when a guy\u2019s not on the same page as everybody else. It looks bad and guys feel that, and you don\u2019t want to be that guy ever on the court.\u201d That\u2019s championship-level thinking, a level the Raptors reached with Leonard and have built on ever since. Now they are poised to become the first NBA champion to lose its Finals MVP and still repeat. \u201cIt\u2019s great bar talk,\u201d Gasol said of the Raptors\u2019 lofty ambitions. \u201cWe are not easy to beat, and we believe in ourselves. You go out there and you compete, and you can beat anybody. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know we have a lot of pieces and so I don\u2019t need somebody to tell me we can win it.\u201d (Pssst .

(AP) \u2014 This is the land of in-between for the Los Angeles Lakers. Games right now matter, in the sense that only three contests are left to build momentum for the postseason. And games right now don\u2019t matter, in the sense that the Lakers basically knew five months ago that they would be the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. They lost again Thursday night, with LeBron James getting the night off in a defeat to the Houston Rockets . The Lakers are 2-3 so far in the bubble, and their offensive numbers are brutal. There are 22 teams here at the NBA restart at Walt Disney World. Of those 22, the Lakers \u2014 the team with the second-best record in the NBA \u2014 rank last in field goal percentage (.408), last in 3-point percentage (.234), last in points per game (98.8) and next-to-last in free throw percentage (.729). \u201cThis is a totally different season, a totally different drastic situation for all of us, including myself,\u201d James said this week. If they win Game 1 of the playoffs in about a week and a half, none of this will matter. If they win the NBA title in a couple months, this will be long forgotten. But right now, the Lakers sure don\u2019t seem like a team that\u2019s going to be rolling into the postseason. \u201cI do believe in percentages,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cI do believe in guys trusting the work that they put in. And there\u2019s always a reversion to the mean. The law of averages plays out and I\u2019m OK with getting all these misses out of the way right now.\u201d James didn\u2019t play against Houston because of what the Lakers described as a sore groin muscle. There have been plenty of instances over the years where James has taken games off toward the end of the regular season once his team\u2019s playoff seed was certain. But this falls under what he was saying when he called this \u201ca totally different season,\u201d or as the NBA calls games at this restart, a Whole New Game. Having more than four months off isn\u2019t ideal for anyone, including James, who is a creature of habit and rhythm. And while he\u2019s had flashes of his typical MVP-caliber self at Disney, they haven\u2019t been constant. He came into the restart averaging 25.7 points, 10.6 assists and 7.9 rebounds on 50% shooting from the field, 35% from 3-point range. In his four games at Disney, James is averaging 19.3 points, 10 rebounds and 6.3 assists on 42% shooting, 27% from 3-point range. For just about anyone else on the planet, those are fine numbers. For James, it shows his best form isn\u2019t there yet. \u201cThis is a totally different situation than any other situation that I\u2019ve been in in my career, so I have zero experience with having the No. 1 seed inside of a bubble during seeding games playing in August,\u201d James said. \u201cSo, this is all a learning experience for all of us and we\u2019re going to take it day-by-day and continue to work on our habits, either on the floor, during the film session, when we\u2019re able to get on the floor as well.\u201d He\u2019s right: the habits need some work. The Lakers have three of the four lowest-scoring games played in the bubble through Thursday: They had 97 against the Rockets, 92 against Toronto on Aug. 1 and 86 against Oklahoma City on Wednesday. The only other team with a point total like that so far in the restart is Utah, which had 94 against the Thunder on Aug. 1. The Lakers also have the two worst field-goal percentage games in the bubble through Thursday, as well as the two worst 3-point shooting games. They don\u2019t seem panicked, because nothing counts yet. And there is a silver lining ahead: The Lakers play their last seeding game on Aug. 13, which could be as many as five days before their playoff opener because of the West play-in series that now seems all-but assured. In other words, the Lakers will have time to start looking like themselves again. \u201cObviously, it is a situation for us that we\u2019re not shooting the ball well,\u201d Lakers wing Kyle Kuzma said. \u201cBut we also know we have proven commodities.\u201d"},{"id":26614,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/schuhmann-film-study-pelicans-season-restart","date":"2020-08-07","title":"Film Study: Zion Williamson showing his stuff in season restart","content":" Stuck in the middle of a six-team race for eighth and ninth place, the New Orleans Pelicans have work to do in order to qualify for the Western Conference play-in scenario. Their schedule remains favorable. But, given how poorly they defended against Sacramento on Thursday, no assumptions can be made about their ability to win going forward. In a situation that called for urgency and effort, the Pelicans allowed 140 points on 102 possessions, their worst defensive performance in a season littered with them. > Playoff picture: Latest standings & tie-breakers The 140-125 defeat was New Orleans\u2019 most efficient offensive game in the restart, and it came with 24 points in less than 22 minutes from Zion Williamson (who took all 12 of his shots in the restricted area). Through 23 career games, Williamson has taken 285 (84%) of his 340 shots in the restricted area. That\u2019s the third-highest rate among 238 players with at least 300 total field goal attempts, lower than only those of Mitchell Robinson (96%) and Rudy Gobert (90%). The rookie made four 3-pointers in his debut, but has made just two since then and is 3-for-11 from mid-range. Williamson is not yet comfortable shooting from the outside, but he can be a force inside, especially against a defense on the move. The Pelicans didn\u2019t use Williamson as a ball-screener much against Memphis on Monday. They did so early and often on Thursday and results were good, in part because the Kings initially preferred not to get in front of him. Once they did, other shots presented themselves. Play 1. On the first play of the game, Williamson sets a back-to-the-baseline screen for Jrue Holiday along the left sideline. Holiday hits Williamson with a pocket pass and Williamson finishes between the recovering Richaun Holmes and the weak-side helper, Nemanja Bjelica. Number to know: Williamson has averaged 21.5 points in the paint per 36 minutes , the highest rate for any player (minimum 500 minutes played) in the 24 seasons for which points in the paint have been tracked. Play 2. On the Pelicans\u2019 next possession, Williamson sets a screen in the same spot, but for Brandon Ingram to get toward the middle of the floor. With the other three Pelicans stationed on the weak side, the Kings don\u2019t have anybody in position to tag Williamson\u2019s roll to the rim. Number to know: Williamson leads the league with 15.7 points in the restricted area per game. Play 3. Williamson sets another \u201cpistol\u201d screen along the right sideline for Lonzo Ball, who hits him with another pocket pass. This time, the Kings\u2019 defense collapses to keep Williamson from getting to the basket. He reads the defense and kicks out to Holiday in the weak-side corner. Holiday lets Bjelica fly by and drains the side-step 3. Number to know: The Pelicans have seen the league\u2019s third-biggest jump in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range, from 32.4% ( 24th ) last season to 40.6% ( ninth ) this season. Play 4. On a sideline out-of-bounds play, the Pelicans run an Ingram\/Williamson pick-and-roll. Williamson catches another pocket pass above the foul line, but is able to get by the recovering Harry Giles and draw a foul. Number to know: Before Williamson made his debut, the Pelicans ranked 24th in free throw rate (24.0 attempts per 100 shots from the field). Since his debut, they rank ninth (28.3). Play 5. When the Kings deny Ingram the ball, Williamson flashes to the top of the key and runs a hand-off with Ball. Weak-side defender De\u2019Aaron Fox just swipes at the ball, rather than get in front of Williamson\u2019s roll to the rim. Number to know: Ball has played 1,359 minutes with Ingram and just 496 minutes with Williamson, but he has almost as many assists to the rookie ( 66 ) as he does to the vet ( 71 ). Play 6. On another Ingram\/Williamson pick-and-roll on the right side of the floor, Bogdan Bogdanovic steps in front of Williamson\u2019s roll and Holmes retreats to prevent the pocket pass. But that allows Ingram to step into a mid-range jumper. He got a similar look from the left wing against a retreating Alex Len later in the third quarter. Number to know: Ingram has averaged 36.4 points + rebounds + assists per 36 minutes, up from 28.0 last season . That\u2019s the third-biggest jump (smaller than only those of second-year players Luka Doncic and Devonte\u2019 Graham) among 267 players who have played at least 500 minutes in each of the last two seasons. Play 7. On another right-side-of the-floor pick-and-roll with Holiday, Cory Joseph leaves Ball to help on the roll. Holiday finds Ball in the left corner, but he misses the open 3. Number to know: Redick ( from 39.7% to 45.2% ) and Ball ( from 32.9% to 37.7% ) have seen the seventh and 12th biggest jumps in 3-point percentage, respectively, among 103 players with at least 200 3-point attempts in each of the last two seasons. This season, 76.5% of Williamson\u2019s buckets have been assisted. That\u2019s the 36th highest rate among 172 players with at least 200 total field goals. But the Pelicans will often let the rookie go to work, either in isolation or in the post. On Thursday, it was a mix of both\u2026 Play 1. Williamson sets a cross-screen for Frank Jackson, but with Bogdanovic \u201ctop-locking\u201d Jackson, he cuts through the paint, drawing some help from Len and leaving Williamson alone on the right side of the floor. Holiday pitches him the ball and he quickly attacks before Len can get back in front. Number to know: Since Williamson made his debut on Jan. 22, the Pelicans have been 8.9 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (plus-6.7) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (minus-2.2). Play 2. Williamson posts up against Holmes, who meets him on his initial spin move toward the baseline. Williamson then spins back to his left hand (his preferred move no matter which side of the floor he\u2019s posting up on) and squeezes between Holmes and the double-team from Bjelica. Number to know: The Pelicans\u2019 starting lineup \u2013 Ball, Holiday, Ingram, Williamson and Derrick Favors \u2013 has outscored its opponents by 18.9 points per 100 possessions, the third-best mark among 38 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together. Play 3. Ingram clears out so Williamson can isolate against Bjelica on the left side of the floor. The rookie beats him going left, draws a foul, and finishes. Number to know: Williamson has accounted for 45.7% of the fouls the Pelicans have drawn while he\u2019s been on the floor. That\u2019s the sixth-highest rate among 333 players who have played at least 500 minutes. Play 4. After some switching, Williamson posts up Bjelica. Favors tries to clear out, but his defender \u2014 De\u2019Aaron Fox \u2014 stays around to double-team Williamson. He knocks the way on a spin toward the baseline, but Williamson recovers the ball and lays it in. Number to know: Williamson\u2019s 7.0 post-ups per game rank seventh in the league , according to Second Spectrum tracking. Play 5. Holiday passes ahead to Williamson, who has a mismatch (Joseph) in transition. He doesn\u2019t attack it right away and when he gets the ball back, Holmes comes with a double-team and contests a jump hook. Number to know: The 0.94 points per possession that Williamson has scored on post-up possessions rank ninth among 23 players that have averaged at least 2.5 post-up possessions per game, according to Synergy play-type tracking. That last play was one of only two shots that Williamson missed on Thursday. He had a tougher time in the paint against the Grizzlies three days earlier, struggling to finish in a crowd here , here and here . As big and strong as he is (and despite the 10-for-12 performance on Thursday), Williamson has shot just 63.2% in the restricted area. That mark is a tick below the league average (63.4%) and ranks 58th among 96 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. When a player takes almost all his shots at the rim, defenses will just wait for him there. The Grizzlies were a little more willing to get in front of Williamson when he went to the basket than the Kings were, and they blocked Williamson three times. For the season, Williamson has been blocked 2.1 times per 36 minutes, most among 333 players who have played at least 500 minutes. A 6-foot-6 guy who takes almost all of his shots at the rim is going to get blocked more than a seven-footer or someone who shoots from the outside. Of course, when those defenses bring extra bodies to meet Williamson at the rim, things can open up for his teammates. The Pelicans rank first in player movement (12.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession, second in ball movement (383 passes per 24 minutes of possession) and sixth in assist percentage (having recorded assists on 63.3% of their buckets). Williamson, though he hasn\u2019t been asked to make plays for others, has shown signs of being both a willing and intuitive passer. Play 1. When Ball picks up his dribble after a hand-off from Favors, Holmes jumps out to deny a pass to Williamson. The rookie goes back door and Ball hits him with a pass. Bjelica slides over to help and Williamson drops the ball off for a Favors dunk. Number to know: The Pelicans have outscored their opponents by 12.5 points per 100 possessions in 355 minutes with Williamson and Favors on the floor together. That\u2019s the team\u2019s best on-court mark among its 49 two-man combinations that have played at least 250 minutes. Play 2. Against the Grizzlies, Melli slips out of a screen for Ball and goes to set one for Williamson in the right corner. (He doesn\u2019t have to, because Jonas Valanciunas isn\u2019t anywhere near Williamson). When Williamson attacks off the catch, Kyle Anderson (guarding Melli) steps in front. Williamson pivots and hits Melli for an open 3. Number to know: The Pelicans rank fifth in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (38.8%). Play 3. Williamson doesn\u2019t touch the ball here, but when he runs ahead of JJ Redick on the break, he gets Anthony Tolliver to sink toward the paint. That leaves Redick open beyond the arc and Tolliver fouls him on his recovery. Number to know: The Pelicans lead the league with 19.5 \u201cpass-ahead\u201d passes per game, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Ball (8.6) and Holiday (6.7) rank first and third among individuals. Williamson has had immediate chemistry with Ball, which often manifests in thunderous dunks off long lob passes \u2026 But the ideal on-court complement for Williamson may be Redick, who had terrific two-man chemistry with a similarly burly Joel Embiid in Philadelphia. Pairing a player who must be kept from the basket with one who teams must run off the 3-point line can give opposing defenses very difficult decisions to make. With Redick coming off the bench and Williamson often seeing his playing time limited to the first five minutes of each quarter, the two have played just 140 minutes together this season. Williamson has played more minutes with six other teammates . But we have seen the early stages of a Redick-Williamson two-man game\u2026 Play 1. Ball enters the ball to Williamson above the right elbow. The play is for Ball to set a screen for Redick, who then heads into a hand-off from Williamson. But with Dillon Brooks top-locking Redick, he goes back door and Williamson hits him with a bounce pass for a layup. Number to know: The Pelican average a league-low 2.68 seconds per touch and a league-low 1.91 dribbles per touch . Play 2. The Pelicans run the same play on the next possession. This time, Redick uses the Ball screen, takes the hand-off from Williamson, and drains a 3-pointer off one dribble. Brooks gets hit by both picks and can\u2019t recover in time. Number to know: Redick has shot 41.2% on pull-up 3-pointers, the second best mark among 62 players who have attempted at least 100. Play 3. The Pelicans run the same play on the next possession. This time (with Grayson Allen initially guarding Redick), the Grizzlies switch the Ball screen and Brooks can deny the hand-off. So Williamson uses Redick (and Brooks) as his own ball screen and attacks the paint. He collapses the defense and passes to Melli for a wide-open 3. But Melli passes up the shot and Redick misses a contested pull-up. Number to know: In four games since the restart, Redick has been on the floor for 30 of Williamson\u2019s 76 minutes. The Pelicans have been outscored by 26 points in those 30 minutes. Play 4. Against the Kings, the Pelicans run a quick-hitting baseline out-of-bounds play, with Redick curling to the corner off a screen from Williamson. Holmes jumps out to contest the jumper, Redick hits Williamson rolling to the rim, and the Kings foul the rookie. Number to know: Williamson has a free throw rate of 50.6 attempts per 100 shots from the field. That\u2019s the sixth highest rate among 238 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. Play 5. Redick flashes to the ball along the left sideline and hands off to Williamson, with Fox staying attached to the shooter. Holmes slides under the hand-off, but Williamson gets him leaning with an in-and-out dribble and finishes at the rim. Number to know: The Pels have have had possession for just 41.1% of games, the league\u2019s second lowest rate (higher than only that of the Rockets \u2013 41.0%), according to Second Spectrum tracking. Play 6. When Joseph denies a Redick curl off a Williamson screen, Redick circles back to the left corner. Williamson gets the ball and Joseph continues to top-lock Redick, preventing the hand-off. Redick tries to use both himself and Joseph as a screen for Williamson, but Holmes can slide under the guards and prevent the drive. Williamson gets the ball back to Redick for a late-clock pick-and-roll along the sideline, but Holmes traps it and Buddy Hield drops off Ball to intercept the pass to Williamson on the roll. Number to know: The Pelicans rank 29th in turnover percentage (15.5 per 100 possessions). Williamson must improve his shooting at some point. These were the Pelicans\u2019 first two possessions of the third quarter against Memphis on Monday \u2026 But Williamson is already an offensive force without a jumper. He\u2019s shown a knack for attacking the seams of a rotating defense, bullying smaller guys in the post, beating everyone to a loose ball or offensive rebound, and pulling defenders into the paint to open things up for his teammates. In the preseason (small sample size alert), the Pelicans were dominant with Williamson at center, and it would seem ideal to surround him with four guys who can shoot. But in the regular season thus far, the Pelicans have been more efficient offensively (and much , much , much better defensively) in 355 minutes with Williamson and Favors on the floor together ( 113.1 points scored per 100 possessions ) than they\u2019ve been in 267 minutes with Williamson on the floor without either Favors or Jaxson Hayes ( 111.2 per 100 ). Hayes isn\u2019t quite ready to play a big role on a good team and Favors is a free agent this fall, so it will be interesting to see how much the Pelicans want to keep the 10-year veteran (who\u2019s still just 29 years old) around. Williamson will be around for a long time. Over the next 10 seasons, he could evolve quite a bit. But it\u2019s already been interesting to see how the Pelicans use his special combination of size and skills. It would be even more interesting to see how a playoff defense tries to neutralize him. But if we\u2019re going to get that opportunity, the Pelicans\u2019 own defense will have to be much better over the next seven days. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

We\u2019re both 6-foot-8, can execute a 360-degree dunk, will pull up for a 3-pointer on the run and make roughly $28 million a year. Actually, none of that is true on my end. And here\u2019s something else: George loves to fish and I\u2019d rather just eat fish.  There are hundreds of lakes in Central Florida, dozens on the Walt Disney World property and a few just outside the NBA hotels on the campus here. Guests can rent poles at each hotel, where bridges and walkways are conveniently situated around the water to encourage anglers to bait up and reel out. Much like golf, plenty of NBA players are getting their first-ever taste of fishin\u2019 here at Disney. That\u2019s not a typo, either. That\u2019s the correct term used by country folk and serious anglers. They don\u2019t \u201cfish.\u201d They don\u2019t do \u201cfishing.\u201d They go fishin\u2019. George goes fishin\u2019. It\u2019s a passion of his, ever since he was a kid growing up in Palmdale, which is a country town near Los Angeles. George holds a fishin\u2019 expedition every summer and all of his Clippers teammates have a free invite. A few years ago while playing with Oklahoma City, he took Russell Westbrook out on the boat. Russ is a city kid, from south L.A., and he clearly just went along for the ride. According to well-placed sources, Westbrook hasn\u2019t held a worm and a hook ever since. If given the choice between fishin\u2019 or going out to dinner with Kevin Durant, I suspect it\u2019ll be dinner for Westbrook; maybe he\u2019ll order fish. The last time I went fishin\u2019 was at age 12, in a Pittsburgh city park, and you can just imagine the quality of fish caught in the western part of Pennsylvania, which will never be mistaken for Alaska or Florida or wherever else \u201creal\u201d fish is plentiful. We fished for carp, which I understand is the bottom-barrel of fish. Real fishermen would never admit to fishin\u2019 for carp. Now, many years later, I have a chance to atone for that poor judgment. The Disney folk, from what I understand, restocked the lakes to make it easier for first-time NBA players to actually catch something other than guppies. That\u2019ll also make it easier for me, and so this weekend I\u2019ll rent a pole and figure out the hard part \u2014 how to bait the hook. And then the even harder part: How to unhook the fish. Assuming, of course, that I actually catch one. Yes, this is all rather pathetic. A sophisticated adult such as myself should be well-rounded and schooled on all of life\u2019s pleasures by now, yet for some reason fishin\u2019 escaped me. That\u2019s about to end, starting this weekend. Reporters sometimes resort to tricks in order to develop a bond with subjects. One method is to immerse ourselves in that subject\u2019s passion in order to get the conversation started and make interviews go smoothly. Which means Paul George and I will have plenty to talk about very soon. First question: Paul, what\u2019s the best way to unhook the fish? I gave up and just cut the wire instead. Well on second thought, if that\u2019s the first question to someone who\u2019s an expert on fishin, there might not be a next question. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

But what\u2019s transpired in the four seeding games for each of these teams indicates a difficult, yet entertaining road ahead, especially for the three teams (Memphis, New Orleans and Sacramento) coming out of those first four outings with losing records. When the NBA restart began at Walt Disney World, Memphis held the No. 8 spot , followed by (in order) Portland, Sacramento, New Orleans, San Antonio and Phoenix. The surprising Suns remain the only undefeated squad during the restart among the contenders for eighth, after capturing a 114-99 win Thursday against the Indiana Pacers. That victory was fueled by another strong performance from Devin Booker (20 points and 10 assists), who is averaging 28 points and 6.5 assists during the restart. Booker continues to receive plenty of timely contributions from Deandre Ayton and Cameron Johnson, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve come in with the right approach every day,\u201d Booker said. \u201cCoach [Monty Williams] always says the word \u2018approach\u2019, and since Day 1 that we got here, [in] the practices we\u2019ve been going hard and the few games that we\u2019ve played we\u2019ve stuck together and came out with some big wins.\u201d Phoenix sits at 10th in the conference standings , but just two games behind the Grizzlies for eighth and 1 1\/2 behind Portland for ninth. \u201cWe\u2019re humans, right?\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe look at that stuff. But it\u2019s not always the primary focus. Everybody has a goal of making the playoffs, but there\u2019s stuff we\u2019re gonna have to do to get there. So, we just try to dial in on those things. If we take care of those things, we may have a chance. That\u2019s our mentality. We\u2019re grateful to be here. \u201cWe\u2019re humble about the opportunity, and yet, we attack it. These guys want it. I don\u2019t have to wind anybody up. This is our DNA. This is who we are. We play hard every night. We compete every night. We defend. We share the ball. That\u2019s the identity, and we don\u2019t want that to change.\u201d The injury-riddled Grizzlies, meanwhile, lost each of their first four seeding games, including the first three to teams chasing them for the final playoff spot in the West. Memphis\u2019 situation only worsened Monday in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, with Jaren Jackson Jr. suffering a torn left meniscus that will put him out for the rest of the season. The defeat to Utah on Wednesday gave the Grizzlies their fifth in a row, and they\u2019ve dropped 11 of their last 15 outings going back to February. The Grizzlies have allowed opponents to shoot 41% from deep in their first four seeding games. Still, they\u2019re clinging to that eighth spot, barely, despite entering the NBA bubble with some cushion. \u201cThe media [is] gonna [say], \u2018Well, they had this lead. Now, they have this lead and somebody\u2019s coming to take it,\u2019 \u201d Grizzlies guard Ja Morant said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay attention to that. All that will lead to is us trying to put pressure on ourselves, which we don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re learning from everything we\u2019re going through right now, still have four games to play. We\u2019re just gonna attack those four games.\u201d Portland pulled to within a half game of the Grizzlies by downing the Nuggets, but San Antonio and Phoenix lurk close behind Memphis in the standings. \u201cI would\u2019ve hoped that we played better, and we didn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s all magnified in a four-game stretch where, yes, we\u2019re 0-4, and haven\u2019t gotten a win. It hasn\u2019t shaken our way. But our guys are still getting better. We\u2019re learning a lot from game to game. I don\u2019t have to constantly be on them about, \u2018Keep your spirits up.\u2019 \u201cWe obviously miss J.J. \u2026 But these guys, they keep fighting. We\u2019ve had chances in four straight games. That\u2019s a credit to these guys that are unified no matter what our depth chart is.\u201d They\u2019ll need more moving forward, as the fight only intensifies for Memphis on Friday, when it faces Oklahoma City ( 4 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). New Orleans entered the NBA\u2019s restart as one of the favorites to squeeze into the eighth spot behind rookie sensation Zion Williamson and veteran guard Jrue Holiday. However, the Pelicans have stumbled to 1-3 in their first four seeding games, and are 3-6 since March, surrendering 120 points or more in five of those six defeats. Williamson dropped 24 points on 10-of-12 shooting in 22 minutes in Thursday\u2019s loss to Sacramento, which finally won its first game of restart. Interestingly, New Orleans is 0-5 this season when Williamson plays fewer than 25 minutes. But Williamson isn\u2019t sure if or when the team plans to increase his minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t really answer that question right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to go talk to the coaches, go talk to the staff and see where everybody\u2019s head is at.\u201d The issue for New Orleans is it wants to take a long-term approach with managing Williamson\u2019s minutes, after he missed time due to leaving the NBA bubble to tend to a family matter. Pelicans vice president David Griffin has made it clear the team won\u2019t sacrifice Williamson\u2019s long-term health in this fight to make the postseason for the first time since 2018. The Pelicans gave up 49 points in the first quarter during Thursday\u2019s loss to the Kings. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have a margin for error,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who stood with his arms crossed for the entirety of his nearly six-minute postgame interview on Zoom. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that we don\u2019t care. I think our guys really care. They understand the sense of urgency we\u2019re in right now. Nothing is gonna be easy down here.\u201d As for the Spurs, despite winning two of their first four games of the restart missing three starters in LaMarcus Aldridge, Bryn Forbes and Trey Lyles, while fielding a starting lineup featuring DeMar DeRozan at power forward, it appears they face long odds to advance to the postseason for what would be an NBA record 23rd-consecutive season. Given its lineup limitations and relative youth, San Antonio entered the restart looking to develop its youth for the future. The Spurs are 14-23 against teams with records better than .500 after falling Wednesday to Denver. But third-year guard Derrick White has scored 20 points or more in three of the team\u2019s first four seeding games, while other youngsters such as Lonnie Walker IV, Keldon Johnson and Dejounte Murray continue to gain valuable experience. \u201cThis whole approach is all about them,\u201d veteran guard Patty Mills said. \u201cIt\u2019s for them to be able to play meaningful games, develop the way that we believe they can grow into and the potential they have. So, look, two losses in the row, obviously is the result, but I think we\u2019re playing good basketball. The style we\u2019re playing is good and guys are getting better. For me it\u2019s big picture. It\u2019s not great to say after a loss because you always want to win. \u201cBut when you understand where we were, where we\u2019re going and the process that we\u2019re taking and where we\u2019re trying to be. And this group is being put together to be able to go out there and get the job done with what we have. It\u2019s a process and everyone understands that process. \u201d As for Trail Blazers, Stotts quickly pointed out the reality that \u201cthere are so many teams that are right in the thick of things that nobody is even close to a magic number\u201d in terms of how many wins it will take to ultimately secure a postseason berth. The six teams in contention in the West receive four more opportunities in the coming days to make their case. That\u2019s what Lillard wanted all along. Lillard told Yahoo\u2019s Chris Haynes back in May that he didn\u2019t want to play if his team wouldn\u2019t receive at least a chance to advance to the postseason once the NBA resumed the season. Now with a fully healthy roster at the ready with Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins back in the fold , it appears Portland\u2019s chances are as good as anybody\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m always optimistic, and always see the best in situations, especially a situation like this,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cIt was also why I said what I said months ago when I said that if we don\u2019t have a chance to compete for a playoff spot, I don\u2019t want to play. Because I knew that if we did have a chance to play for a playoff spot, it would look something like it looks right now, because we are a more healthy team, we\u2019re more rested. \u201cI knew that once we got here, we would be one of the teams that would take advantage of it, and so far, we are.\u201d * * * Michael C.

There are floor burns, primal screams, busy scoreboards, tense fourth quarters and photo finishes. And if fans were allowed inside the arenas here on the Disney campus, there\u2019d be plenty of authentic noise and standing ovations, too. Thursday marks one full week since the NBA reopened for business, and given the high quality of play and intensity and performances, it\u2019s hard to believe the players were off for 4 1\/2 months. This was a realistic concern heading into the restart. During the season hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic, players couldn\u2019t maintain NBA shape, lacked access to sufficient training centers and because of social distancing were unable to scrimmage when those centers opened. Everything shut down so abruptly. All things considered, it was the longest halftime in NBA history. So the fears were legit. Yet, who can tell? Plenty of games at Disney have been suspenseful and some dramatic, all peppered by big moments and some individual shine. And the league is still in the seeded portion of the revamped schedule, the equivalent of playing out the dog days of a typical early April. This sneak peek only bodes well for the playoffs when they begin Aug. 17 and the psyche of teams who wondered if there was enough time to prepare for that intensity, and also fans who questioned whether the layoff might cause the entertainment level to dip. One week into this bold experiment, the NBA has looked better than all reasonable expectations, not only off the court \u2014 no positive tests for COVID-19 among 343 players for a third week \u2014 but especially on it. \u201cI definitely expected guys on every team to be competitive,\u201d said Rockets forward PJ Tucker. \u201cAll the games have been close for the most part, very few blowouts, guys are coming out to compete every night. I think once the game gets taken from you like that, everybody\u2019s just so thankful and excited to get back here. So the transition\u2019s been good. It\u2019s a good quality product right now for regular-season games, for the players and the fans.\u201d On re-opening night, the only two games on the schedule were both decided by two points . Of the 37 games played the over next six nights, only seven were what you\u2019d classify as lemons. Devin Booker dropped the Clippers on a buzzer-beater . The Rockets outlasted the Mavericks 153-149 in overtime. Multiple games were decided in the final minute and several others in the final seconds. What\u2019s unique is that, with the exception of the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, there isn\u2019t anything up for grabs. The Lakers have already clinched best record in the West and the Bucks are on the verge of doing so in the East. Aside from some minor shuffling in the playoff order, there\u2019s little at stake \u2026 and yet the intensity seems playoff-ready. As Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said after his team, which is virtually assured of staying as the No. 7 seed in the West, took a 114-110 overtime win over the Kings: \u201cOur collective will to win the game was the strongest I\u2019ve seen all year.\u201d All year? This wasn\u2019t an exception \u2014 the rule in Orlando is quality basketball and players who aren\u2019t rusty, but restless, and it shows. TJ Warren, who was virtually given away by the Suns last summer, is carrying a Pacers team that\u2019s without Domantas Sabonis and getting mixed results from a still-healing Victor Oladipo. Including a 53-point game , he\u2019s had three straight games of 30 or more points. Doncic owns the most robust triple-double of the restart with 34 points, 20 rebounds and 12 assists in a victory over Sacramento. Fred VanVleet managed a career-high 36 points against Miami and his steal sealed the victory. VanVleet is an unrestricted free agent this fall and his asking price is soaring. Michael Porter Jr., who two years ago dropped to the Nuggets at No. 14 on Draft day because of worries about his surgically-repaired back, had 37 points and 12 rebounds against Oklahoma City. Then he followed up with 30 against the Spurs. Gary Trent Jr. averaged 7.7 ppg before the season was suspended, but is now a fixture in the Blazers\u2019 three-guard rotation. He\u2019s had impressive showings in Orlando, averaging 18 ppg and 31.8 minutes per game through three seeding games. Speaking of the Blazers, Carmelo Anthony has answered the last-minute call in a pair of games. Not only did he make big shots, but the Blazers were respectful enough to give him the ball in those situations. Houston\u2019s Danuel House Jr. is averaging 17.7 ppg in Orlando and shooting 46.7% on 3-pointers as his role has expanded for the small-ball Rockets. Defense is perhaps the only vivid flaw as only five games saw teams held under 100 points. The consensus among coaches is players simply aren\u2019t sharp on that end of the floor yet. That said, there\u2019s a strong hunch that defense will make a return once the playoffs start (and rotations tighten and the floor shrinks). \u201cI thought there\u2019d be a chance that it would be sloppier than it has been,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cBut I guess it shows the urgency. You don\u2019t have eight continuous months to get yourself in playoff shape. You\u2019re kinda pushed to the limit and guys have responded great. \u201cI do think we\u2019re in a bit of a trough where you\u2019ll start to see some tired legs but it\u2019ll ramp back up pretty soon. I think when you take into account the time they missed, this shows that we have the best athletes in the world, period, and that what they do is amazing. There\u2019s no one else like them.\u201d The upcoming week is likely to see a shift in strategy as coaches begin resting their important players. The Bucks have already done this with Giannis Antetokounmpo, holding him out of the fourth quarter of their three-point loss to the Nets. The Lakers will eventually do the same with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and after preventing him from playing back-to-back games all season, the Clippers could put Kawhi Leonard on ice for the last few seeding games. The only restart setbacks are knee injuries that sacked the season for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jonathan Isaac . Since one week is hardly a large enough sample size, the jury is still out on the injury front and if the extended time off will claim a share of victims. This first week is merely a single step in a basketball journey that\u2019ll stretch to The Finals in October. But the solid results so far could qualify as a hint, and if so, the NBA is clearly winning. The careful and meticulous planning over the past few months by the NBA office set a high bar that the players are now reaching. The product and the execution, therefore, are combining to craft the best-case scenario at Disney. This isn\u2019t basketball business as usual or even normal \u2014 far from it. The NBA and its players are just trying to make it seem that way. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Foundation is being launched in partnership with the National Basketball Players Association.  Over the next 10 years, the 30 NBA team owners will collectively contribute $30 million annually to establish a new, leaguewide charitable foundation. Through its mission to drive economic empowerment for Black communities through employment and career advancement, the NBA Foundation will seek to increase access and support for high school, college-aged and career-ready Black men and women, and assist national and local organizations that provide skills training, mentorship, coaching and pipeline development in NBA markets and communities across the United States and Canada. As a public charity, the Foundation will also aim to work strategically with marketing and media partners to develop additional programming and funding sources that deepen the NBA family\u2019s commitment to racial equality and social justice.  The Foundation will focus on three critical employment transition points: obtaining a first job, securing employment following high school or college, and career advancement once employed. Through contributions, the NBA Foundation will enhance and grow the work of national and local organizations dedicated to education and employment, including through investment in youth employment and internship programs, STEM fields, job shadows and apprenticeships, development pathways outside of traditional higher education, career placement, professional mentorship, networking and specific partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. \u201cOn behalf of the NBA Board of Governors, I am thrilled to announce the creation of the NBA Foundation,\u201d said NBA Board of Governors Chairman and Toronto Raptors Governor Larry Tanenbaum. \u201cAll NBA team governors recognize our unique position to effect change and we are committed to supporting and empowering young Black men and women in each of our team markets as well as communities across the U.S. and Canada.\u201d \u201cThe creation of this foundation is an important step in developing more opportunities for the Black community,\u201d said NBPA President Chris Paul. \u201cI am proud of our league and our players for their commitment to this long-term fight for equality and justice, and I know we will continue to find ways to keep pushing for meaningful institutional change.\u201d The Foundation will work directly with all 30 teams, their affiliated charitable organizations and the NBPA to support national organizations and their local affiliates as well as local grassroots organizations to facilitate sustainable programming and create change in team markets.  \u201cGiven the resources and incredible platform of the NBA, we have the power to ideate, implement and support substantive policies that reflect the core principles of equality and justice we embrace,\u201d said NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts. \u201cThis Foundation will provide a framework for us to stay committed and accountable to these principles.\u201d \u201cWe are dedicated to using the collective resources of the 30 teams, the players and the league to drive meaningful economic opportunities for Black Americans,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cWe believe that through focused programs in our team markets and nationally, together with clear and specific performance measures, we can advance our shared goals of creating substantial economic mobility within the Black community.\u201d  The 30 NBA teams will be members of the NBA Foundation with its eight Board of Directors comprised of representatives from the NBA Board of Governors (four board seats), players and executives from the NBPA (three board seats) and the league office (one board seat).

He got back in the mix, but his return was ultimately short-lived. Crawford checked into Tuesday\u2019s game against the Milwaukee Bucks with 4 minutes, 35 seconds in the first quarter, marking his first NBA game action since an April 9, 2019 game against the Dallas Mavericks. His return did not last long as he suffered a left hamstring injury in the second quarter and left the game. Per the team, he would not return against the Bucks . He has since been ruled out for Wednesday\u2019s game against the Boston Celtics. Crawford scored five points in five minutes of play, shooting 2-for-4 overall (and 1-for-2 on 3-pointers) along with three assists. In getting into the game, Crawford \u2014 who is 40 years and 137 days old \u2014 became the oldest player officially in the season restart. Atlanta Hawks swingman Vince Carter (43 years, 45 days) was the oldest player to play in a game this season overall when he did so on March 11 against the New York Knicks. In addition, Crawford became the eighth player in NBA history to appear in a game in 20 different seasons. The other players to do so were Vince Carter (22 seasons), Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Robert Parish and Kevin Willis (21) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kobe Bryant (20). Crawford is also the oldest Nets player to ever appear in a game, breaking the mark set by Cliff Robinson in 2007, who was 40 years and 121 days old when he suited up vs. the New York Knicks. Milwaukee Bucks guards Eric Bledsoe and Pat Connaughton also made their debut on Tuesday. Bledsoe started for the Bucks, marking his first game action for Milwaukee since a March 8 loss to the Phoenix Suns. He and Connaughton have missed the Bucks\u2019 first two seeding games in Orlando as Milwaukee has gone 1-1 during that span. Both players began practicing with the team in late July after they each reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus in July. Bledsoe played 18 minutes and scored eight points with four assists, and Connaughton played 17 minutes and also finished with eight points. The Nets held on for the 119-116 win , getting 26 points from Timothe  Luwawu-Cabarrot. Crawford had been out of the league since the 2018-19 season, when he averaged 7.9 points and 3.6 assists in 64 games with the Suns, notably scoring 51 points off the bench (18-for-30 shooting) in the season finale. Crawford was the oldest player in league history to top 50, and also became the only player to score 50 for four different teams. In his career, Crawford has averaged 14.6 points and 3.6 assists while taking home Sixth Man of the Year Award three times.

But Thursdays are now reserved for golf and let\u2019s keep this between us. The Disney property has three high-quality courses which are mainly reserved for players and coaches, with special emphasis for LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers, which I\u2019ll explain in a bit. Yet the folks were gracious enough to give us, the media, a once-a-week tee time. I\u2019ve always gotten the impression that we\u2019re a necessary nuisance, that nobody really loves or respects the media, and that our approval rating is slightly higher than mosquitos. And then this happens, and my faith in humanity is restored.  And then we get the media tee times \u2014 four spots between 6:20 and 6:54 am only \u2014 and I begin to wonder again. Understand that, for sportswriters, early morning is our kryptonite. We work mainly at night, sometimes well beyond midnight, so by nature we\u2019re late risers. Still, golf is a passion and so you make an exception. I\u2019m late coming to golf and didn\u2019t buy my first set of clubs until I reached 38. Months later, I played my first round, and courtesy of a media perk, it was at Augusta National. I don\u2019t like to tell anyone that because, you know, haters gonna hate. Rick Reilly, the longtime writer for Sports Illustrated , became enraged when he found out, then he tracked me down and demanded to know: \u201cWas your first date Halle Berry?\u201d Well, no. But my fifth round ever was at Shinnecock, and again, keep that between us. Golf is quickly catching on with NBA folks, and nobody is more obsessed than Rivers. I once asked him if he had a bucket list of courses he\u2019d like to play \u2026 and this was the dumbest question he\u2019d ever heard in his life because he\u2019s already played them all (and some twice). Last fall at Clippers\u2019 training camp, thankfully held in Honolulu, I asked Rivers after practice if he packed his clubs. Well, that was the second-dumbest question he ever heard. Matter of fact, he and Clippers owner Steve Ballmer were headed out that afternoon. No, not at a local course, either, although Honolulu has a few gems. They were taking Ballmer\u2019s private plane to the Big Island and playing there. Now that\u2019s golf gangsta. This might be a good time to mention Ballmer is worth a few bucks. The player with the lowest handicap is probably Ray Allen, who retired so he can play even more golf. Allen stays on call to join his favorite playing partner, former President Barack Obama. Here at Disney, I get to play with Joe Vardon. Joe is a fantastic writer for The Athletic who isn\u2019t famous \u2014 although he is on first-name basis with LeBron James and therefore comes pretty close. Anyway, we\u2019ve agreed to play every Thursday morning, after staggering out of bed and bringing along flashlights so we can find our balls. There\u2019s no wagering between us, and that\u2019s great, because Joe\u2019s better than me. However, he never played at Augusta or Shinnecock, so whatever. Taking a cue from Rivers, I remembered to bring clubs. They\u2019re ready although, at that early tee time, I\u2019m not sure I will be. That\u2019s OK. Expectations aren\u2019t high in these conditions. The purpose is to survive and score at least 90, same goal as the 2019-20 Charlotte Hornets. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Williams had seven points, six assists and six rebounds in his restart debut after missing the first two games. Williams had to quarantine for 10 days after visiting a strip club in Atlanta after he was granted permission to leave the Disney bubble for a family member\u2019s funeral. He said he could have made a better decision, but that he thinks it became a bigger story that it needed to be because of where he went. \u201dAt the end of the day, I was truly grieving two weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201dI was thrown under the bus, and the attention was thrown to Magic City. If I went to a steakhouse or Hooters, it wouldn\u2019t have been a story.\u201d Williams has been in quarantine for the last 10 days because of his trip out of the Walt Disney World bubble in Orlando to attend a family member\u2019s funeral. The issue, per the NBA, was not that Williams left the bubble but that he went to a club on that trip to Atlanta. Photographs of that visit \u2014 with him wearing a type of mask the NBA distributed inside its campus at Disney World \u2014 appeared on social media. That prompted an investigation by NBA security, and ultimately the 10-day ruling. Williams visited a club that he has often described as being his favorite restaurant, and the establishment even has chicken wings that are named for him on the menu. But by being in a group of people and potentially exposing himself to coronavirus, the NBA decided that a longer quarantine was what\u2019s required to ensure the safety of those in the bubble. Williams is a Sixth Man of the Year candidate this season, averaging 18.7 points this season for the Clippers entering Tuesday\u2019s game. The Clippers have secured a playoff spot and are second in the Western Conference, 6 1\/2 games behind the Lakers and one game ahead of third-place Denver. Clippers big man Montrezl Harrell has been absent from the NBA campus due to an excused personal matter since mid-July. Rivers said Tuesday that there is no update on Harrell\u2019s status or his return to the campus. The Clippers are 1-2 so far in Orlando, losing to the rival Lakers in their first game, beating the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday and then losing to Phoenix on Tuesday. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":26654,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-devin-booker-beats-buzzer-clippers","date":"2020-08-05","title":"Horry Scale: Devin Booker's buzzer-beater sinks Clippers","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration.

Ricky Rubio missed a shot after that and Ivica Zubac got the rebound, but he threw a bad pass that Mikal Bridges poked away to give the Suns another chance with 10 seconds remaining.

They arrived at Walt Disney World for the NBA season restart a month ago and are staying in the same hotel and on the same floor. And yet the Clippers still haven\u2019t occupied all the seats on the team bus for the trips to practices and games. Of the 22 teams on the NBA campus, the Clippers are one that\u2019s missing, in a sense. What could be more appropriate, though? Their experience at Walt Disney World has mirrored their experience all season back home in Los Angeles. Meaning, disruptive. I njuries and mid-season acquisitions conspired to give the Clippers the look of a team caught hopelessly in transition from training camp through March. Just when a four-month delay in the 2019-20 season appeared to give them stability, their trip to Orlando has turned into more of the same. One starter and a key bench player arrived late due to coronavirus reasons. Another starter and a pair of leading candidates for the Kia Sixth Man of the Year Award had to leave unexpectedly with excused absences for emergencies. That\u2019s five players in an eight-man rotation being affected one way or another, and the playoffs begin Aug. 17. The good news, of course, is the Clippers are built for distractions. Otherwise, there\u2019s no chance they\u2019d have the second-best record in the Western Conference and still be projected to be in the championship mix. Having Kawhi Leonard and Paul George around does help, at least in the regular season where there\u2019s more room for error. The playoffs are different and given all the moving parts of the last several months, the Clippers can only hope they can develop championship-level chemistry on the fly. Pat Beverley flew to Chicago a week ago to attend the funeral of a close friend. He then returned last weekend and, after clearing quarantine, helped the Clippers to an easy win against the Pelicans. Beverley did play in a loss to the Lakers in the restart opener, but Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams did not as both missed the game after the deaths of family members. Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac played in both games, but were late arrivals to Orlando. Williams was cleared to play Tuesday against the Suns, while Harrell\u2019s status for the remaining five seeding games is uncertain. \u201cHad to go back home but I\u2019m able to come around my brothers, come around the coaching staff, and come here and do what I love to do most, and that\u2019s play basketball,\u201d Beverley said. Beverley was born and raised in tough Chicago surroundings and has previously mentioned how some of his boyhood friends had died by the time he reached the NBA. That upbringing prepared him for a professional path that veered through several minor leagues in a handful of countries before stabilizing in the NBA . \u201cIt seems normal for me. Been dealing with adversity since I\u2019ve been growing up so this is nothing,\u201d Beverley said of his latest personal setback. \u201cI guess I can use it as motivation. It prepares you for life.\u201d Beverley said he\u2019d like to serve as an example to others, especially those who are victimized by situations they didn\u2019t create for themselves. \u201cMy message is simple. Faith and hard work have been my mirror. When things get hard you\u2019ve got to run with it, and when things get good you run with it,\u201d Beverley said. \u201cThings are not going to be easy, things are not going to be fair. Just do your best.\u201d Without a full compliment of players in practice, the Clippers have needed to be creative while keeping the missing players in shape. Beverley was given a stationary bike in quarantine. The same was true for Williams, who had to serve 10 days \u2014 six longer than normal \u2014 after running afoul of social distancing rules while being away from Orlando. Beverley said the New Orleans game was emotional therapy for him, which was needed while the physical part is lagging. \u201cIt was good,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to clear my mind a little bit being back on the basketball court. I definitely need to get my wind up a little bit. My conditioning is not where it needs to be. But I\u2019m just happy to be back with my guys to get on that quest to win the NBA championship.\u201d  The Clippers aren\u2019t the only team feeling left behind in Orlando. The Nuggets had to halt their pre-Orlando workouts and close their practice facility because of positive tests. Their star center, Nikola Jokic, tested positive after returning to Serbia during the hiatus. They have played their seeding games without guards Jamal Murray (hamstring issue) and Gary Harris (hip) and forward Will Barton (knee). But much like the Clippers, the Nuggets have already clinched a postseason spot and therefore are understandably placing a larger priority on getting healthy for the playoffs. Unlike the Clippers, though, the Nuggets were virtually healthy all season and didn\u2019t swing any mid-season trades. Marcus Morris (trade deadline) and Reggie Jackson (acquired off waivers) were added in February while Joakim Noah was added in late June. The hiatus limited their playing time and they have yet to give Clippers teammates and coaches credible evidence of what (and how much) they can contribute. That\u2019s why the Clippers are still a work in progress. They\u2019ll need to evaluate swiftly to establish a playoff rotation. Depth won\u2019t be an issues as 10 of the Clippers\u2019 players have started for them (or other teams) over the last two seasons. Most likely, the rotation will be trimmed to eight, or nine at the most. Their depth is what gives them an advantage on most contenders \u2014 especially the Lakers, their biggest threat in the West. Finding the right mix remains crucial. The Clippers have little worry about Williams and Harrell, who\u2019ve spent the most time away from the club while in Orlando. Both are veterans with playoff experience and were healthy during this season, and their styles mesh well with Leonard and George. Conditioning may be an issue initially with them, but the big games don\u2019t begin for two weeks. Until then, the Clippers are the biggest mystery among the contenders here at the restart. Much like the 2019-20 NBA season itself, the Clippers remain a team anxious to overcome interruptions to fulfill all the early promise and projections. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Tre Maddox, another member of the three-man crew, called the foul. Lowry fell to the court on the play, which was reviewed.

Lowry was awarded two free throws and Toronto kept possession after those. \u201cAfter reviewing that more postgame, and thinking about it a little bit more, to me, it now is more of a natural basketball play going for the ball and that the contact really did not rise to the criteria of a flagrant foul,\u201d Guthrie said after the game.

(AP) \u2014 Jonathan Isaac would routinely be inside the Orlando Magic\u2019s AdventHealth practice facility by 7:15 a.m. most days this spring when the facility was open, putting in hours of work to rehabilitate a serious injury to his left knee. And now another, longer rehab regimen awaits the young forward. Isaac left the NBA\u2019s bubble at Walt Disney World on Monday for more tests on his left knee, to determine if additional damage was done when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament on a jump-stop Sunday night. Magic President Jeff Weltman went to visit Isaac before he left, with plans to cheer him up. No need: By then, Weltman said, Isaac was trying to comfort him, not the other way around. \u201cHe was chipper and kind of looking at this as Day 1 of his recovering,\u201d Weltman said. ACL tears can take many months, perhaps even a full year, to recover from in most cases \u2014 and given the timing of this injury, it raises the possibility that Isaac could miss much of the 2020-21 season no matter when it starts. \u201cI hate to use the word crushing, but this is not an easy one to deal with. \u2026 I can\u2019t lie, it\u2019s particularly difficult to handle when it\u2019s someone like him,\u201d Magic coach Steve Clifford said. Isaac was hurt on Jan. 1, suffering a bad sprain and bone bruise and he didn\u2019t play again until the restart at Disney. He wore a large brace to protect the knee, plus had it wrapped \u2014 and still couldn\u2019t avoid another injury. Weltman said doctors told him the brace that Isaac wore might have kept a terrible situation from getting even worse, and that any player who landed the way Isaac did on that play would have likely faced serious injury. He also stressed the January injury had nothing to do with this one. \u201cIt was completely unrelated,\u201d Weltman said. \u201cThere were no structures in the knee that were damaged in the first injury that were impacted in this most recent injury whatsoever. It was completely unrelated. Absolutely, unequivocally, not brought back too early.\u201d The Magic have won five consecutive games, scoring at least 120 points in each, and are battling Brooklyn for the No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference. Orlando plays Indiana on Tuesday, the third of eight games for the Magic in the bubble. Isaac finished the season averaging 11.9 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, 1.6 steals and 1.4 assists \u2014 all career-highs for the third-year forward, who has seen two of those seasons marred by injury issues. He appeared in only 27 games as a rookie, mostly because of problems with his right ankle. He made headlines last week by being the first player during the restart to not kneel for the national anthem, saying he chose to stand because he did not believe the gesture of kneeling and wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt \u2014 as virtually all players and coaches have since games resumed Thursday to call more attention toward the problems of systemic racism and police brutality \u2014 actually equated to helping Black lives. He is also an ordained minister and has been honored by the Magic for his charitable and civic work. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a guy who has just put so much work into getting back in time to join his team here and to see him go through that, to see him experience that, it\u2019s just a gut punch for him,\u201d Weltman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a setback for Jonathan. It\u2019s a setback. We will move forward. We will live to fight another day.\u201d"},{"id":26620,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dennis-schroder-leaves-nba-campus-billy-donovan","date":"2020-08-03","title":"Dennis Schroder leaves NBA campus for family matter","content":" Oklahoma City guard Dennis Schroder has left the NBA campus in Orlando to be with his family for the birth of his second child, coach Billy Donovan confirmed to reporters on Monday. \u201cIt happened this morning, so he\u2019s with his family at this point in time,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chance probably to talk to him and find out a little bit more, if it\u2019s not later today or tomorrow.

Or Tuesday. Wednesday perhaps? The days at Disney all run very Groundhog-ish. You have to check the calendar at sunrise to be sure. The one weekday that many people on the outside always awaited was Friday, especially Casual Fridays, back when people actually went into the office, which sounds very 2019-ish. Here at the NBA campus, every day is Casual Friday. Which means, almost nobody\u2019s in business attire. First of all, the Florida humidity highly discourages anything that buttons to the collar. Plus, the vibe here was set right from the start: Keep things casual. And this policy extends to the NBA people who\u2019d normally be in a suit. That\u2019s the head coaches. And me. The only time coaches ever dress down for an NBA game is during summer league, and since this 2019-20 season is indeed stretching deep into summer \u2014 and speeding toward fall, FYI \u2014 the rule regarding bench attire was relaxed. Therefore, the coaches are all in golf shirts, which seems right for someone like Doc Rivers, since the Clippers\u2019 coach has spent almost all of his free time on Disney\u2019s three golf courses. Rivers is such a golfaholic that he\u2019s only slightly less concerned about how he shoots on the course than how the Clippers shoot in games. The sartorial standard here has been wholeheartedly endorsed by the coaches, who seem relieved to be free of the dress shirts and sport coats and pants that stifle movement. Mike Budenholzer of the Bucks and a few others have mentioned how comfortable they feel and wonder if the suit rule might be optional when the NBA returns to normal.  This is a switch. For years, NBA coaches gravitated to suits, if only because it set them apart from their counterparts in the NFL and Major League Baseball. Can you imagine Pat Riley or Chuck Daly, a pair of Hall of Fame clotheshorses, willingly choosing to dress down? With the heads-up about the casual attire, I dressed smartly for this long trip, packing for a typical Disney World experience rather than a business Disney World experience. Which means I left plenty of social distance between me and my suits. That leaves me with mixed emotions. Being separated from my suit and tie isn\u2019t very different from a player being stripped of his jersey. Me and suits go together like plaids and solids whenever I\u2019m at work, which non-sports reporters surely get a good laugh at, because the assumption is this work is really fun and games. Well, perhaps to an extent in their eyes. Being on the job requires a certain cosmetic standard even if it\u2019s done in a gym, but these aren\u2019t normal times and the NBA reboot isn\u2019t being held under normal conditions. That leaves me sad if only because we\u2019d all love to resume our regular routines. And those suits cost me good money. My arms are long, so most of my suits are tailored, and as much as I might plead my case to Steve Quintana, my otherwise solid supervisor would never entertain any thoughts of giving me a wardrobe allowance, so I\u2019ve never bothered to ask. So the suits stayed home. It\u2019s all about golf shirts and shorts. Every day is Friday at the NBA reboot, where everyone is keeping up by dressing down. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award, the National Basketball Coaches Association announced Monday. The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award recognizes the dedication, commitment and hard work of NBA Head Coaches and is presented annually to a Head Coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court. It honors the spirit of Michael H. Goldberg, the esteemed longtime Executive Director of the NBCA, who set the standard for loyalty, integrity, love of the game, passionate representation and tireless promotion of NBA coaching. It is unique in that it is the only award voted upon by the winners\u2019 peers, the Head Coaches of all 30 NBA teams. This year\u2019s voting was based on games played from the start of the 2019-20 regular season through games played on March 11. The depth of coaching excellence in the NBA is reflected in this year\u2019s voting as 8 Head Coaches received votes. In addition to Budenholzer and Donovan, the following Coaches also received votes: Taylor Jenkins, Nate McMillan, Nick Nurse, Erik Spoelstra, Brad Stevens and Frank Vogel. \u201cCongratulations to Mike Budenholzer and Billy Donovan on this prestigious recognition,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks Head Coach and NBCA President Rick Carlisle. \u201cMike led the Bucks to the best record in the league for a second straight season and Billy became just the fourth active Head Coach to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first five seasons. To win the vote of our peers makes the Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award one of the most meaningful in all of pro sports.\u201d  Coach Budenholzer guided the Bucks to the best record in the NBA (53-12) for the second year in a row. He becomes the first two-time winner of this Award. The Bucks were the NBA\u2019s highest scoring team, averaging 118.6 points per game, and outscored opponents by a league-high average of 11.2 ppg. The 11.2 ppg differential is tied for the fifth largest margin in NBA history. Defensively, Coach Budenholzer\u2019s team held opponents to 107.4 ppg, fifth best in the league. He won Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for December (13-2 record) and February (10-1 record). \u201cFirst, congrats to Billy Donovan for the outstanding job he and his staff have done with the Oklahoma City Thunder,\u201d said Milwaukee Bucks Head Coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cAnother great year of coaching by Billy and, again, another great year of work by all the Head Coaches in the NBA. Thank you all for your vote and support. Thank you to our dedicated players and staff in Milwaukee. The players are special, the staff is special and I\u2019m beyond fortunate to coach this great team and for this great organization. \u201cCelebrating the memory of Michael H. Goldberg and continuing to bring honor to his great legacy of work on behalf of all NBA Coaches gives the Award additional significant meaning. Those of us lucky enough to know and work with Michael know how much he did for the sport and for Coaches. As Michael was a terrific advocate for all of us, may we use our platform to raise awareness and speak out on the need for social justice, equality and inclusiveness in our society.\u201d Coach Donovan led the Thunder to a 40-24 season, tied for fifth in the Western Conference. He joins Rick Carlisle, Erik Spoelstra and Steve Kerr as the only active Head Coaches to guide their teams to the playoffs in each of their first five seasons. From Thanksgiving through March 11, the Thunder went 34-13, the third best record in the NBA during that period. Since the start of December, Donovan\u2019s team went 19-4 on the road, best in the NBA. Donovan coached the Thunder to wins in 16 games in which they trailed entering the fourth quarter. No other team won more than 8 such games. Donovan won Western Conference Coach of the Month for December (11-4 record). \u201cI am honored and humbled to be recognized by the Coaches, they are a great group of people that I admire and respect,\u201d said Oklahoma City Thunder Head Coach Billy Donovan. \u201cReceiving the Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award alongside such a terrific Coach like Bud makes it even more special. Individual honors to me have always been a reflection of good team dynamics, and I\u2019m proud of the collective work that our players, coaching staff and the entire organization has put in this season. I\u2019m looking forward to what\u2019s ahead in Orlando as we get back to basketball and using our platform for social justice.\u201d \u201cI was fortunate to work alongside Michael H. Goldberg during the formative years of my career,\u201d said David Fogel, NBCA Executive Director. \u201cThis year\u2019s winners embody the same high levels of integrity and excellence that Michael displayed every day of his life. Both Coach Budenholzer and Coach Donovan exemplify these values on and off the court, and their tireless work ethic led to accomplished seasons for both the Bucks and Thunder. Congratulations to both Coaches and their staffs. This honor is most deserved.\u201d The NBCA encompasses all current and former NBA Head and Assistant Coaches. In 1980, just four years after the NBCA was founded, Michael H. Goldberg became its first Executive Director. Building on the existing foundation of the NBCA, he guided it during the years of the greatest growth in professional basketball. He helped gain significant benefits for NBA Coaches, including increased retirement funds and disability insurance. Prior to the NBCA, Goldberg was General Counsel of the American Basketball Association. The prior recipients of the Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award are: The NBA will announce the winner of the Red Auerbach Trophy as the NBA\u2019s Coach of the Year during TNT\u2019s coverage of the 2020 NBA Playoffs. About the NBCA: The National Basketball Coaches Association (NBCA) is the labor association that represents basketball coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Weakness against weakness. The Milwaukee Bucks and the Houston Rockets were who we thought they were, showing up warts and all in the restart bubble for a national network audience Sunday night . The Rockets were four warts, er, points better, 120-116 in a clash of styles that demonstrated what each team does best \u2014 and raised questions that will dog them right into the playoffs that begin in two weeks. Think of Houston, what comes to mind? Three-pointers and lots of them, since the Rockets take and make more than any other team in the NBA. Normally that\u2019s about 44 attempts to make 16. This time, they launched 61 and made 21. Those came against, not coincidentally, the team that gives up the most 3-point attempts and 3-point field goals in the league. But that\u2019s who Milwaukee is: a pack-the-paint bunch that all but dares opponents to beat them from the arc. Meanwhile, the Bucks zealously defend the interior, stifling attempts at the rim better than anyone. It\u2019s a formula- slash -gamble on the percentages that typically works, especially across 29 opponents in an 82-game regular season with limited game planning. As the field of foes narrows, it might become more of a vulnerability, considering what happened against Toronto in the East finals last spring when Fred VanVleet got hot. An essential part of the Bucks\u2019 defensive scheme is to get stops without fouling. They ranked fifth in fewest free throws allowed heading into Sunday\u2019s game, showing a discipline that keeps them from beating themselves by giving away freebie points. This time, though, they put the Rockets on the line 31 times for 27 free throws made. James Harden (11-of-13) and Russell Westbrook (10-of-12) alone combined for more than the Bucks typically allow to entire teams. It all left Houston with a 10-point advantage with the clock stopped, more than enough. Against a team that has determinedly gone \u201csmall-in\u201d on centerless basketball \u2013 the Rockets\u2019 tallest starter is 6-foot-7 Robert Covington \u2013 the Bucks were able to flex their size all night. They outrebounded Houston 65-36. They scored 60 points in the paint, while giving up only 20. Presumptive repeat Kia Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo had another efficient night cramming the stats sheet (36 point, 18 rebounds, eight assists in 33 minutes). Meanwhile, the biggest man on the floor, center Brook Lopez, dominated inside with 23 points and 12 boards. And yet, the Rockets\u2019 shorter, quicker lineup wreaked havoc on the Bucks\u2019 ball protection. Twenty-three turnovers were way too many, good for 30 of the Rockets\u2019 points. They didn\u2019t always show Antetokounmpo numbers of defenders as he bore down on them, but they did it enough. They bothered Middleton into six turnovers, matching his season-high. Both teams were playing shy one Eric \u2013 Gordon for the Rockets, Bledsoe for the Bucks. Gordon is out two weeks with a left ankle sprain, while Bledsoe is working himself back from a positive case of coronavirus. Gordon would have liked to launch some of those 3-pointers, but Bledsoe was missed more by his team, especially as a disruptor on defense. The clash of two MVPs \u2013 Greek Freak vs. The Beard \u2013 never quite materialized with Harden shooting poorly and idling through part of the game. But he had seven rebounds and seven assists to go with his 24 points. That left opportunities from the arc for Daniel House, Robert Covington, P.J. Tucker and Jeff Green, the latter two taking advantage of Lopez repeatedly leaving them open in the corners. What did live up to its billing was the glimpse of both the Rockets and the Bucks in full. They did well what they do better than most, while coping with flaws that were exposed at both ends of the floor. It didn\u2019t mean much in what probably was the last game they\u2019ll play against each other this year. But it meant plenty for what each of them will try to do, and hide, as they make their way through their respective conferences. The Bucks and the Rockets might have the most pressure to advance, East and West, of any of the 16 eventual playoff teams. Both look formidable. Both look vulnerable \u2014 the Bucks a little more so, Sunday night. *.* * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 Going shopping was a top priority for Taylor Jenkins when he was first hired as coach of the Memphis Grizzlies. The man needed suits. NBA sidelines tend to look like fashion runways these days, with coaches in tailored suits, sharp ties and polished dress shoes, so Jenkins went out and bought appropriately for his first chance at being a head coach. But at the restart of the season at Walt Disney World, the dress code has been relaxed to allow polos, slacks, even sneakers \u2014 and coaches are thankful. Jenkins is among them, though he notes that spending spree doesn\u2019t help him much now. \u201cI spent quite a bit of money picking out my wardrobe, first-time head coach, so I\u2019ve invested quite a bit there to quote-unquote look good on the sidelines,\u201d Jenkins said. At least he\u2019ll be saving on dry cleaning for the foreseeable future. By league rule, male \u201ccoaches and assistant coaches must wear a sport coat or suit coat\u201d during games. That rule, however, was ditched for the restart, where there are no fans in the stands and games are played at the Walt Disney World resort near Orlando \u2014 where midday temperatures exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.22 degrees Celsius) are not uncommon at this time of year. Coaches are mixing it up: short-sleeved polos, long-sleeved polos, some in team colors, some in bright colors. When Toronto beat the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night, Raptors coach Nick Nurse was wearing a thin hoodie with a message printed on the front encouraging people to vote. \u201cI love it,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cI hope that someday we adopt these dress code rules. Although I look very good in a suit and tie, I will admit, I\u2019m also very, very comfortable wearing a Nuggets polo and a pair of TravisMathew athletic leisure wear pants. I think I\u2019ve done a very good job with the look.\u201d The looks for football coaches is all over the map; some over the years have worn coats and ties, while New England\u2019s Bill Belichick seems most comfortable in a hoodie with the sleeves mostly cut off. Baseball managers are in uniforms \u2014 the pants, anyway; not all wear jerseys. In the NBA, the dress code got ramped up considerably thanks to Miami Heat president Pat Riley and the late Chuck Daly. Riley, when he coached, roamed the sideline in snazzy Armani; Daly\u2019s suits were Hugo Boss, and his shoes were so good that his friends coveted them. After Daly died, Rollie Massimino raided his friend\u2019s shoe collection and wore them for the remainder of his own coaching career. Riley is still among the sharpest of dressers, and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is not afraid to follow in those footsteps with his own wardrobe. But for this trip, Spoelstra didn\u2019t pack a single tie. He\u2019s not afraid to say that he wouldn\u2019t mind if this became a permanent switch. \u201cIt takes a little bit more thought when you have to wear suits,\u201d said Spoelstra, who is coaching at Disney in black shirts, black slacks, black dress socks and upscale black sneakers. \u201cI can speak for our coaching staff \u2014 we\u2019ve enjoyed it.\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers didn\u2019t bring any suits but said after a scrimmage at Disney last month that he\u2019d wear one if and only if his team was in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Boston coach Brad Stevens has even skipped wearing ties in regular circumstances, so he wouldn\u2019t figure to have an issue with the polos-and-khakis look. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we still wear suits,\u201d San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said last summer, when he was coaching USA Basketball\u2019s team at the World Cup in China. \u201cSomebody, please, tell me why we do that.\u201d Popovich wore polos, sneakers and sweats to coach in that tournament and raved about the comfort level. He repeated the refrain a few times earlier this season, and the Disney dress code is right in line with what he\u2019d like to see happen when \u201cnormalcy\u201d returns. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan, when he was coaching the Florida Gators, was mandated to arrive in a suit and tie. The suit jacket, however, rarely was still on for tipoff \u2014 and, as one might expect, he\u2019s part of the chorus of coaches raving about needing to wear only polos these days. \u201cAsk all coaches,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re dressing in is pretty comfortable.\u201d"},{"id":26661,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/international-players-racial-injustice","date":"2020-08-02","title":"International players offer global view on push for racial justice","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The phone calls reach the U.S. from all across the globe. Spain and Slovenia, Australia and Serbia, Turkey and France. The people dialing the number use different country codes and speak different tongues yet all seem to ask the same question to their NBA player on the other end: Do Black lives really not matter much in America? Friends and family members of these players from the homeland are all curious. They get CNN. They watch the protests, see the anger, read about the incidents involving people of color and so they reach out to the only link they have on U.S. soil to get the 4-1-1. And that link is someone who talks with Black teammates and coaches on a daily basis, goes to basketball battle with them on game nights and eats and socializes with them away from the court. Surely then, they know. But: Those NBA players from other countries don\u2019t have easy answers either, because they\u2019re from other worlds. \u201cIt \u2019 s different,\u201d said Bogdan Bogdanovich of the Kings, a rising talent from Serbia. \u201c W here I come from, we don \u2019 t have racial issues. It was a different way of growing up for me. In my country, we never feel this way.\u201d There is understandable angst simmering within a basketball league that\u2019s more than 75 percent Black, the largest concentration of Black athletes of all the major professional sports. Many were born and raised in American communities that dealt with poverty partly caused by systemic racism and among residents who routinely come in contact with police. While these wealthy players rarely if ever feel any outright racism in their privileged and famous adult lives, they have friends or family members who don\u2019t enjoy that advantage. That\u2019s why the players, with the cooperation of the NBA, felt it necessary to make social justice a major part of this NBA reboot. There\u2019s a unified spirit among all to make statements nightly, even among white players and coaches. But there\u2019s also a unique segment of the NBA community that\u2019s caught in a perplexing predicament. Players from faraway lands don\u2019t share the same life experiences, at least not enough to make a strong connection with the movement of the moment. This is all new, or perhaps to use a more appropriate word, foreign to the foreigners. \u201cIf it\u2019s a foreign player who\u2019s white, I guarantee you they see the difference more clearly because they don\u2019t have the denial in them,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. \u201cThey don\u2019t come here with slavery. They come here from a country that was probably less racist, and once they\u2019re here, they\u2019re like, `Wow, I can\u2019t believe this (bleep).\u2019 I hear it all the time.\u201d Because of America\u2019s diversity, there\u2019s more chance of a clashing of cultures and religions and race than in places where most international players were born and raised. While those societies are homogeneous and therefore don\u2019t reap as many cultural benefits, they also don\u2019t suffer from as many social ills. It makes for an interesting introduction to America for players who began migrating to the NBA for their pro careers in substantial numbers starting in the previous decade. \u201cI grew up in Belgium,\u201d said Nikola Vucevic, starting center for the Magic, \u201cand my best friends in school was one African kid and one from Asia. I played college (at USC) with people of all races around me and I never looked at them differently. Your race doesn\u2019t matter who you are as a person; we\u2019re all equal. But I did notice when I came here in America how people speak about it differently.\u201d Bogdanovic began his professional career with his hometown team in Belgrade. A smattering of Black players from the U.S. were on Serbian rosters and Bogdanovic never saw any issues. \u201cAll the American players who come to my country and play, they are more than welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of nice memories. Our culture is different, more family oriented, and they like that and they always want to come back.\u201d There are exceptions among the foreign NBA flock. Giannis Antetokounmpo mentions how his parents, Nigerian immigrants, had issues once the family settled in Greece. Same for Patty Mills; his mother was the daughter of a white man and Aboriginal woman and therefore was part of the Stolen Generations, where mixed-race children were removed from their families by the Australian government. Mostly, though, international NBA players outside Africa are white and largely oblivious to racial issues. Any strife in their countries mainly stemmed from religious or governmental reasons. There were ethnic and religious tensions in Slovenia before Heat guard Goran Dragic was born in 1986; five years later the Ten Day War happened as a result of Slovenia\u2019s independence from the former Yugoslavia. But Dragic was too young to remember the impact on the lives of him and his family. \u201cIt was crazy even to this day,\u201d he said, \u201cwith my dad saying I was going to school with friends who were Muslim and Christian Orthodox and they were best friends, and suddenly when war broke out, they couldn\u2019t hang out together anymore. It\u2019s not something you would ever imagine.\u201d The most visible international player who wears scars of conflict is Enes Kanter, whose estrangement from Turkey is more government related; he has lashed out against the current regime, which he believes is corrupt and guilty of human rights abuses, and as a result has been persona non grata. \u201cWhen I was growing up I remember people really didn\u2019t respect each other, different cultures, religions and colors,\u201d he said. \u201cEven back then I knew something was wrong. I came to America at 17 and I didn\u2019t know all the stuff going on here, too.\u201d Kanter said his treatment in America is better than what he now receives in Turkey. But he connects with the plight of the underserved here.  \u201cEvery team I\u2019ve been on we always respected each other and obviously we came from different backgrounds, religions and cultures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we left our differences in the locker room and spoke one language in basketball. That made us better friends and teammates.\u201d Kanter is curious by nature and studious by heart and with each racial incident in America during his NBA career, which began in 2011, he took it upon himself to study. \u201cI started to pay attention more about social justice in America,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the things I heard from my teammates was heartbreaking. We need to leave our differences on the table. We only have one world to live in. We need to make this world better together. When I was with the Jazz, I remember being in my hotel room and seeing these books in the desks, and so I started reading the Bible and Book of Mormon so I could have a better conversation with fans.\u201d When demonstrations began to multiply after the death of George Floyd, Kanter drove 20 hours from his temporary home in Chicago to Boston to join his Celtics teammates in protests. \u201cI had to be with my brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what it is to fight for freedom and justice because of what happened to me. I told my teammates it\u2019s not about white and Black. It\u2019s about everybody vs. racism. We have only one enemy and we need to stay together and go out there and fight. At the protest I saw white, Black, hispanic and Asian. It\u2019s not just one race\u2019s fight, it\u2019s our fight. That gave me so much hope. All together fighting. Kids are seeing people stepping up. It will inspire them.\u201d Vucevic said he\u2019s educating himself on American history and lately has taken special interest in African-American history by watching documentaries on the Civil Rights movement and its leaders. \u201cAs a white person I can educate myself to see how we can try to bring positive change,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned how John Lewis put his life on the line to fight for change, and he did that at a very difficult time. This is a great time to bring change, with everyone getting involved around the world, not only here.\u201d Dragic took his education from the Heat\u2019s most vocal teammates, Jimmy Butler and Udonis Haslem, when the players held a meeting about social justice before the restart. \u201cI told them I\u2019m here for you, I support everything you do, whatever you need from me I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d said Dragic. \u201cI feel bad for them and feel bad for myself because I\u2019m white privilege. \u201cBut I also feel good about the fact we\u2019ve had demonstrations back home, all over the world, London, New Zealand, Europe, and that\u2019s the way it should be because at the end of the day everybody is a human being with rights.\u201d And Bogdanovic saw the effect it had on his teammates during a players meeting with the Kings. \u201cWhen you see your close friends react that way, it \u2019 s serious,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the emotions. I think the NBA did a really good job to address the issue. The NBA is a global sport and that \u2019 s good because it\u2019s a global problem. Thanks for the NBA for giving an opportunity for international players to address social justice on a global platform.\u201d So there\u2019s a story to be told to those back home in Europe and Asia and Australia about the sights and sounds and feelings in America and the NBA. The international players have joined the cause in spite of their lack of exposure to racism, and most are wearing jerseys emblazoned with social justice messages. Luka Doncic is wearing Enakopravnost which is Slovenian for equality; likewise, Mavericks teammate JJ Barea has Igualdad , the Spanish version, and Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic is bringing Ravnopravnost, the Bosnian version. Dragic also chose \u201cEquality\u201d but with a twist. \u201cThey asked me if I\u2019m going to do it in my own language and I said no, because if I put it in Slovenian, only two million people would understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are such a small country. I said put it in English so a lot of people will understand.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

How could it with the likes of Bam Adebayo serving as the conduit for the Heat\u2019s resurgence this season and Nikola Jokic as the epicenter of all things for the Nuggets? Two super-skilled All-Star big men, each one of them the fulcrum for their team\u2019s hopes of disrupting the order of things come playoff time. It sounds like a script from a bygone era. But it\u2019s very much a reality in this case. Jokic, the craftiest passing big man in the league, was the first-team All-NBA center last season, the foundational player the Nuggets have crafted their team around. Adebayo, one of the favorites for the Most Improved Player Award, has turned into an All-Star in his third season while also blossoming into one of the best defensive players in the league. Only four players in the league are averaging at least 15 points, 10 rebounds and five assists this season. Adebayo, Jokic, reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and Indiana\u2019s All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis. So it\u2019s not hard to see why Adebayo and Jokic are the linchpins to the season restart for their teams on the Orlando campus. The Heat occupy that space behind Milwaukee and around both Toronto and Boston in the Eastern Conference\u2019s upper crust, while the Nuggets have been lurking in the shadows of the two Los Angeles powers in the West. Saturday\u2019s restart opener for both teams, a 125-105 Heat blowout win over a Nuggets team that played without three starters (Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and Will Barton), offered an intriguing glimpse at the problems both Adebayo and Jokic can cause in future matchups against teams not nearly as skilled, talented or versatile at their position. Adebayo finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and six assists, controlling the action inside on both ends while the Heat shot nearly 45 percent (13-for-29) from beyond the 3-point line and pulled away late. His rise couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for a Heat team in transition from the Dwyane Wade era. When Jimmy Butler chose Miami last summer in free agency (the deal ended up being a sign-and-trade with Philadelphia), he needed an All-Star counterpart if the Heat were going to be a factor in the revamped East. It wasn\u2019t clear until this season, Adebayo\u2019s first as a full-time starter, that his game was as polished and effective on both ends. More than just a physical specimen with an extra gear, he showed off the ability to dribble the ball up the floor and initiate offensive sets if needed while also anchoring the Heat defense. He\u2019s yet another member of an increasingly impressive crop of players from the 2017 Draft class \u2014 including Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart and Dillon Brooks \u2014 who have already outplayed their draft slots. That was on full display Saturday in his matchup with Jokic, another underhanded draft pick made good. Jokic shot 7-for-16 from the floor and finished with 19 points, seven rebounds, six assists, a block and a steal in his first regular season game action in over four months. But don\u2019t let this one game fool you. The Nuggets weren\u2019t at full strength and are still working young players into the rotation for the first time. Jokic is the generator that regularly powers the Nuggets\u2019 top 10 offense, joining Giannis as one of only two players in the league to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists. The restart has provided even more weapons for Nuggets coach Mike Malone to work with in Michael Porter Jr., who started Saturday\u2019s game, and rookie 7-footer Bol Bol. If their development goes anything like Jokic\u2019s did in his first four seasons in the Rocky Mountains, from second rounder to face of the franchise, this crew could be scary in the near future. The Nuggets can already deploy frontcourt size, length and athleticism \u2014 veterans Paul Millsap, Mason Plumlee, Jerami Grant and Noah Vonleh included \u2014 to match up favorably with any team in the league, including the vaunted Lakers and Clippers. It\u2019s the seasoning where the Nuggets come up a bit short. Jokic has only played 14 career playoff games, all last season in the Nuggets\u2019 run to Game 7 of the conference semifinals (a game they lost on their home floor to Portland). So just like with Adebayo, who has only played in five playoff games in his career, there is still much to show and prove. But make no mistake: they are centerpieces for challengers, relics of an old style eager for the restart and whatever comes next. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

At the top of the list, obviously, is underwear. As long as we humans inherit this earth, nothing will ever take precedent over wearing boxers or briefs, or so I thought. This being the year 2020 and the age of coronavirus, suddenly the mask is rising up the charts faster than Drake or Taylor Swift. Speaking of her last name, it\u2019s amazing how swiftly the mask \u2014 an accessory that was once only mass-produced every October \u2014 became a necessary part of the wardrobe. Six months ago, nobody I knew even owned a mask. But now? Folks have more masks than underwear. Yes, it\u2019s true that some people still refuse to wear a mask even as a virus rages, and I suspect those are the same people who leave the house without underwear. That\u2019s how silly and misguided they are. And please, stop saying mask-on, mask-off is a political choice. I\u2019ve seen plenty of folks in my neighborhood that I know lean left who don\u2019t do the right thing, either. Thankfully, here on the NBA campus in Orlando, it\u2019s mandatory to wear a mask (underwear optional, but keep that to yourself). I was gently reprimanded on Thursday by the Mask Police when I allowed my mask to slip below my chin while watching Clippers-Lakers. In a panic, I realized my mistake and then pointed to an empty bag of chips, and breathed a sigh of relief when the Policewoman said: \u201cI know. People eat and then forget. Happens all the time.\u201d I came to the restart in Orlando with a handful of masks, which wasn\u2019t necessary. The NBA has plenty. In fact, there are boxes and boxes of NBA-printed masks everywhere you go, in case for some reason you left your room and forgot (and really, how can you?). This of course presents a major problem every morning when you rise and scratch your head and ask: Which mask to wear?  Yes, there are tough life decisions we\u2019re commonly confronted with, and now this. Should the chosen mask match with the rest of that day\u2019s outfit? Should it be the one that fits the most comfortable? What about the Steelers mask made for me by a relative in Pittsburgh; should I show allegiance to the black and gold? Or maybe show gratitude to the NBA and wear one of theirs? My most used mask is a standard white one. I\u2019m not even sure where I got it, and I have three of them. When the pandemic hit, I suspect I went on a frantic mask-hunt like millions of other folks. Understand that back in March, nobody knew where to get masks. Mask Depot? Masks-R-Us? McMasks? Out of nowhere, an industry quickly mushroomed and masks were for sale everywhere. A vendor who once sold T-shirts from a kiosk in a mall near my house was suddenly in the mask business. So the mystery of where the white mask originated will remain unsolved. Doesn\u2019t really matter, anyway. I am well-stocked with masks and the NBA will see to that. Players, coaches, testers, everyone here leaves their hotel room with a shared piece of attire. Our underwear choices, however, are different. I\u2019m assuming. I\u2019m not actually checking. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

It is the only real suspense for the next few weeks as the NBA sifts through the seeded games portion of the restart to learn who wants LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the first round. One team, the Pelicans, is bringing a maybe-sorta-kinda approach. As competitors, yes of course, the Pelicans want the playoffs. As protectors of their investment by allowing Zion Williamson to play catch-up on his conditioning program, the Pelicans are placing a higher value on the future. Another team, the Grizzlies, currently hold that eighth spot but with a tough schedule ahead, their grip is more tenuous today. That\u2019s because they dropped their reboot opener, and not just to any team but perhaps their biggest threat. That\u2019s the Trail Blazers, now revamped after adding a few missing pieces and certainly refreshed after grinding out an overtime win Friday over the Grizzlies and planting the seed of concern in Memphis. Momentum and fate have a wicked way of shifting on a whim, and so nothing will be settled anytime soon. Especially not this weekend. Still, there\u2019s little on the line right now for the Bucks or Clippers or Lakers or the 12 other teams currently holding playoff spots. Meanwhile, the drama is mainly confined realistically to three teams, perhaps four if you believe in the Kings, all making their case for making a few months spent on lockdown at Disney World seem worthwhile. Plenty of intensity and urgency was compressed into 53 minutes when the Blazers and Grizzlies engaged in a competitive and at times chippy game. There were four technical fouls called for taunting and trash talking because, without fans, the refs can hear everything now. But more than anything, the two teams knew what was at stake. The Blazers won because this wasn\u2019t your pre-pandemic Blazers team. They\u2019ve since added size with center Jusuf Nurkic and power forward Zach Collins joining a starting lineup that added newcomer Carmelo Anthony last winter. Nurkic played an official game for the first time in 16 months after a gruesome leg injury, and Collins since October after a shoulder injury. Both big men had moments, yet it was \u2018Melo hitting a pair of late 3-pointers in regulation to give the new and improved Blazers an opportunity to triumph in OT. \u201cWe let our experience take over down the stretch,\u201d said Damian Lillard. \u201cOnce it came down to it, I think we showed we were also the team that wanted it more.\u201d Nurkic revealed that his grandmother is battling COVID-19 and devoted the game to her, saying he\u2019s carried that burden since arriving in Orlando. Lillard said: \u201cThe fact that he was able to still show up and get his work done it shows how much it means to him, with everything he has going on with his family back home. To keep his mind with the team in spite of everything wearing him down makes it more impressive. Good to see him back.\u201d The Blazers began the game behind the eight (spot) ball. They need to either be within four games of the Grizzlies to force a mini-play-in game for the playoff spot, if they can\u2019t overtake Memphis outright by late next week. \u201cWe need as many wins as possible,\u201d said CJ McCollum, who led the Blazers with 33 points. The Grizzlies\u2019 lead is now 2 1\/2 games over the Blazers, and they have a rigid schedule ahead. Their margin for error is larger than their pursuers, but any skid could allow panic to set in on a scrappy but young team. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it a game at a time,\u201d said Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to ride the highs and lows of whatever comes our way. One game, one loss isn\u2019t going to dictate anything. We\u2019re just gonna play and take it from there.\u201d Meanwhile, the Pelicans are in a bind. They must temper any urge to go heavy with Williamson\u2019s minutes, which obviously has a negative side effect. Less Williamson means less of a chance to make a serious bid for eighth. Pelicans president David Griffin went through the unusual step of addressing the media Friday specifically about Zion, who played only 15 minutes Thursday in a two-point loss to Utah and was the best player on the floor in that span. Griffin said because Williamson missed 13 days of practice to tend to a family matter, he fell behind the pace set by the team\u2019s performance and conditioning staff, which placed every player on a specific schedule. Zion must therefore \u201cramp up\u201d before he can play extended minutes, and unfortunately with the start of the seeded games, the amount of practice time has dwindled. \u201cOur performance team had a very clear plan laid out,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThat plan included scrimmage minutes. Zion didn\u2019t get that opportunity. He was called away. He\u2019s 13 days removed from the group in terms of following that plan, and this is after not playing basketball after four months. \u201cEveryone wants him to play 40 minutes and I can promise you he\u2019s not going to. It\u2019s not complicated. He will not play significant minutes in the next game and may not the following game. He didn\u2019t get the benefits that his teammates got for those 13 days.\u201d Griffin said he understands the precarious nature of the chase for the eighth spot, with only seven games left and almost no margin for error. \u201cHe\u2019s Zion,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe league office takes as much interest as the fans. I\u2019m just frustrated that there has to be a conspiracy theory involved when there hasn\u2019t been one thing done different with him than it would for every player on this roster. \u201cBut because the stakes are raised and unfortunately we were selected for seven national TV games, we\u2019re supposed to reinvent the wheel. It\u2019s not fair to the kid and so on his behalf I\u2019m frustrated for sure. We\u2019re trying to navigate a difficult situation.\u201d With the Pelicans facing stiff competition for eighth place, they may not have the benefit of time. This isn\u2019t November. This is the 2019-20 restart, where every game counts as the calendar flips to August, of all months. Eighth place is on the line. The playoffs await the winner.

(AP) \u2014 Jonathan Isaac stood, and stood out. And later Friday, Gregg Popovich and Becky Hammon did the same. Most players and coaches, but not all, are kneeling while pre-recorded versions of the national anthem are being played at the restarted NBA season. Isaac became the first player to not kneel when he stood before he and the Orlando Magic played the Brooklyn Nets. In a later game, Popovich \u2014 a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, and coach of USA Basketball\u2019s national team in addition to his longtime duties as head coach in San Antonio \u2014 stood with his arms at his sides before the Spurs played Sacramento. Hammon, one of Popovich\u2019s assistant coaches, also stood. She draped one arm over the shoulders of Spurs assistant Will Hardy, kneeling to her right, and the other over veteran San Antonio guard Patty Mills, kneeling to her left. Popovich and Hammon both wore \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d T-shirts, as almost all players and coaches have for warm-ups and the anthem. Isaac did not wear the shirt. He wore his white Orlando jersey instead, standing with his hands behind his back, the ordained minister praying silently as the song played. \u201cKneeling while wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt doesn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with supporting Black lives,\u201d Isaac said. Isaac\u2019s decision was not a surprise to his teammates; he revealed it in a team meeting earlier in the week. \u201cThat\u2019s a personal decision,\u201d Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \u201cWe\u2019re all supporting each other in this. And if guys are not comfortable kneeling and they want to stand, nobody has a problem with that. I support him. His teammates support him. The organization supports him. That\u2019s part of living in our country.\u201d Isaac has a history of being active with various charities and churches. \u201cWe all support him,\u201d Magic guard Evan Fournier said. Players and teams at the restart at Disney have elected to kneel for the playing of the anthems, doing so along the sideline nearest their benches \u2014 which also happens to be the one where \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d has been painted onto the playing surface. Popovich, who often speaks out on political and racial matters, has been vocal in recent weeks about the opportunity that the platform of the NBA restart at Walt Disney World provides. Television ratings for the first two games Thursday night were massive; Turner Sports, which aired the doubleheader on TNT, said the average of 3.4 million total viewers \u201cmore than doubled the network\u2019s average viewership\u201d for regular season games. Popovich has said these games, and the eyeballs that will be on them, provides \u201ca tremendous opportunity\u201d to spark change. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a very long time to get this momentum going,\u201d Popovich said in a video that is airing before games and will continue to be shown through Sunday. \u201cAnd it cannot be lost.\u201d Isaac, in his first game since January because of a knee injury, played well. He had 16 points on 6-for-7 shooting in 16 minutes, helping the Magic to a 128-118 victory. \u201cI don\u2019t think that kneeling or putting on a T-shirt, for me personally, is the answer,\u201d Isaac said. The NBA has had a rule since the early 1980s saying players must stand for the anthem. But Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday night, when players from New Orleans, Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers all knelt for the anthem, that he was relaxing that policy in these times when a desire for equality and social justice is at the forefront of many conversations in this country. \u201cListen, the national anthem means different things to different people,\u201d TNT analyst Charles Barkley said in televised comments Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m glad these guys are all unified. But if people don\u2019t kneel, they\u2019re not a bad person. I want to make that perfectly clear. \u2026 He should not be vilified.\u201d The National Basketball Players Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Isaac\u2019s decision. Isaac received the Magic\u2019s community service award last year. He has donated money to feed children affected by the coronavirus pandemic, led a Hurricane Dorian relief effort and has raised money to help organizations promote literacy for children in Central Florida. \u201cWe all sin and the answers to all of the world\u2019s problems, not only racism, is the true Gospel of Jesus Christ,\u201d Isaac said."},{"id":26722,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blazers-gearing-season-restart","date":"2020-07-31","title":"Healthier Blazers can't wait to get rolling in restart","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The two teams that reached the 2019 Western Conference finals certainly have a story to tell, you think? In swift fashion, each imploded because fate was not in their favor. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson suffered major injuries in The Finals, then Durant bounced to the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent. A month into the 2019-20 season, Stephen Curry suffered a hand injury and missed most of this season. The Warriors didn\u2019t make the cut for the NBA season restart in Orlando. The other team from that series, Portland, has its own story. Jusuf Nurkic was slow to mend from a broken leg from a year ago. Fellow big man Zach Collins needed shoulder injury after the third game of this season, and the Blazers gradually went south in the standings, sitting at 29-37, just off the playoff cut line. But Portland is at Walt Disney World to play out the restarted season. And fate fell their way once the season went on hiatus in March due to the coronavirus, allowing the Blazers to heal, retool and reposition themselves for an unlikely comeback. Nurkic is healthy. Collins is healthy. The team\u2019s two surprisingly effective additions, Hassan Whiteside and Carmelo Anthony, are motivated to reclaim their wayward careers. Something\u2019s percolating in Portland other than java. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good spot right now,\u201d said All-Star guard Damian Lillard. In a sense they are. The reality is a bit more complicated. The Blazers sit 3 1\/2 games behind Memphis for the eighth and final playoff spot. Should the Blazers finish within four games of the Grizzlies, they\u2019ll force the best-of-two play-in tournament . The Grizzlies have a tough run in their seeding-game schedule, which begins curiously with the Blazers on Friday ( 4 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). An argument could be made that Portland, more than any of the 21 other teams in Orlando, has the largest upside here. The Blazers haven\u2019t been complete all season because of injuries and late additions. They actually won\u2019t be whole for the restart because veteran swingman Trevor Ariza is sitting this out for family reasons. Their restart rotation will be the best they\u2019ve had all season and perhaps even more potent than last season\u2019s West finals team (because Nurkic was sitting on the bench then and Anthony was sitting at home). As the unquestioned leader and force on the Blazers, Lillard\u2019s optimism is barely concealed. He did heavy lifting all season, averaging a career-high 28.9 points and putting his name on the Kia MVP ballot. The Blazers couldn\u2019t gain any traction in the standings, though, because of the missing and moving parts. Their playoff chances appeared remote when March approached. And then the pandemic changed everything. The four-month layoff not only gave Nurkic and Collins additional time to heal, gain strength and resume practicing, but Anthony shed almost 20 pounds. Few if any teams took advantage of the interruption better than Portland. Their \u201cproblems\u201d are good ones: Coach Terry Stotts must devise a plan to use Nurkic, Collins and Whiteside in a cohesive way. All three are starting material and diverse in their talent, but might not play very long at the same time. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m keeping an open mind about it,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cIt could be the matchups against the team we\u2019re playing that night, I don\u2019t know. I will say (Nurkc and Collins) have both looked the way I remembered them.\u201d Nurkic made great gains as a flexible and dangerous low-post center, averaging 15.6 points and 10.4 rebounds before breaking his left leg horrifically in March of 2019. His soft touch around the rim, appetite for rebounds and nimble footwork lent more front-line balance on a team that relied too heavily on the gifted-yet-overworked Lillard-CJ McCollum backcourt. The double-blow came when Collins, a new starter, needed surgery on his torn left labrum in early November. The damage on the court was almost instant as even before this hiatus Portland was one of the NBA\u2019s weakest rebounding teams. The absence of Nurkic and Collins meant the Blazers often faltered in pick-and-roll situations involving Lillard and McCollum.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019re better with Nurk and Zack healthy,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cIt was a long road back for Nurk, especially, but having him back makes us a better team. He\u2019s a valuable part. We missed him during the season and glad he\u2019s back and healthy.\u201d And now, the lineup juggling begins. How do you field a pair of seven-footers (Nurkic and Whiteside) and a 6-foot-11 post player (Collins)? In place of Nurkic, the Blazers acquired Whiteside, who is the NBA\u2019s top shot blocker and No. 2 rebounder. The Blazers will rotate the three of them for the two front-line power spots, with Anthony at small forward. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to look for each other. We\u2019ll have a lot of high-low situations and all of us are good passers. If we communicate, it could be really lethal.\u201d Whiteside is the only one of the three whose minutes are all but directed at the center because of his limited outside shooting. The Blazers also suspect many teams will go small against them and force matchup issues, although Nurkic believes that\u2019ll be a mistake. \u201c Those people have to guard us, too,\u201d he said. \u201cPick your poison. We\u2019re going to be able to guard anybody out there.\u201d Nurkic admitted to moments of frustration during a rehab that lasted 16 months, although he\u2019s encouraged by his movement and fitness level. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back, to get that feeling, there are no words, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel in great shape. It\u2019s been really a journey for myself. It was good to get 100% with my body, coming back from an injury, I\u2019m just so grateful. I\u2019m really excited and can\u2019t wait. Mostly I\u2019m going to play forward with Whiteside but we\u2019ll mix it with Zach. We\u2019re going to help each other. We all feel really comfortable.\u201d Collins, the Blazers\u2019 best front-line defender, had a shorter recovery yet feels a similar level of anxiousness. \u201cIt was a tough moment, especially my first year starting in the NBA,\u201d Collins said. \u201cTo get that taken away from me, as a young guy, it was really frustrating. Once I figured out (rehab) was going to be that long, I came to accept how long I was going to be out and try to be positive about it. I\u2019ve never been out that long with an injury. Spent a lot of hours in the weight room and time away from the team and being disconnected. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a star in my role, either coming off the bench or starting. If me coming off the bench helps us win a championship, then I\u2019m 100% in.\u201d First things first: Portland isn\u2019t even in the playoffs. But that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the West isn\u2019t aware of the Blazers and their potential. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great practices, able to execute our offense better than we have all season,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve added some things that suits our team better with Zach and Nurk back. We will be very well prepared. We\u2019re ready to play.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The first basket since March 11 was scored by Rudy Gobert, an inescapable coincidence since Gobert\u2019s positive test for the coronavirus caused the NBA to shut down on that date. Gobert\u2019s jersey features the word \u201cEquality\u201d on its back, a social justice message now allowed by the league. When the NBA resumed play Thursday, other changes were also vibrantly noticeable. The 2019-20 season moved to a pair of compact gyms on Walt Disney World property. Along with Gobert, the majority of players wore social justice messages stitched on the back of their jerseys, a reflection of a collective concern for a national uptick in racial incidents. Players and coaches for the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts, locked arms and knelt in solidarity during the national anthem and were joined by the three referees. The same scene played out hours later when the Lakers and Clippers resumed their crosstown rivalry 2,500 miles away from Los Angeles. That was the start. The finish was just as dramatic. Shortly after midnight Eastern time, LeBron James locked up Kawhi Leonard and Paul George while hitting the eventual game-winning basket in the Lakers\u2019 comeback victory. And so: A pair of two-point reopening night thrillers was only the appetizer; there\u2019s now basketball tomorrow and next week and the next two months, science willing. \u201cBasketball is back,\u201d said George. \u201cFans wanted it, we wanted it.\u201d Yes, but basketball returned only on certain, inflexible terms: No fans were allowed of course, daily Covid-19 testing on the restricted Disney campus to ensure protection for all, and players could voice and display their social justice messages. The early reviews are extremely positive and encouraging for an experiment projected to last until mid-October. No player has tested positive since the Disney campus opened three weeks ago. And Silver, the NBA Commissioner, eagerly and understandably made a concession to an NBA rule that normally would restrict a manner of protest. \u201cI respect our teams\u2019 unified act of peaceful protest for social justice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd under these unique circumstances will not enforce our long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our national anthem.\u201d The cosmetics are getting retouched, too. Players who choose social messages will have those words stitched above the numbers; those who stick with their normal names have them below the numbers. Also, the coaching staffs are not required to wear suits and many will go with polo shirts. The creative ways the NBA is trying to replicate an atmosphere were unveiled for the re-opening games, and inside the arena felt very Playstation-like. Video boards surrounded the court on three sides and fans \u201cattended\u201d while being superimposed in 4K. Whenever the \u201croad team\u201d Clippers went to the free-throw line, fans waved. Lawrence Tantor, the long-time Laker public address announcer, pre-recorded the player intros for the \u201chome team\u201d Lakers. But technology can only do so much. Without 18,000 strong inside the building, the genuine sounds of a basketball game, normally muffled by crowd noise, came to life. Coaches shouting instructions were heard clearly. Players on the floor talked trash; Kawhi telling LeBron he got \u201call ball.\u201d Same for players on the bench; when George drew a foul from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Patrick Beverley jumped from his chair and screamed: \u201cHe cannot guard you,\u201d a message perhaps intended more for KCP than George. Both Los Angeles teams are now battling to be kings of Orlando, a curious civic switch made necessary by coronavirus. Before the season reboot, the Clippers owned the head-to-head record but that\u2019s now tied 2-2 and LeBron and friends just put more distance between themselves and the second-place Clippers in the West standings. Since there\u2019s no advantage from a home-court standpoint, the pecking order in either conference carries little weight other than strategical matchups. Therefore, the latest version of Lakers-Clippers was strictly for show, nothing more, until they possibly meet again in the next several weeks for higher stakes. LeBron\u2019s re-debut was memorable for his work on both ends. His basket with 12.8 seconds left capped a rally from 11 points down. He made the game-saving defensive stop on George at the buzzer. He also prevented Kawhi from releasing a shot on consecutive late-game possessions. LeBron\u2019s late-game heroics, along with 34 points from Anthony Davis, were too much for a Clippers\u2019 team missing twin bench terrors Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, one in quarantine, the other tending to family matters. \u201cI\u2019m only worried about one team,\u201d said Davis, \u201cand that\u2019s the Lakers.\u201d The game with the heavier meaning Thursday was Pelicans-Jazz with the burden squarely on New Orleans because the Pelicans are fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. And here\u2019s what we can deduce after Thursday\u2019s game, a two-point Utah win: New Orleans is putting a higher premium on Zion Williamson\u2019s fitness and health than that spot. Otherwise, why keep Williamson on a minutes restriction (he played only 15) and confine him to the bench during the fourth-quarter moment of truth? Williamson did leave the Disney campus due to a family matter and just returned a few days prior to tip. Also, he missed the first three months of the season after arthroscopic knee surgery, and obviously there was the four-month pandemic layoff. Essentially, then, Williamson has been a rare sighting in practices and games in this, a most inactive rookie season. Without Williamson the Pelicans had few answers and options when the Jazz rallied for a comeback and pulled away in the final seconds. \u201cOf course we wish we could\u2019ve played him down the stretch, but we used the minutes that were given to us and that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. \u201cThe medical people said we played them in the minutes that we\u2019re allowed for us to play him, and just move on.\u201d This might be an issue as the Pelicans progress through the eight-game seeded segment of the schedule; they need to be at least four games behind the eighth-place team \u2014 that the Memphis Grizzlies at the moment \u2014 to have any chance at staying in Orlando. At stake is a potential Zion-LeBron ratings-busting first-round matchup. \u201cYeah, I wanted to be out there,\u201d said Williamson, \u201cbut I was just working my way back into my flow. That\u2019s all it is. Every competitor wants to win every game. But it\u2019s just a learning curve, and we\u2019re gonna get past it. It is frustrating, but it\u2019s not so frustrating because they could probably not even let me play.\u201d In the big picture, all things considered, there isn\u2019t any legitimate reason for frustration, not for Williamson or anyone else in the hermetically -sealed Disney campus or among basketball fans. Coaches are coaching again, players are playing again, fans are cheering again, at least online in the comfort of their homes. Here in the midst of a global health crisis, and inside a state where it rages, the NBA has set up a safe space to get back to business. The ball has bounce again, and so does the 35-year-old legs on LeBron, and same for the interrupted 2019-20 season."},{"id":26710,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/players-coaches-kneel-nbas-re-opening-night","date":"2020-07-31","title":"Players, coaches kneel before NBA's re-opening night","content":"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Black players were next to white players. Coaches from one team were next to their compatriots from the opposing side. Many locked arms with the man next to them, some shut their eyes tightly, a few raised their fists into the air. The NBA had a strong, powerful re-opening night message. When it comes to demanding change, the league stands united \u2014 and on Thursday, the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans showed that by not standing. An unprecedented image for the league in unprecedented times: The Jazz and Pelicans knelt alongside one another during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d their way of joining the chorus of those demanding racial justice and equality in society. The NBA has a rule that dates back to the early 1980s decreeing that players must stand for the national anthem, and Commissioner Adam Silver quickly announced that the policy is being adjusted. \u201cI respect our teams\u2019 unified act of peaceful protest for social justice and under these unique circumstances will not enforce our long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our national anthem,\u201d said Silver, who watched from a plexiglass-enclosed suite because he has not been quarantined and therefore cannot be around players and coaches who are living inside the NBA\u2019s so-called bubble at Walt Disney World. The coaches, New Orleans\u2019 Alvin Gentry and Utah\u2019s Quin Snyder, were next to one another, their arms locked together. The scene, which occurred with the teams lined up along the sideline nearest where \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d was painted onto the court, was the first of what is expected to be many silent game-day statements by players and coaches who will kneel to call attention to many issues \u2014 foremost among them, police brutality following the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months. Even the game referees took a knee during the pregame scene. The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were expected to also take some sort of action before the second game of the re-opening night doubleheader later Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that all of us, in a unified way, turn attention to social justice,\u201d Snyder said during a televised in-game interview. \u201cAnd all the players, all the coaches, are united in that fact and committed to do what we can do to effect long-term change.\u201d Many players warmed up wearing shirts that said \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Thursday also marked the debut of new jerseys bearing messages that many players chose to have added, such as \u201cEquality\u201d and \u201cPeace.\u201d The NBA season was suspended when Rudy Gobert \u2014 who also scored the first basket of the restarted season \u2014 of the Jazz tested positive for the coronavirus and became the first player in the league with such a diagnosis. Gobert was diagnosed on March 11; two days later, Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot when police officers burst into her Louisville, Kentucky apartment using a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation. The warrant was in connection with a suspect who did not live there and no drugs were found. Then on May 25, Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into the Black man\u2019s neck for nearly eight minutes. That happened on a street, with the images \u2014 and sounds of the man saying he couldn\u2019t breathe, then crying out for his mother \u2014 all captured on a cell phone video. NBA players have used their platforms \u2014 both in the bubble and on social media \u2014 to demand equality, to demand justice for Taylor. Coaches have also said it is incumbent on them to demand change and educate themselves and others. And the pregame actions by the Jazz and the Pelicans were just the start of what is expected to be a constant during the remainder of this season. \u201cWe want our lives to be valued as much as everybody else,\u201d Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum said in a video that aired before the game, a project organized by both the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that we\u2019re better. We want to be seen as equals.\u201d Added Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard and president of the NBPA, speaking in the same video: \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to change until we sort of make them change.\u201d Gentry said he appreciated the accidental symmetry that came from the first games of the restarted season coming only hours after the funeral for U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who died July 17 at the age of 80. Lewis spent most of his life championing civil rights and equality and was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington \u2014 the one where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Gentry said he believes this movement, like the one Lewis helped spark six decades ago, will endure. \u201cIf you talk to some of the younger generation, I think this is here to stay. I really do,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI have a 20-year-old son and a 22-year-old son, and I know that they feel like this is the most opportune time for us to try to have change in this country.\u201d"},{"id":26677,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-social-justice-opening-night-season-restart","date":"2020-07-30","title":"Social justice at the heart of NBA season restart in Orlando","content":"From messages on their jerseys and shoes to displays of solidarity during the national anthem, here\u2019s a look at the social justice statements from the opening days of the restart. * * *"},{"id":26672,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-active-season-restart-utah-jazz","date":"2020-07-30","title":"Zion Williamson available for Pelicans tonight","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.

Not unexpectedly, LeVert had a top-five usage rate in the week of scrimmages. No matter the stakes, an abundance of ball-handling reps are great for the development of a still-developing player. And it\u2019s very likely that LeVert, who turns 26 in August, will get some of those reps in a playoff series against one of the two best defensive teams in the league, either the Milwaukee Bucks or the Toronto Raptors. But, assuming he\u2019s back with the Nets, LeVert will have a much different role next season. No matter how well he plays over the next few weeks, he\u2019ll be the third option behind two of the best scorers in the world. With everybody healthy in 2020-21, LeVert could still be featured in the Nets\u2019 second-unit offense for 5-7 minutes per half, even if he starts games alongside Irving and Durant. But how well will LeVert complement the Nets\u2019 two stars when all three are on the floor together? Just how ideal of an option is he off the ball? His catch-and-shoot numbers would be reason for concern. Over the last two seasons (both interrupted by injury), LeVert has shot just 40-for-135 (29.6%) on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers . That\u2019s neither a success rate nor a volume (just 2.2 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts per 36 minutes) you\u2019d want alongside two stars. That doesn\u2019t make defenses pay for sending extra defenders to the ball, nor does it discourage them from doing so in the first place. But LeVert\u2019s shot isn\u2019t broken. In fact, his pull-up 3-point percentage has improved every season he\u2019s been in the league, from 31.1% as a rookie to 41.5%, the second best mark among 60 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 100 pull-up 3s, this season. It may just be that LeVert is more comfortable with the ball in his hands. And why not? He definitely has some stuff in his bag. LeVert\u2019s herky-jerky game enables him to navigate multiple paths to the basket. He ranks 19th with 14.1 drives per game , one of two players in the top 20 (Derrick Rose is the other) averaging fewer than 30 minutes. Unfortunately, while he passes the eye test, LeVert\u2019s season-long, off-the-dribble numbers have not been good. Play 1. With Michael Carter-Williams preparing to go over Wilson Chandler\u2019s screen, LeVert goes the other way and finishes with a wrong-foot floater over Mo Bamba. Number to know: 30% of LeVert\u2019s shots have been non-restricted-area shots in the paint. That\u2019s the fifth highest rate among 137 players with at least 500 field goal attempts. The 35.4% he\u2019s shot on those ranks 79th among 95 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 100. Play 2. LeVert uses a sideline screen from DeAndre Jordan, snakes into the paint and finishes with his left hand over John Collins. Number to know: According to Synergy play-type tracking, the 0.82 points per possession that LeVert has scored as a pick-and-roll ball-handler are down from 0.93 last season and rank 43rd among 49 players who\u2019ve averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. Play 3. LeVert isolates against Kyle Anderson, gets into the paint, and uses a left-shoulder spin move to get back to his right hand. Number to know: The 0.69 points per possession that LeVert has scored on isolations are down from 0.94 last season and rank last among 30 players who have averaged at least two iso possessions per game. Play 4. After a made bucket, LeVert pushes the ball up the floor and hits Dejounte Murray with a wicked Eurostep. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, LeVert has an effective field goal percentage of 69.6% in the first six seconds of the shot clock and just 44.0% thereafter. That\u2019s the second biggest drop among 188 players with at least 50 field goal attempts in the first six seconds. Play 5. As the Nets run an action for Joe Harris on the right side of the floor, LeVert blows by DeMar DeRozan, going left. He then hits the breaks and finishes through contact. Number to know: LeVert\u2019s free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) has been steady through his four seasons. His rate of 26.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field this season ranks 27th among 137 players with at least 500 field goal attempts. Play 6. On a pick-and-roll with Jarrett Allen, LeVert drives at Rudy Gobert. When the two-time Defensive Player of the Year stays on the ground, LeVert finishes with his left hand. Number to know: LeVert\u2019s field goal percentage in the restricted area has dropped every season he\u2019s been in the league, from 65.8% as a rookie to 53.5% ( 187th among 204 players with at least 100 restricted-area attempts) this season. LeVert\u2019s assist rate (assists per 100 possessions) used is a career-low 17.0 this season. But three of his 12 career games with eight or more assists came in February and March. That included his first career triple-double in a win over the Spurs on March 6. He\u2019s not LeBron James or Chris Paul in regard to knowing what the defender is going to do before the defender knows himself, but LeVert doesn\u2019t have tunnel vision either. And he was making some good (and varied) reads before the season was suspended. Play 1. On the third try, an Allen screen gets LeVert free of Kemba Walker. He gets to the basket, gets Daniel Theis to commit, and hits Allen with a last-second drop-off. Number to know: The Nets rank 15th in assist rate (having recorded assists on 60.2% of their field goals), but 25th in ball movement (316 passes per 24 minutes of possession). Play 2. LeVert isolates against DeRozan, draws help from Murray with one dribble and immediately kicks the ball back to Dinwiddie for an open 3-pointer. Number to know: Among Nets that have played more than 20 games, Dinwiddie (20.6 and 6.8) and LeVert (17.7 and 4.1) rank first and second in both points and assists per game. But they have just 27 total assists to each other. Their rate of just 1.7 assists to each other per 36 minutes on the floor together is the fourth lowest among the league\u2019s 30 pairs of leading scorers . Play 3. Allen has just half a step on Wendell Carter Jr. in transition, but LeVert is able to thread the needle. Number to know: LeVert has 159 total assists to 13 different teammates, with the most ( 27 ) going to Allen. Play 4. Carter steps up on a pick-and-roll and LeVert hits Allen with a dart before Lauri Markkanen can get there. Number to know: Allen has scored 1.34 points per possession as a roll man, the best mark among 27 players who have averaged at least 2.5 roll man possessions per game. Play 5. LeVert beats Avery Bradley off the dribble and draws help from James. When JaVale McGee sinks down to prevent the lob to Jordan, LeVert kicks out to Chandler on the weak side. Number to know: The Nets are the only team that ranks in the top five in both the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area (36.7%, second) and in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (42.0%, fifth ). LeVert isn\u2019t an unwilling shooter off the catch, and he\u2019s had his moments. He\u2019s 7-for-14 on clutch 3-pointers this season, and that includes 4-for-8 off the catch. One of those four makes came after a jab step, but the other three ( one , two , three ) looked smooth and confident. But there have also been times where LeVert hasn\u2019t been ready or willing to shoot when he has the space. League-wide, the only things more valuable than a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer (1.1 points per attempt) are layups (1.2) and trips to the free throw line (1.5). So if you give up an open look off the catch, you\u2019d better get to the bucket or to the stripe. Play 1. LeVert is already at the free throw line. When Taurean Prince rebounds his miss, Brandon Ingram doesn\u2019t match up with anybody and Prince eventually finds LeVert wide open behind the arc. But LeVert isn\u2019t quick to shoot and Ingram is able to match up. LeVert\u2019s drive doesn\u2019t bear fruit and JJ Redick draws a charge on Joe Harris. Number to know: The Nets have committed 2.9 more turnovers per game than their opponents. That\u2019s the league\u2019s second worst differential. Play 2. After another offensive rebound, the ball is swung to an open LeVert at the top of the arc. He hesitates twice and, after Draymond Green continues to give him space, misses the 3-pointer. Number to know: The Nets are one of two teams (Minnesota is the other) that rank in the top five in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (42.0%, fifth ), but in the bottom five in 3-point percentage (34.0%, 26th ). Play 3. A Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot drive draws two to the ball and it\u2019s again swung to LeVert at the top of the arc. He has space and time to shoot, but puts the ball on the floor and misses a floater in the paint. Number to know: LeVert has averaged just 2.7 \u201cspot-up\u201d possessions per game, according to Synergy. That number ranks 132nd in the league , and the 0.85 points per possession he\u2019s scored on those rank 144th among 162 players that have averaged 2.5 spot-up possessions per game. Play 4. After another offensive rebound, the Sixers\u2019 defense is scrambled and LeVert has another open look at the top of the arc. He gets around Josh Richardson\u2019s close-out, but misses another floater. Number to know: The Nets are one of four teams (the season is over for the other three) that rank in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage (44.4%, 26th), 3-point percentage (34.0%, 26th), and free throw percentage (74.4%, 25th). Play 5. Trae Young sinks off LeVert in the right corner when Harris drives into the paint. LeVert has the opportunity to shoot over the shorter defender, but instead puts the ball on the floor and isolates. Young makes his case for First Team All-Defense and LeVert tosses up an ugly turnaround jumper as the shot clock expires. Number to know: This will be the 19th time in the last 20 seasons that the Nets have scored fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average. (The only exception was their first season in Brooklyn .) And unless they have a much more efficient slate of seeding games than the 19th-ranked Kings or 20th-ranked Grizzlies, it will 13th time in the last 20 years that they\u2019ve ranked in the bottom 10 offensively . Brooklyn\u2019s streak of seven straight years as a worse-than-average offensive team should end next season when Durant makes his Nets debut. But their ceiling will depend on the players surrounding their two stars and the rim-running of either Allen or Jordan. Of the three perimeter Nets that have been around for the last four seasons, Harris \u2013 13th all-time in 3-point percentage , though probably not as aggressive as a shooter as he should be \u2013 is the most obvious complement. He\u2019s also an unrestricted free agent this offseason. It\u2019s been written multiple times in this Film Study series (with Boston , Utah and Oklahoma City ) that three or four ball-handlers is better than one or two. You don\u2019t need to pass like the Spurs in the 2014 Finals to score efficiently, and lots of teams take advantage of a rotating defense with secondary attacks. Multiple guys with some juice off the dribble can lead to a greater chance of creating an advantage (a lane to the basket or an open shooter) for the offense. But sometimes, the advantage gained is an open shot from beyond the arc. And if you pass up that shot, the advantage could be lost for good. If LeVert doesn\u2019t improve as an off-the-catch shooter, he might not get enough respect off the ball on big possessions and in big games. He doesn\u2019t need to be Duncan Robinson in that regard , but he does need to keep defenses honest when the ball is in the hands of Irving or Durant. The Nets are without both Dinwiddie and Irving for the remainder of this season, but LeVert played 804 (71%) of his 1,131 pre-hiatus minutes with one or both also on the floor. And while Jrue Holiday (who\u2019s been a relatively disengaged off-the-ball defender this season) didn\u2019t give him much respect in an early-season matchup \u2026  \u2026 most other teams did. Here are a few possessions from the second half of the Nets\u2019 loss in Miami on Feb. 29 \u2026 1. When Harris curls off two screens, Jimmy Butler (known to venture defensively) takes a step toward the shooter, but doesn\u2019t commit and actually takes a peak back at LeVert. 2. When Dinwiddie drives around Bam Adebayo in Butler\u2019s direction, Butler again takes one step toward helping, but then turns his attention back to LeVert. 3. When Harris flares to an open 3-pointer before Goran Dragic can get there, Jae Crowder slides back toward LeVert rather than trying to contest last season\u2019s leader in 3-point percentage. That game was one of the final 16 before the season was suspended, a stretch in which LeVert averaged 24.1 points , 4.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists upon being moved back into the starting lineup. Three nights after the Miami game, he dropped a career-high 51 points against a top-five defense in Boston. The triple-double against the Spurs came three nights after that. That wasn\u2019t the only limited stretch over which LeVert has looked like the real deal. Over the first 12 games of last season, he led the Nets with 20.3 points per game on 49% shooting. In last year\u2019s playoffs, he was the team\u2019s best player, averaging 21 points on an effective field goal percentage of 58% in their series against Philly. But, with injuries and now with a global pandemic, sustained success has been elusive. And despite those last 16 games, it\u2019s been an inefficient \u201919-20 for a player who had seemingly broke out on the postseason stage a year ago. LeVert\u2019s true shooting percentage of 50.9% is the lowest mark among 40 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. While his pull-up 3-point percentage ranks second in the league, all his other shooting numbers have been sub-par. Brooklyn has a lot to look forward to. No matter what happens in free agency, the Nets will be getting the biggest influx of talent in the Eastern Conference (start your Irving and Durant vs. Curry and Thompson debate here). But they still have big offseason questions regarding their head coach and their supporting cast. The \u201cfit\u201d questions don\u2019t end with LeVert, because Dinwiddie (under contract for next season with a player option for \u201921-22) is also at his best with the ball in his hands. Dinwiddie (5.15, 10th), Irving (4.55, 25th) and LeVert (4.40, 30th) all rank in the top 30 in average dribbles per touch among the 294 players with at least 1,000 touches this season. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think that swapping one of those guys for a better off-the-ball option would raise the Nets\u2019 ceiling. LeVert is about to climb in those dribble-per-touch rankings. And with a contract extension already set to kick in next season, the next few weeks will be an opportunity for him to improve his numbers, regain his rhythm, and show the league what he can do in a leading role. Alas, that might not help answer any questions about how the Nets move forward. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He returned the Minnesota Timberwolves to the playoffs after a 13-year absence. All the while, there was one challenge he sought. He has seen what it\u2019s like in New York when the Knicks win and wanted to be the coach to make it happen again. \u201cThis a dream come true for me,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cThis is my dream job.\u201d He got it Thursday, when the Knicks brought the former NBA Coach of the Year back to the organization he helped reach the NBA Finals as an assistant. Thibodeau was an assistant with the Knicks from 1996-2003, part of Jeff Van Gundy\u2019s staff when they made a run from the No. 8 seed to the finals in 1999. He\u2019s had success all around the NBA since he left and the Knicks have had almost none, but that hasn\u2019t dampened his desire to come back. \u201cMaybe part of that is I grew up in Connecticut. My father, my family, we grew up as Knick fans,\u201d Thibodeau said during a Zoom press conference. \u201cI think I experienced it during the \u201990s that there\u2019s no better place to be than Madison Square Garden. And so I love challenges, I love that city, I love the arena, I love the fans and I\u2019m excited about the team.\u201d Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Thibodeau, 62, is 352-246 in eight seasons coaching Chicago and Minnesota. He was the Coach of the Year in 2011 in his first season with the Bulls, whom he led to 50 wins in three of his five seasons. The Bulls had the best record in the league in each of his first two seasons and their 62 wins in Thibodeau\u2019s rookie campaign were their most since 1997-98, when they won the last of six championships behind Jordan. Then Thibodeau went to Minnesota, where a 47-win season in 2017-18 got the Timberwolves back to the postseason for the first time since 2004. New Knicks President Leon Rose watched Thibodeau\u2019s work all those years, sometimes when players he represented as an agent played for his teams, and felt his friend was the ideal candidate for the Knicks because he would demand accountability, develop players and bring a winning culture to New York. \u201cI mean there\u2019s no doubt that our relationship gives me a level of comfort, but I know and I\u2019ve watched him work over the last 20 years and the fact that he\u2019s won everywhere he\u2019s been was an overriding factor,\u201d Rose said. Meanwhile, the Knicks have done little winning during that time. New York has won just one playoff series since Van Gundy resigned early in the 2001-02 season and just completed its seventh straight losing season. The Knicks fired David Fizdale 22 games into the season and finished under interim coach Mike Miller, going 21-45. Rose then conducted a long search before tabbing Thibodeau to be the 13th different person to coach the Knicks since Van Gundy. Knicks leadership sees in Thibodeau\u2019s teams what\u2019s long been missing at Madison Square Garden: a willingness to play as a team and compete every night. \u201cWe, along with our fan base, expect these qualities to be on display on a daily basis,\u201d general manager Scott Perry said. Thibodeau also reached the finals twice as an assistant to Doc Rivers with the Boston Celtics, winning the 2008 championship. He is regarded as one of the league\u2019s best and most demanding defensive coaches. He will try to bring back the defensive intensity that the Knicks were known for in the 1990s. His teams twice led the league in fewest points per game allowed in his eight seasons as a head coach and ranked in the top 10 three other times. His last season was his rockiest. He was fired by the Timberwolves midway through the 2018-19 season that began when star Jimmy Butler sought to be traded. But he isn\u2019t afraid of another rebuilding project, saying he liked the Knicks\u2019 youth and pointing to the draft picks and salary cap space available in coming years. He hopes to get started working with the players in August if the NBA approves a plan to allow the eight teams who didn\u2019t make the restart at Walt Disney World to begin workouts in their home market. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get going,\u201d Thibodeau said."},{"id":26659,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-new-enhancements-sideline-official-release","date":"2020-07-30","title":"NBA announces new polices, procedures for season restart","content":" NEW YORK \u2013The NBA today announced new elements and enhancements to existing policies and procedures in Basketball Operations, Referee Operations and other areas for the resumption of the 2019-20 season, including a wider border around the sidelines, a revised setup for team benches and a new covering on officials\u2019 whistles. \u201cNew elements implemented for the season restart reflect a collaboration among the league, players, coaches, referees and team staff, underscore a willingness by all parties to adapt to a challenging environment, and reinforce our commitment to the health and safety of everyone involved,\u201d said NBA President, League Operations Byron Spruell. The new elements and enhancements include: \u2022 Sideline Border: To assist with perception and visibility on the court and adjust for not having courtside fans to help define the boundaries, the border around the court has been widened to 8 inches from 2 inches. During a throw-in from out of bounds, the thrower-in may continue to step on the line but may not touch the floor over the line until the ball is released. \u2022 Team Benches: Team benches consist of multiple rows of seats (with appropriate distance between each seat) and are divided into three sections: players; coaches and team staff; and unassigned seats. The 17-seat players section is divided into three rows, with each player assigned a seat by his team. The 12-seat coaches and team staff section, slightly separated from the players section, is divided into three rows of four seats, with each person assigned a seat by his or her team. The unassigned seats section is located near the baseline and reserved only for temporary use to enable player-to-player, coach-to-player or trainer\/physician-to-player communication during the game. The unassigned seats are promptly cleaned and disinfected after each use. \u2022 Timeouts: During any timeout or period break, players and coaches can huddle like normal except they must sit in or congregate around movable chairs separate and apart from the team benches. The movable chairs used during timeouts or period breaks are cleaned and disinfected after each use. \u2022 Officials\u2019 Whistles: A cloth covering has been added to the referees\u2019 whistles to prevent the spread of spittle. \u2022 Replay Officials: Replay officials, who make decisions on certain replay situations and facilitate the on-the-court review of others, are working on site at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida rather than at the NBA Replay Center in Secaucus, N.J. The NBA Replay Center will continue to conduct reviews in conjunction with the on-court officials. \u2022 Injury Reporting Procedures: Five hours (local time) prior to the start time of the second game of a back-to-back (instead of 1 p.m. local time) is when teams must designate a participation status (Out, Doubtful, Questionable, Probable or Available) for each player on their roster and identify a specific injury, illness or potential instance of a healthy player resting that may affect any player\u2019s participation in the game. \u2022 Baseline Positioning: Broadcast camera operators, photographers or videographers may not be positioned on the hardwood and instead must shoot away from the floor. \u2022 Scorer\u2019s Table: The scorer\u2019s table is surrounded by plexiglass. \u2022 Coach\u2019s Attire: Head coaches and assistant coaches are permitted to wear polo shirts instead of business attire.

The orange basketball has taken its share of strange bounces throughout the 74-season history of the NBA, none loopier than the series of ricochets that began last fall and will continue into this fall. The crowning of the next NBA champion, therefore, will elicit a pair of celebrations \u2014 one of joy for the victors, one of relief for the league\u2019s improbable journey. The restart of the 2019-20 season, which endured a four-month pause caused by coronavirus, will officially launch Thursday evening inside a pair of small gyms at Walt Disney\u2019s Wide World of Sports. Normally occupied by youth sports teams that flock to Disney in summertime, they\u2019ve been tricked out to specifically meet the new requirements for a new world and what the NBA is marketing as a Whole New Game. And so, sometime in early October, the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy will be hoisted in a place without fans, little fanfare and by players who\u2019ll be excused for violating the social distance rule in order to give each other much-needed hugs. \u201cI\u2019m excited about giving the world something to be excited about,\u201d Rockets star James Harden said. \u201cJust some joy and something to look forward to.\u201d If the end-game seems complicated, the starting line was rather mundane back in late September, shortly after training camps started. Amazingly, what passed for \u201cnews\u201d then was a short-lived rap feud between Blazers star Damian Lillard and retired Hall of Famer Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Imagine if the only wreckage in the 2019-20 season was confined to lyrics and a diss track. Instead, drama and headlines only intensified from there. The league found itself in a social bind when Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong while his team and others toured China for exhibition games. Because the NBA and a handful of stars have business ties with China, commissioner Adam Silver had to stomp brush fires while also toeing the line for free speech, which is encouraged within the NBA. Silver later admitted the entire episode cost the NBA hundreds of millions in revenue and placed future China trips and business dealings in jeopardy. And that was only the start of a big money drip. When the season began, it did so without a precocious and much-celebrated No. 1 draft pick. Zion Williamson had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and skipped the first three months, denying the NBA and its TV partners a rookie whose sizzle didn\u2019t arrive until he made his debut in mid-January, better late than never. Other injuries combined to thwart a fully functional league: Stephen Curry, Paul George, Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin and also Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, both done for the season following surgery last summer. Then, former commissioner David Stern passed in winter . Stern was the basketball lord who oversaw great change in the NBA as the league experienced a massive popularity leap and an influx of foreign-born players under his watch. That was followed shortly after by the death of Kobe Bryant from a helicopter crash. The tragedy, which also claimed the lives of all passengers onboard including his young daughter Gigi, hit the NBA family hard. Downtown Los Angeles and especially outside Staples Center became a group therapy site, attracting thousands. \u201cIn that sense, it was a difficult year,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cIt was all very sad, but everybody just buckled down to do their job even though there was a lot of sadness, angst, just part of what we all go through in our lives. All along and every step of the way, the NBA showed great fortitude in dealing with whatever came up.\u201d All of that would be enough to fill an entire season or maybe two. Instead, the 2019-20 season literally split in two, when a positive COVID-19 test by Jazz center Rudy Gobert on March 11 prompted Silver to postpone the season, with no guarantees of a continuation. \u201cAll I know is we\u2019re in Sacramento getting ready to go out and play a game that night and all of a sudden the season shuts down,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. \u201cWe get on a plane at midnight and fly back home and next thing I know, not just the country, but the world was closed down. Life changed.\u201d While science threw the world for a loop, Silver and his NBA elves mapped plans for a restart \u2014 only if all the participants could do so safely. With input from the Center for Disease Control and the TV partners, Silver devised a way to bring 22 teams together under one umbrella at Walt Disney World to decide the 16 playoff teams and then recognize a champion. It was a daunting effort that also required cooperation from the player\u2019s union and state officials in Florida, where the virus raged, and took months to complete. It also took guts. But with billions of dollars at stake and also history \u2014 the league has never not completed a season \u2014 the motivation was heavy. \u201cWe want to get back to work, and by that I mean everyone,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe all want to do what we\u2019re all used to doing. We want to do as much as we can safely do to energize the country, play the game we all love, and as long as we can do it safely, it\u2019s a big win for everybody.\u201d The Disney compound includes hotel ballrooms used as practice facilities, with playing courts trucked in from Miami and Indiana and the Orlando Magic headquarters just up the highway. Testing is conducted daily, not only among players and coaches, but referees, PA announcers, TV technicians, statisticians, media, ballboys and ballgirls and anyone else associated with the operation. Teams are housed in Disney hotels, on separate floors. Nobody unauthorized is allowed on property. Nobody has permission to leave unless for family emergencies. With the Pelicans vs. Jazz ( 6:30 p.m. ET, TNT ) and Clippers vs. Lakers ( 9 ET, TNT ) set to begin the seeding game portion of the restart, the NBA creeps forward, fingers crossed, hoping to pull off a feat that was steep back in spring. \u201cI had no doubts we\u2019d be back playing basketball this season,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI know the NBA. I know Adam and his guys and the people who work in that office and I knew they\u2019d find a way to get it done. Not only would they find a way to get it done, but it would be under the healthiest atmosphere you could possibly be under. \u201cYou think about it, we\u2019ve been down here for almost three weeks and they\u2019ve had no positive tests. So obviously the way they arranged this thing couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d There\u2019s nothing major at stake during the eight-game seeding-game portion of the restart schedule except for the final playoff spot in each conference, mainly the West, where the Blazers, Pelicans and Kings have the most realistic shot at stealing eighth place from the Grizzlies. Once that\u2019s decided, the championship chase will commence with intrigue lurking all over. Last we left, the Lakers and Bucks reigned, led by dueling Kia MVP candidates LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. A handful of other contenders, though, used the hiatus to pounce on regaining full health and will bring revamped lineups to toss at the conference-leading favorites. Pre-hiatus, Jayson Tatum went next level for the Celtics, Ben Simmons shifted to point-forward (with success) for Philly, Kristaps Porzingis was developing a firmer bond with Luka Doncic in Dallas and, of course, Williamson instantly put his stamp on the Pelicans by scoring 20 or more points in 16 of his 19 games since returning from injury. Given all that, and the unpredictability of how the layoff affected each team, the NBA pecking order might shift from where it was pre-hiatus. \u201cEveryone came here to win, and yet we\u2019re so blessed to be in this situation, to be with each other and go out there and do what we do,\u201d Bucks center Brook Lopez said. The idea to house 22 teams together is creating fringe benefits. There\u2019s a spirit of cooperation, not only among teammates, but teams. With regular routines shattered and home lives disrupted at least temporarily, players and coaches only have each other. \u201cDuring the season,\u201d said Sixers center Joel Embiid, \u201cit\u2019s kinda hard to get together. People have families and stuff to do. Being inside the bubble is different. We don\u2019t have anything to do. I don\u2019t like to be outside, it\u2019s too hot for me. So I stay inside with my teammates. We\u2019ve done a lot together and I think It\u2019s helped us a lot and we\u2019ve gotten closer.\u201d Lopez agreed and added: \u201cYou create relationships and bonds that you haven\u2019t created before.\u201d The league is trying to recreate the presentation of the game on the fly. There\u2019s no blueprint for this, for playing without fans, so the game will be made-for-TV, with unique camera angles and electronic boards surrounding the court to simulate energy and enthusiasm and place \u201cfans\u201d in the seats virtually. Almost video-game-like. It\u2019ll make for a new experience, especially for players and coaches who\u2019ll hear the game like they\u2019ve never heard it in the NBA before, with squeaking sneakers and shouted instructions \u2026 and no jeering while preparing to shoot free throws. \u201cAll the ideas from the league are ridiculously creative,\u201d said Celtics coach Brad Stevens, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t say enough good things about the way they\u2019ve set up those courts. We\u2019re all blown away by the setup.\u201d Players admitted to feeling awkward at least initially during the scrimmages but being jolted back to normalcy not long after the opening jump. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what happens outside the lines,\u201d said Antetokounmpo, \u201cyou lose yourself in the game. As we play more, we\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d Do the players have a choice? Does anyone? Steered off-course by a virus, the NBA was confronted with a challenge in a season of several. This is the path the league took, to rally instead of surrender, to turn creative and be proactive, to save the season and by extension, the game. There are no guarantees the league will reach the finish line, but all signs are encouraging, to the extent that if the NBA doesn\u2019t crown a champion and finish what it started, it will be a surprise. \u201cThe league\u2019s done a great job of preparing us here in Orlando,\u201d Popovich. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the safest place in the world. Everybody\u2019s brought in, being very diligent regarding the rules, trying to take care of each other so we can pull this off. \u201cNone of us have the answer as to why we\u2019re at this point. Things happen in our lives all the time, that are unexpected, things that we have to deal with. Obviously this is very disruptive but there\u2019s only one choice, to deal with it, be wise about it, make the best of it and move on.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

At least that\u2019s how LaMarcus Aldridge sees it now, having played in six All-Star games since the first one unwittingly, tragically and jarringly carved the shape of today\u2019s NBA. On a crisp, grey night in February, as Aldridge beamed inside thinking this 2012 NBA All-Star Game might finally stamp accreditation to a life spent grinding to get there, approximately 20 miles Northeast up Interstate 4 in Sanford, Fla., the story unfolding wasn\u2019t so hopeful. \u201cI had mixed emotions,\u201d Aldridge told NBA.com. \u201cI feel like I should\u2019ve made it a couple of years before that. But I was excited to play with the best in the league, to be on that stage to be in that moment.\u201d As the world\u2019s best prepped to tip off the game, 17-year old high school junior Trayvon Martin pulled on a hoodie for a quick walk to 7-Eleven to grab snacks. Toting an iced tea and a bag of Skittles on the way back, Martin would exhale his last breath after a fatal encounter with George Zimmerman left him dying minutes later of a gunshot wound. A paramedic arriving on the scene in Sanford pronounced Martin dead just as the 2012 All-Star Game commenced. \u201cI was sick,\u201d Aldridge recalled. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Man, this has to stop.\u2019 It hit home with the things I\u2019ve seen growing up. We can\u2019t keep letting people get away with saying just because someone is African American and has a hood on, he looks like he\u2019s going to rob someone. It just made more frustration come out. I felt like this injustice just can\u2019t keep happening.\u201d For the first time since that night, the NBA at large has convened in Orlando for the 2019-20 NBA Season Restart . This time, the stakes are immeasurably higher at Walt Disney World with much more on the line than the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, in part due to Martin\u2019s death serving as a tipping point for an NBA now determined more than ever to help combat systemic racism, social injustice and inequality. We all know the Trayvon Martin story painfully well.  Just before approximately 7 million viewers tuned in to watch Kevin Durant and LeBron James stage an epic duel, where the superstars \u2014 who would later meet in the NBA Finals that summer \u2014 scored 36 points apiece, Martin, a Black teenager, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, attempted to walk home from a convenience store, only to be stopped, questioned, attacked and eventually shot to death by a white volunteer of the local neighborhood watch committee. As the incident started to unfold, Zimmerman called local police. A dispatcher ordered Zimmerman to not approach Martin. He did it, anyway, and a scuffle ensued, leading to the shooting death of an unarmed teenager. Suddenly, neither the All-Star Game or the 84th Academy Awards \u2014 which also aired that night \u2014 seemed relevant on the cold, rainy streets of Central Florida. The tragedy in The Retreat at Twin Lakes dwarfed the thrills generated at the Amway Center. A young boy was helplessly killed. His parents lost a child too soon. Seemingly simultaneously, Trayvon Martin\u2019s death woke up the nation and spurred the Black Lives Matter movement. At a time when social media was starting to soar, the movement \u2014 its name now etched onto the courts at Disney \u2014 started with a simple hashtag. At one point, Martin\u2019s death garnered more coverage than the 2012 presidential race. Twitter users tweeted Martin\u2019s name more than two million times in the 30 days after the shooting; his death sparking the biggest petition in Change.org history. Nationwide headlines about the incident would surface weeks later and travel across the country from Florida to Oregon, where Aldridge was playing as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. \u201cI just remember it exploded overnight,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cIt went viral. Everyone was talking about it. It just stunned everyone to have that happen, and to hear what happened just riled everyone up to wake up to what had been going on for years and years. It was in recent times one of the bigger wake-up calls. It happens more often than we hear, but we all heard about that one.\u201d * * * Meanwhile in the NBA and WNBA, the Martin tragedy ushered in a new era in which players started to audaciously use their platforms to speak out against racism and inequality. As we\u2019ve seen living through the COVID-19 pandemic, sports aren\u2019t shielded from what takes place in the world. The majority of professional basketball players are Black. So, naturally, Martin\u2019s death resonated deeper as players longed to serve as a voice for the voiceless and raise awareness while showing the world where they stood in the fight for equality. The sartorial protests started in 2012 with members of the Miami Heat, led by James and Dwyane Wade, donning hoodies in tribute to Martin with the hashtag #WeAreTrayvonMartin. The next month, audio was released from former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks. In silent protests, the Clippers tossed their warm-up jackets on the floor at center court before Game 4 of their opening round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors and wore their pregame shirts inside out. The NBA banned Sterling for life two days later . By July of 2013, Black Lives Matter officially became a movement with chapters forming around the country after Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Martin. Understandably, James took issue last week with use of the word \u201cmovement\u201d to describe Black Lives Matter. \u201cWhen you\u2019re Black, it\u2019s not a movement,\u201d James said recently after a team scrimmage. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle. We sit here and say it\u2019s a movement. This is a walk of life. When you wake up and you\u2019re Black, that is what it is. This is who we are. We understand that, and we know that for one step that someone else might have to take or for one yard someone else may have to take, we know we\u2019ve got to take five more steps. We know we\u2019ve got to take 10 more yards to get to the end zone. \u201c Recent history indicates as much. In July and August of 2014, Eric Garner and Michael Brown Jr. suffered deaths at the hands of police in separate incidents in Staten Island, N.Y. and Ferguson, Mo. Derrick Rose hit the court that December wearing a black shirt emblazoned with Garner\u2019s last words before his death: \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe.\u201d A week before that, a grand jury had declined to levy charges against the officer who placed Garner in the chokehold that ultimately killed him. The New York Times researched and found at least 70 people died in custody of law enforcement after saying the words: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d More than half of them were Black, with most being stopped or detained over nonviolent infractions, concerns about their mental health, or 911 calls about suspicious behavior. Philando Castile, a Black cafeteria supervisor at a local school was shot and killed in July of 2016 by a police officer in Falcon Heights, Minn., during an incident caught on video just a day before Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old Black man in Baton Rouge, La., died after being shot in custody of police with bystanders recording on video. In response, the Minnesota Lynx wore black t-shirts before a game against the Dallas Wings that said: \u201cChange Starts with Us \u2014 Justice & Accountability\u201d on the front, followed by the names of Castile and Sterling on the back, as well as the Dallas police shield in honor of the victims of the July 7, 2016 attack on Dallas police with \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d written underneath.  Less than a week later, James, Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony opened the 2016 ESPYS with a stirring speech about the state of affairs in this country. \u201cWe cannot ignore the realities of the current state of America,\u201d Anthony said then. \u201cThe events of the past week have put a spotlight on the injustice, distrust and anger that plagues so many of us. The system is broken. The problems are not new, the violence is not new, and the racial divide definitely is not new.\u201d * * *  In 2020, the cries for justice intensified around the world and in sports following the fatalities of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. These efforts towards economic and financial empowerment, police reform, voter suppression, legislation, education and incarceration by no means cover the entirety of the work taking place across the league, but rather a dozen instances reflective of an increased desire to fight for lasting change. * * * When the San Antonio Spurs first emerged from quarantine July 11 at Walt Disney World, instead of rushing to the court to conduct a practice, the team spent the first hour of the scheduled workout discussing race relations, inequality and social justice. Popovich has worked diligently for more than two decades with his team conducting such difficult conversations. Popovich anticipated the hourlong talk to be \u201cjust a continuation\u201d of how he\u2019s always conducted business. \u201cBut probably with much more feeling, more factual knowledge, more empathy for how much hurt, how much fear, how much inequity has really been imposed upon the Black community over the years,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAs much as we\u2019ve talked about it, as many people as we\u2019ve had come and talk to our team, or books passed out, even for people like myself, who sort of think we had a good feel for injustice and inequality, we didn\u2019t know crap. \u201cAnd it\u2019s mostly an educational thing. We talk about the police, and we know there are movements like voter suppression. [There] are still calls [that] Black people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, people who still don\u2019t understand that the wealth difference has nothing to do with marriage, education or anything else. It has to do with the labor that has never been paid for, all this time. So, what I hope for is that educationally, empathetically, our society changes, mostly because the impetus of this virus has made it so obvious to everybody that this wealth gap is the biggest problem we have. We have to make sure we aim high, I think.\u201d Aldridge agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep pushing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be satisfied with a little bit of change. That\u2019s what they want. They want you to get a little change, feel good about it, and then be quiet about it when it all of a sudden goes back to where it was. We\u2019ve got to keep pushing for change, keep pushing to be treated equal, keep pushing for the next generation.\u201d Having undergone shoulder surgery in June, Aldridge can\u2019t help San Antonio in its bid to break an NBA record by advancing to the playoffs for the 23rd consecutive season. The truth is that for the Spurs, and likely most other teams, the postseason pales in comparison to the responsibility the league will be shouldering once the season resumes. So, like any other teammate unable to contribute in the flesh, Aldridge will root from afar at home in Dallas. When this season finally ends with a 2020 champion crowned, perhaps he\u2019ll experience those \u201cmixed emotions\u201d again from that first All-Star experience in Orlando when pondering the progress made towards social justice and equality. He laughed joking that \u201cI should\u2019ve been there a long time ago.\u201d But for the entire world, \u201ca long time ago\u201d can\u2019t come soon enough.  * * * Michael C.

The program, which is a part of NBA Together, the league\u2019s global community and social engagement campaign that aims to support, engage, educate and inspire youth, families and fans in response to the coronavirus pandemic, tipped off earlier this month and will run through August. The Health and Safety Protocols for the Resumption of the 2019-20 NBA Season, which were finalized with the National Basketball Players Association in June, included plans for several community testing programs. Public health data has made clear that the impacts of the coronavirus are most concentrated in historically marginalized communities of color where access to testing is scarce. To meet this need, the NBA collaborated with UnidosUS and the National Urban League as well as several private laboratories to identify communities most in need and provide access to no-cost testing programs in addition to communicating public health information to community members. In partnership with BioReference Laboratories, the league\u2019s testing provider on the NBA campus in Orlando, Fla., the NBA is providing free, daily COVID-19 PCR tests at a mobile collection site at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets. Those interested can register for an appointment by completing a brief survey before being redirected to a scheduling tool to select a convenient date and time for the COVID-19 test. Please visit Appointments.BioReference.com\/NBAOrlando  to complete the survey and for additional details regarding appointments, transportation and scheduling. As part of the NBA\u2019s community testing program, the league, Orlando Magic and Orlando Sports & Entertainment District hosted a pop-up testing event on Saturday, July 11 at the Geico Garage at the Amway Center, providing hundreds of drive-through and walk-up tests to members of surrounding communities. Earlier this month, the NBA identified Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in 29 team markets nationwide and provided additional tests funded by the NBA. In total, these programs are providing thousands of tests across the United States. The league, UnidosUS and National Urban League continue to explore additional testing programs and work together to amplify the latest global health and safety information. Since March, NBA and WNBA players, legends and coaches have filmed more than 45 PSAs to share support and tips for reducing risk and staying healthy, including recent messages about the importance of wearing face coverings, hand washing and physical distancing following the recent surge of cases around the country. To date, the PSAs have been viewed more than 65 million times across the league\u2019s digital and social platforms. Recent PSAs from NBA and WNBA players and legends, including NBA champion Stephen Curry, NBA All-Star Victor Oladipo, WNBA champion Candace Parker and more, can be viewed at www.NBATogether.com . The NBA is also working with The Fight Is In Us , a nationwide coalition of health officials and other partners, to encourage COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma for virus research and treatments and to share the latest health and safety information and r esources regarding the pandemic.  The league is continuing its support of scientific research into more accessible testing through research partnerships with the Yale School of Public Health, the Mayo Clinic, and other leading research institutions. The NBA\u2019s support of expanded access to testing with the Yale School of Public Health is focused on validating and obtaining FDA approval for a non-invasive saliva test for the coronavirus that reduces test turnaround times and costs less than current tests, which would allow the test to become widely available across many communities. In addition, the league is supporting multiple other academic and industry partners on pooled testing and rapid turnaround testing that could provide models for businesses reopening safely and for important public health uses including outbreak assessment and control.

Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said \u201cit\u2019ll be a game-time decision\u201d that will \u201call depend on how he\u2019s feeling\u201d on Thursday when New Orleans faces the Utah Jazz ( 6:30 ET, TNT ) for the first of its eight seeding games to restart the NBA season. \u201cI was gone for seven or eight days with an urgent family matter,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThen, I had to sit in a room for four days. The NBA isn\u2019t something you can usually just straight into, especially off of stuff like that. So, I think me and my team are gonna look to see what\u2019s best and [see] if I\u2019m ready to go out there.\u201d Williamson was excused to leave the NBA campus on Jul. 16, and rejoined his team on Friday, before finishing out a four-day quarantine on Tuesday. \u201cIn the room for four days, I was able to do some body workouts just to keep my muscles going,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I was away, it\u2019s tough to do stuff. I was dealing with a family emergency. So, it\u2019s God first, then family. Basketball wasn\u2019t really there. I was dealing with something serious.\u201d Gentry said the Pelicans participated in a light workout Wednesday in preparation for Thursday\u2019s season restart against the Jazz. Williamson hinted that he\u2019s leaning toward playing against the Jazz, but Gentry plans to defer to the team\u2019s medical staff regarding a potential minutes-restriction for the rookie so as not to jeopardize his long-term future. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I would leave up to the medical staff. Obviously as a coach, you\u2019d want him out there as much as you possibly can have him out there,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cBut we have guys that are better equipped to make those decisions than I am from just a health standpoint and a minutes-played standpoint. It\u2019ll be collectively something that\u2019s done by sitting down and talking about it, trying to figure it out, if he does end up playing.\u201d Before the NBA suspended the season in March, Williamson had played in 19 games, averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds on 58.9% shooting from the floor and 46.2% from deep. \u201cIf you know me, I want to hoop,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I am.

Guard Eric Gordon will miss approximately two weeks because of a left ankle sprain, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Wednesday. ESPN\u2019s Tim Bontemps reported Tuesday night that the Rockets feared Gordon would miss anywhere from one to two weeks because of the injury. Gordon was helped off the floor late in the first half of Tuesday\u2019s scrimmage between Houston and Boston after landing on Vincent Poirier\u2019s foot. The former Kia Sixth Man of the Year would not return. Gordon, who at 14.9 points per game was the Rockets\u2019 third-leading scorer during the regular season, exited with nine points in 15 minutes. Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni later told reporters that X-Rays were negative for Gordon\u2019s left ankle, and that he would be out for \u201ca few days.\u201d The 2016-17 winner of the Kia Sixth Man of the Year, Gordon appeared in 34 games for Houston this season but only started 13 of those. He had surgery on his right knee in November, which caused him to miss six weeks of the season and he missed six of Houston\u2019s last 12 games while dealing with soreness in that knee. Gordon\u2019s health will be a key to Houston\u2019s success because of his strong 3-point shooting. The 31-year-old shot 36% from 3-point range last season, but that number dropped to 32% this year \u2014 his lowest percentage since 2013."},{"id":26765,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/season-restart-international-players-official-release","date":"2020-07-29","title":"Season restart to feature 89 international players from 34 countries","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The 2019-20 NBA season restart will reach fans in 215 countries and territories in 47 languages on their televisions, computers, mobile phones and tablets, highlighting a whole new game with a more connected and immersive experience for fans.

It\u2019s stifling and restricting and limiting and whenever we bemoan being fenced in, we\u2019re being \u2026 selfish. We\u2019re certainly not alone on an Earth that has stopped revolving. In fact, the families we left behind have their feet in cement, too. You have kids? Can you imagine a summer being stuck in the house for the most part?  I have it easy. My daughter, Victoria, on the other hand, does not. She\u2019s an All-American track athlete who\u2019ll begin her final year as a graduate student at the University of Georgia. Last winter, she copped the opportunity of her young life: An internship with NBC and a trip to Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics. Those are coveted spots, awarded to very few. And if that wasn\u2019t good enough: Weeks later, she earned another summer internship offer, from Nike, which accepts less than 2% of those who apply. It became a hard decision. After much thought, she took Nike because she\u2019d be based in New York City for an entire summer and it stretched longer than the NBC job. And when coronavirus forced the Olympics to postpone until 2021, it appeared she chose wisely. But this pandemic spares no one, and her visions of staying in a cramped Manhattan apartment and people-watching in the Village and getting a cultural fix in Harlem and at the museums and in Soho went poof \u2026 when Nike\u2019s New York office shut down until further notice. That meant all interns had to work remotely. Which meant a 22-year-old would remain inside her childhood home, using a spare bedroom transformed into an office, and spend her time sitting in front of a laptop for hours while Zooming. She is blessed, absolutely. And also trapped, confined and restricted. She is you. And me. And everyone else. Her grand plans had to be recalibrated and refitted into a new reality, and it\u2019s not the experience she wanted or would\u2019ve preferred. I hear it in her voice during our calls to reconnect. There is stress and a hint of disappointment mixed with concern for next month, when she returns UGA. Will she also do most if not all her classes online? What about her final track season? All NCAA spring sports were canceled four months ago, which gave her an extra year of eligibility. But college sports, especially the non-revenue kind, are caught in a fog of uncertainty right now. Will there even be a track season? As parents, your emotions reflect those of your children. It\u2019s the inescapable link that barely wanes over time, even when they become adults. Ask me how my day\u2019s going, and that depends on how her day\u2019s going. We\u2019re all trying to make this work while embracing opportunity and good fortune and understanding that health and safety are what\u2019s most important. But none of us are alone. We\u2019re all linked together. Until there\u2019s a sudden turn of events scientifically and a new reality in this perplexed world, we\u2019re all family. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

This isn\u2019t the Tour de France but more like the Tour de Campus, where men and women on bikes is the preferred option for those looking for exercise and fresh air and maybe a reason to reclaim their childhood. There aren\u2019t many things to do for hundreds of people occupying the NBA ecosystem at Walt Disney World, and so riding bikes has become a thing. Some players and personnel who planned this trip properly had the bright ideal to bring their own bikes. Others are renting them from the hotel \u2014 if they get to them quickly enough. It\u2019s not unusual for the bikes to disappear from the rack by late morning, and then you must hope that someone\u2019s legs begin to complain. There\u2019s no time limit on the bike rentals; just make sure to return them before closing time. Therefore, I had the sneaky suspicion of daily crimes being committed: bike hoarding. The guilty somehow go unpunished and the victims are left waiting and frowning and finally surrendering and resorting to jogging, which as you know isn\u2019t as much fun. But wait! There are suddenly more bikes for rental! Someone got the message, or maybe the habitual riders simply got bored and moved onto something else. In any event, I snagged my first bike yesterday and \u2026 woosh. The bikes are pretty basic, no gears to shift, but they\u2019re well-maintained and the land is flat. That makes the pedaling smooth and the path ahead is open. The absence of tourists on the property means you can ride in the spacious parking lot, or on the road, or along a walking trail down by the lake (watch out for snakes). In the past few days I\u2019ve seen referees on bikes, players on bikes (couldn\u2019t exactly make out their faces; they whizzed by), coaches on bikes, general managers on bikes. There\u2019s no speed limit and even so, nobody is around to enforce it and few humans to crash into. And so grown men and women are zooming around, working off stress or that day\u2019s dinner, starting at dawn and ending around sunset. My ride was carefree and wonderful, a chance to explore and forget momentarily why I was here. The last time I rode a bike was when I taught my daughter; she\u2019s now 22 so you can do the math. But, as they say: You never forget how. The first few pedals were wobbly; minutes later, they were Lance Armstrong-like. The grip on the handle bars never felt more secure. The still wind and stifling humidity suddenly disappeared. I felt for the soul who was sitting back at the rental place, waiting his turn. The bike is now part of my routine. Maybe not daily; there\u2019s work to be done. But when time permits and the muscles allow, the bike will be my escape. At least in theory. Because here at the NBA campus, sealed off from the outside, no matter how long or fast you pedal, you can only travel so far. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It was Gobert, at least the theory goes, who exposed Mitchell to Covid-19 when the NBA shut down on March 11. Or maybe Mitchell had the virus first and infected Gobert. Whatever the case, that possible transmission caused a rift that famously simmered during the four-month hiatus. Neither will deny that. But usually in such cases, one incident may not be the sole reason for so much ill will. Perhaps the buildup was juiced by Mitchell\u2019s dominance of the ball? That\u2019s the whisper, anyway. I f so, and regardless of what Gobert and Mitchell think of each other personally, their on-court chemistry is all that matters. And in this prickly situation, for the well-being of the Jazz and their hopes of going deep into the playoffs, this is where Mike Conley comes in. Remember him? Remember the veteran point guard obtained from the Memphis Grizzlies last offseason who was supposed to relieve Mitchell of the ball and decide who gets it? Since arriving from Memphis, Conley either hasn\u2019t received enough of an opportunity in this system to be the true point guard, or never maximized the chance when he did. Perhaps it\u2019s a bit of both as his transition can politely be described as disappointing. He then reached rock-bottom with a brief run at midseason as a reserve. While Mitchell is the undeniable force on this team, might Conley be the basketball intermediary needed between lukewarm teammates and the key to Utah\u2019s reboot? In this strangely interrupted NBA season, you can get a second chance to make a first impression, and Conley says thank goodness for that. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be a lot better for this team and hopefully they\u2019re see a different me.\u201d It\u2019s unusual how ball-sharing can possibly be a subject for a franchise once led by John Stockton, the NBA\u2019s all-time assists leader . Yet, aside from a handful of All-Star seasons by Deron Williams, the Jazz haven\u2019t been in secure hands at that position since Stockton retired. A pass-first point guard is now nearly extinct in today\u2019s NBA, although a pass-minded point guard is always welcomed. Utah put the ball in Mitchell\u2019s hands two years ago partly out of necessity. As a rookie, he commanded respect for his talent. That, and the reality that Utah thought Mitchell was a better option than Ricky Rubio made him the primary ball-handler \u2014 even though he wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t a true point guard. The Jazz still had some lingering doubts. Why would they trade for Conley, who never played off the ball in 12 years with Memphis?The Conley-Mitchell collaboration was heavily anticipated prior to the season yet never really materialized as imagined. Conley shot 32.3% in October, 37.4% in November and never rose above 44.7% in any month since. He was also averaging less than five assists when troubled by a persistent hamstring injury that caused him to miss 23 games and prompted Jazz coach Quin Snyder to bring Conley off the bench from Jan. 1-29 while giving Mitchell back the ball. (Conley resumed his starting role on Feb. 1 and hasn\u2019t let go of it since.) Through it all, Conley never complained or issued blame, therefore staying true to his reputation for being a professional. \u201cI would describe it as a big adjustment that I thought I had a handle on going in, but it turned out to be just like being a rookie again,\u201d he said. \u201cLearning a new city, new team, different people and personalities, different system and different role. Everything was a change and it took me some time. Then before the Covid hit I was playing some of the best ball I\u2019ve played.\u201d Gobert is the league\u2019s premier defensive big man, a seven-foot swatsman who is again in the running for Kia Defensive Player of the Year. He has worked on his post moves and mid-range jumper in hopes of proving he can be a secondary option and maybe have some plays drawn for him. Did Mitchell, who averaged just 4.2 assists in 34.4 minutes this season, have an epiphany and hear Gobert\u2019s plea during the hiatus? Asked what type of player he wants to be in this reboot, the All-Star guard didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cA more willing passer,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cTake the shots I can get but also find my teammates to get them easier looks, which will then come back and make it easier on myself.\u201d In a perfect world here, Conley will return and inspire his teammates and Snyder and gain more confidence in them. His play will command more minutes and he\u2019ll control the ball as much as Mitchell, maybe more.  Conley said: \u201cI\u2019m a guy who wants to fit in. I want our run to be perfect. So I wasn\u2019t trying to be overbearing, wasn\u2019t trying to get the ball and do things. But I still have to find my spaces where I can get aggressive and I can have an impact. When you do make the sacrifice it can look negative, like you\u2019re taking a step back instead of letting everyone else on your team function well.\u201d A more aggressive and bolder Conley would be a boost since Utah\u2019s restart will take place without Bojan Bogdanovic (wrist surgery) and his 20.2 ppg. The ball must find the open man and hot hand. If Utah\u2019s scrimmages here are any indication, Mitchell and Gobert are buying into that. \u201cBoth Rudy and Donovan are learning every game, every practice how to play better together,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIn Donovan\u2019s case, I feel great about what he\u2019s doing and what he\u2019s doing with Rudy and with all the guys on our team. We\u2019ve got an unbelievably unselfish team.\u2019\u2019 For those who suspect there\u2019s a thawing between Mitchell and Gobert, Conley doesn\u2019t believe this situation ever fit the perception. \u201cI have not seen a thing nor have I paid attention to it,\u201d Conley said. \u201cIt\u2019s that good, that seamless, between them. To be on the court with the two of them, and we\u2019re all hanging out afterward in the dining room eating together, it\u2019s all normal, no friction, no tension. Both of those guys are two of the most competitive guys on our team. They\u2019re leaders. They know they need each other and they want to win, whatever it takes. It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m expecting those guys to go out there like they normally do, play for each other, be unselfish. \u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of arguments in Memphis with Tony Allen, Marc Gasol, Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, we all go through that spell, you ride with each other for so many years, you have a situation where you go at one another to push each other. It\u2019s normal in basketball, normal in life. It\u2019s just so public in this game.\u201d Gobert and Donovan are saying all the right things, confirming the chemistry they\u2019ve shown in the scrimmages. \u201c People (on the outside) didn \u2019 t have much to talk about for months \u2014 that was kind of the topic of the moment. But we \u2019 re trying to do anything for the team,\u201d Gobert said recently. \u201c We \u2019 re trying to make plays for one another \u2014 passing to one another, screening, communicating on defense \u2014 just try to do all the little things to help the team. \u201cAs long as we respect one another and we both share the same goals and we both do what\u2019s best for the team, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In the West, looks to me like the Lakers, Clippers and Nuggets have not just deep rosters but the most versatility for various match-ups and assertive looks. That doesn\u2019t mean I think every coach will use 10 or 11 guys on a nightly basis once the postseason begins, but I do think the teams cited above won\u2019t need to tighten rotations, say, to seven trustworthy players. We\u2019ve seen what the Raptors\u2019 bench did a year ago, for instance, and the Clippers have two guys in the running for Kia Sixth Man (not sure that\u2019s mathematically possible, but what the heck). Boston\u2019s got numbers but not so much at the rim. LeBron makes anybody\u2019s ninth man better. The Bucks are as kumbaya top to bottom as it gets. And Denver\u2019s wealth of young talent buzzing around Nikola Jokic is undeniable. Shaun Powell :  Hard to argue with the Clippers\u2019 depth when twin Kia Sixth Man of the Year candidates Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams are coming off the bench. The Nuggets are bringing the numbers, too, along with the Bucks, Celtics and Heat. Those are the only teams dripping with a high level of flexibility that will allow them to tweak the rotation to their favor depending on the opponent. I\u2019m just hoping the Nuggets find the need to throw Bol Bol into the mix. Mainly because I want to write that name \u2014 Bol Bol. Bol Bol. Bol Bol! John Schuhmann : Assuming they get everybody back and healthy, the Clippers are clearly the deepest team. When the season was suspended, 44% of their points and 46% of their minutes, both the highest rates in the league, had come from reserves . And that\u2019s with Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson having played just 12 and nine games with the Clips , respectively. Even if Joakim Noah doesn\u2019t have much of a role behind Ivica Zubac and Montrezl Harrell, Doc Rivers has 10 guys he\u2019ll likely trust in a playoff series (or at the start of a series, at least). Denver has enough depth that Michael Malone can yank Michael Porter Jr. after one or two defensive breakdowns and still go nine deep with his rotation. And don\u2019t overlook the Bucks\u2019 ensemble. There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re 53-12 with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton each averaging fewer than 31 minutes per game .  Sekou Smith : All of the drama in the bubble before the seeding games even start has forced me to rethink my theory about the Clippers being as deep a contender as we\u2019ve seen in recent years. They need their full rotation in the fold before they can be fully evaluated. I\u2019m convinced another team has the most complete depth chart in the bubble. The Raptors have the sort of reliable depth that the Clippers still have to prove exists on their roster. The Raptors can come at you in waves and with size, shooting and playmaking that has proved effective at a championship level. They\u2019ll have something to say about who comes out of the East. The Bucks, of course, belong in the conversation. They also possess the quality depth and cohesion that every contender is looking for. Denver is another team overloaded with young talent (Michael Porter Jr. and Bol Bol on the court with Nikola Jokic someday is a wicked thought). And the Heat can go deep into the rotation and not see a significant drop off. Michael C. Wright : The Clippers have some folks out dealing with personal matters, but they should all be back when the important games commence. They\u2019ve got serious depth when you think about players like Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell and Landry Shamet coming off the bench. Don\u2019t sleep on the Lakers, either, with Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Markief Morris and Dwight Howard as well as Rajon Rondo, who should be back sometime during the playoffs. Miami and Utah\u2019s benches are fairly deep too, but I\u2019m actually pretty interested in what happens with the 76ers if they bring Al Horford off the bench."},{"id":26802,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-sleepers-east-west-restart","date":"2020-07-28","title":"Blogtable: Who are East & West sleeper teams in playoffs?","content":" * * * Your sleeper teams in the East and West for these upcoming playoffs?   * * * Steve Aschburner : Miami in the East, Portland in the West. Designating \u201csleeper teams\u201d requires some parameters, doesn\u2019t it? Are we talking about teams that aren\u2019t considered serious title contenders, but could really mess up a bracket? Or would that be a \u201cspoiler?\u201d Whatever \u2026 the Heat are so well coached and tied together that I think they\u2019re capable of reaching the East finals and scaring their opponents there. They\u2019ve already surpassed many folks\u2019 expectations by sitting fourth in the East, no reason to stop now. They added players not long before the shutdown, too, such as Jae Crowder and Andre Iguodala to tighten up defensively. As for Portland, everyone sees how much healthier they are now. And driven to make up for how sideways things went with Jusuf Nurkic out, then Zach Collins. Both are back (Rodney Hood isn\u2019t), big assets on defense. And determined Damian Lillard did some yakking about proposed restart ideas, so he should be plenty motivated now that a playoff berth is snaggable via the play-in mechanism. Shaun Powell :  In the East, I\u2019ll be curious about the Sixers and Celtics. Assuming Joel Embiid stays healthy, Philly retooled the lineup by putting Shake Milton at point guard and Ben Simmons at point forward and therefore reducing the dependance on Al Horford, who has been dreadful next to Embiid. As for Boston, I see them as a sleeper team to win it all; a healthy Kemba Walker and next-level Jason Tatum is the evidence. In the West, you\u2019d better not dismiss \u2018Melo, Dame, CJ and the Blazers  if Portland gets the eighth seed from Memphis. Of course, that would mean a first-round matchup with the Lakers \u2026 and if Jusuf Nurkic and Hassan Whiteside can negate the Lakers\u2019 height, I believe the basketball Earth might get shook. If Portland doesn\u2019t make the playoffs, scrappy OKC will ruin someone\u2019s grand plans. John Schuhmann : In regard to point differential, the Bucks have been almost twice as good as any other team in the East . So any team below them qualifies as a sleeper, and there are four very good candidates. The Raptors have the best chemistry, the Sixers have the highest ceiling (and the worst chemistry), and the Heat have been the best team ( 9-3 ) in games played within the East\u2019s top six. But, with a top-five defense and so much off-the-dribble potency , the Celtics should be the most dangerous team below Milwaukee. There\u2019s an argument for Oklahoma City being the most dangerous team below the Lakers and Clippers in the West. The Thunder had the league\u2019s third best record after Thanksgiving and they may be the healthiest team in Orlando. Their three-guard, my-turn-your-turn attack should translate well to the playoffs and a healthy Andre Roberson gives them something they\u2019ve been lacking: a big wing to guard the best players in the West.  Sekou Smith : I don\u2019t believe anyone is sleeping on the Portland Trail Blazers, so I request they be known hence forth as the West wild card team. A healthy Jusuf Nurkic paired in a jumbo frontcourt with Hassan Whiteside is intriguing. When you pair them with a dynamite backcourt like Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum and a slender Carmelo Anthony, the Trail Blazers boast a starting five that could cause problems for any team in a playoff series. They have to actually catch the Grizzlies and steal that No. 8 spot for any of it to matter. In the East, Miami serves as the team with championship components that no one talks about being in the mix. They have shooters, a one-two All-Star punch in Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, versatility and a great blend of up-and-coming youngsters and veteran leadership. They play with a collective edge that usually serves the franchise well and Erik Spoelstra is easily one of the most underappreciated coaches in NBA history. Michael C. Wright : I\u2019ll limit myself to the teams we know that are already in, otherwise New Orleans or Memphis might be my picks in the West. In the East, give me the Miami Heat. They go into the seeding games sitting at 41-24, good for fourth in the conference. They recently got back Bam Adebayo and Kendrick Nunn, and they\u2019ve got plenty of solid outside shooting. Defensively, any lineup including Adebayo, Butler and Andre Iguodala could be stifling. In the West, I like Oklahoma City as a sleeper because of what the Thunder have been able to do behind Chris Paul in clutch situations. That comeback against Philadelphia on Sunday showed OKC\u2019s clutch gene remains active. Plus, I\u2019m a sucker for feel-good stories, and I think we may see one emerge with Andre Roberson, who knocked down a couple of clutch 3-pointers against the 76ers despite having not played since early 2018."},{"id":26781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-state-harden-westbrook-rockets","date":"2020-07-28","title":"Blogtable: State of Rockets after season hiatus?","content":" * * * Did the four-month shutdown help or hurt Russell Westbrook, James Harden and the Houston Rockets?   * * * Steve Aschburner : I see no reason why it would hurt them more than any other team, and perhaps a theory on why the shutdown might have helped them. Given the transformation of that Rockets squad, in adapting to Westbrook and then playing bigs-less, that was a lot with which to get comfortable on the fly of the 82-game regular season. This Big Pause of the pandemic postponement may have allowed Mike D\u2019Antoni, his staff and his players to catch their collective breath and at least visualize how they might better play together in this current permutation. I still think they\u2019ve stripped themselves of one option on offense, putting even more stress on their basket attacks and deep balls. So I don\u2019t consider Houston to be a serious championship threat. But I do think, when it\u2019s all done, the break will be seen as having helped them. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019d say it helped them. James Harden, on fire from November through January, looked gassed after the All-Star break; that\u2019s about three months earlier than usual for him. And the Rockets were working out the kinks of their small-ball approach. So now, Harden gets new life and legs and the Rockets likely have a better grip on their new identity, with Russ all but abandoning the 3-point shot on a team that lives and dies with those. This isn\u2019t to suggest Houston is now in the championship mix, but perhaps no longer looked upon as first-round roadkill. John Schuhmann : It\u2019s impossible to know how four months off will affect any of these teams, but it\u2019s not hard to look on the bright side for the Rockets. With their switch-happy scheme , they really need to be cohesive on defense, so it might take some time for them to be at their best (which isn\u2019t that bad, really) on that end of the floor. But that second-ranked offense relies heavily on individual talent and, if James Harden is healthy and rested, the Rockets will be a problem for opposing defenses. The layoff has seemingly allowed Mike D\u2019Antoni, architect of some great after-timeout plays and maybe the best offensive coach in NBA history, time to tinker with a style of play (no centers, fewer ball screens) that they adopted mid-season. Westbrook will continue to attack relentlessly and other guys are always going to get open looks, but a little more ball movement ( their first two scrimmages have produced two of their 11 highest assist-percentage marks of the season) could produce better shots for Harden.  Sekou Smith : The time off had to help the Rockets . They looked like a worn down bunch right before the hiatus, no doubt a product of the season\u2019s grind and the switch to a small-ball regular lineup. Rest for the players, the introspective study time for D\u2019Antoni and his staff and the opportunity for all of them to reboot emotionally and mentally surely has to work in their favor. That said, I don\u2019t think the time off changes their championship calculus. Their deficiencies against certain teams won\u2019t change. Harden and Westbrook will still have to perform at galactic level for this team to disrupt all things L.A. once the playoffs begin. Are they capable? Sure. Am I ready to designate them as the championship wild card team? Not exactly. I need to see more in the seeding games and where they end up in the standings. Michael C. Wright : We saw stories about a slimmed-down Harden in better shape before the teams arrived at Walt Disney World, but I\u2019m still a little skeptical of Harden, even a day after the man racked up 31 points on 7-of-15 shooting in 36 minutes against the Grizzlies. So, for me, the verdict is still out on Harden , who actually looks much sharper than expected. But Westbrook clearly struggled in his first scrimmage after his arrival to the NBA bubble. When the league first went on hiatus, it seemed like Houston was finally starting to master the Harden-Westbrook dynamic. Westbrook hit 20 of 36 in those games with 14 rebounds, 11 assists and 51 points. Understandably, Westbrook was rusty in his first game back in Orlando, hitting 3 of 14 for eight points and six rebounds. Clearly, the layoff didn\u2019t help Westbrook, but I\u2019m not sure it benefitted Harden either."},{"id":26796,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lebron-james-best-shot-fourth-title","date":"2020-07-28","title":"Blogtable: Is this LeBron James' best (or last) shot at a fourth title?","content":" * * * Is this LeBron\u2019s best\/last shot at a fourth NBA title?   * * * Steve Aschburner : Not so sure about \u201clast,\u201d but I think this is the best shot he\u2019ll have at winning a fourth ring. This is such an unusual, distraction-laden situation, playing into October in this \u201cbubble\u201d environment, with nothing resembling home court or partisan fans, that James\u2019 Terminator-like laser focus should be enough to get the Lakers to The Finals. Then, whichever team comes out of the East will be significant underdogs IMO, and not nearly as good as five of the six teams that hung losses on LBJ\u2019s 3-6 Finals ledger. Only the 2011 Mavericks were on part with this year\u2019s East representative, whomever it is, and that Dallas team beat a far less experienced James crew. Shaun Powell :  Yes, yes. The Lakers are entering this restart as a strong favorite mainly because LeBron and Anthony Davis are healthy, and they played well against the contenders right before the hiatus, and so just from that standpoint, this gives him a solid shot at a third title with a third team. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s his last shot: He can\u2019t take any of that for granted starting next season. He\u2019ll have another year of tread on his 35-year-old wheels, Davis has never stayed completely healthy in his career, and the competition will stiffen as the Bucks, Clippers, Nuggets, Celtics are all built to last and, look out, here come the revamped Warriors and Nets. John Schuhmann : It\u2019s certainly not his last shot at a championship, because the Lakers should be a contender next season. But there\u2019s a strong argument for it being his best shot from this point forward, even if the odds aren\u2019t better than 1 in 3. LeBron is 35 years old, only two players in NBA history have played as many minutes (regular season and playoffs combined), and the Western Conference should be even stronger next season. We can assume that Anthony Davis will re-sign with the Lakers in the fall, but we\u2019ll have to see how salary-cap changes affect their ability to add additional talent and have somebody else shoulder some of the playmaking duties as LeBron continues to age. He\u2019s not their only rotation player over the age of 30 and they have a Draft-pick deficit going forward.  Sekou Smith : It feels like we\u2019ve been asking this same question since 2016. It\u2019s clear to me that LeBron, no matter what the first glimpse of him in the bubble suggests, is going to play forever. However, this might be his last and best shot to win that fourth NBA title as the clear best player on his team. But if he continues to work alongside Anthony Davis in his prime, the Lakers will be contenders in the Western Conference for at least the next three seasons. LeBron has continually defied and exceeded expectations during his 17 NBA seasons. So I don\u2019t feel comfortable putting a cap on what he could do in the near future. Until I see signs of a significant drop off, I\u2019m going to continue believing that he\u2019ll be in title mix. Michael C. Wright : I\u2019ll say \u201cbest\u201d, but certainly not \u201clast\u201d shot for LeBron. How many years have the pundits tried to write off this man, who from what I can see, keeps himself in meticulous enough shape to prolong his career beyond the usual NBA life expectancy? This registers as the \u201cbest\u201d shot for LeBron because of some of the role players in the supporting cast signed to team-friendly deals such as Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo, Jared Dudley, J.R. Smith and Dion Waiters. But much of the future depends on whether Anthony Davis decides to re-sign with the Lakers. If Davis decides to re-up, LeBron will have a couple more chances to win titles. Even if Davis doesn\u2019t return, I\u2019m not still not comfortable counting out LeBron."},{"id":26788,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bench-energy-restart-season-restart","date":"2020-07-28","title":"Bench energy real and loud at NBA restart","content":" Dion Waiters took an open 3-opener and about 75 feet away, a dozen or so of his Los Angeles Lakers teammates all seemed to leap from their seats in unison. \u201cSAY CHEESE!\u201d they yelled, dragging out the last syllable for effect. At Staples Center back in Los Angeles, such a yell would have been heard by the Jack Nicholson-types in the super-expensive seats. But at the NBA restart, where the only fans inside the building are the ones wearing uniforms, that sort of enthusiasm is most definitely getting noticed. At the scrimmage games at Walt Disney World over the past few days, bench energy has been real \u2014 and often loud. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of different things that they\u2019ll be screaming,\u201d said Waiters, whose teammates were playing off his \u2018Philly Cheese\u2019 nickname with the salute they directed his way. \u201cBut it feels good. That\u2019s the only thing I got. Some guys like myself, we like to play off the crowd and their enjoyment. But the teammates, they\u2019re there, supporting you. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d There will be some crowd-noise elements when the seeding games \u2014 essentially the resumption of the regular season \u2014 begin Thursday night. Music will blare and the 17-foot video boards surrounding three sides of the courts in each arena will even sometimes show real fans who logged in to \u201ccheer\u201d for their team. But the biggest source of cheerleading will come from the benches, and some coaches are even encouraging players not in the game to be active that way. \u201cTo reference that and try to coach it and try to praise it, it\u2019s on my mind,\u201d Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. \u201cTo ignore it and not reference it, I don\u2019t do that.\u201d Brown\u2019s 76ers had the NBA\u2019s best home record this season, going 29-2 in games at Wells Fargo Center. He\u2019d love to see his players replicate that energy in all the neutral-site games that will be played the rest of the way this season. \u201cYou have to decide where you want to spend your money and that one is important to me,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about our spirit enduring. Anything you can do to help that \u2014 point it out, praise it, coach it \u2014 is on my mind.\u201d When Deandre Ayton of the Phoenix Suns made a 3-pointer in a scrimmage on Sunday against Boston, something he\u2019s never done in a \u201creal\u201d game during his two NBA seasons, some of his teammates leaped over the video board at the corner of their bench and onto the floor in celebration. Hours later, in that same bench area for the next game, Carmelo Anthony of the Portland Trail Blazers spent much of the fourth quarter leaning on the top of that video screen and barking out encouragement. And when little-used players get a chance to score in these scrimmages, their teammates have made sure they hear the instant celebration. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought, for the most part, benches do that anyway,\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cI just think you don\u2019t notice it because the fans are making so much noise. But good teams\u2019 benches are alive, very active, very verbal \u2014 probably too verbal sometimes.\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the bench activity can help what\u2019s happening on the court and has encouraged the Heat to \u201cbe mindful\u201d of those situations. \u201cWhen the energy or momentum swings, you don\u2019t want it to be quiet,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe need to be intentional about doing that.\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said he isn\u2019t sure if the bench energy \u2014 and the volume \u2014 will remain cranked when the games start counting later this week. But he likes that players already have a clear understanding that the energy that often comes from crowds, whether they\u2019re cheering or booing, will have to come now from a much smaller group. Rivers is certain of one thing: Games won\u2019t seen quiet, no matter what. \u201cI think the NBA will keep figuring out ways of creating noise,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI know they don\u2019t want to hear the coaches yelling. So, if I\u2019m them, I would create more noise.\u201d"},{"id":26809,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/scrimmage-roundup-july-27","date":"2020-07-27","title":"NBA Scrimmages Roundup: Day 6 from Orlando","content":"All 22 teams participating in the NBA Restart will play three scrimmages before game action officially tips off on July 30. The NBA will be using 10-minute quarters instead of the usual 12 minutes for each team\u2019s first game. The second and third games for each team will feature regulation quarters of 12 minutes. Previous Roundups: July 26 | July 25 | July 24 | July 23 | July 22  Below are game recaps from all games played on July 27: * * * The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Washington Wizards, 123-116, in a scrimmage from Orlando on Monday afternoon. While there were five ties and five lead changes in the first quarter alone, Los Angeles held the lead for the final three quarters of action. However, the game stayed within a seven-point margin for all but a handful of minutes, with the Lakers riding a 37-30 third quarter to the victory. Los Angeles shot 49 percent from the field and 46 percent from three-point range. The Lakers also out-rebounded the Wizards, 48-42, while recording 12 steals.  Rui Hachimura led the Wizards with 19 points, three rebounds and three assists. Jerome Robinson paced the bench with 18 points, four rebounds and three assists. Ish Smith also provided 12 points, five rebounds and six assists off the pine.  With LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma, Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard resting, Alex Caruso led the Lakers\u2019 starters with 17 points, five rebounds, six assists and three steals. J.R. Smith led the team in scoring, dropping 20 points off the bench and knocking down six of his seven attempts from three. Dion Waiters also came off the bench to tally 18 points, three rebounds and six assists.  This was the final scrimmage for both teams, which now turn their attention toward the eight seeding games, which begin Thursday night. The Lakers face the Clippers on Thursday, while Washington squares off against the Suns on Friday. \u2014 By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire * * * The Sacramento Kings rallied for a 106-102 comeback victory against the Los Angeles Clippers at Orlando on Thursday in the NBA Season Restart Scrimmage finale for both teams. The Kings overcame a 21-point third-quarter deficit by outscoring the Clippers, 33-19, in the fourth quarter. The Kings didn\u2019t take the lead for good until Nemanja Bjelica hit his only shot of the day \u2014 a 3-pointer with 27 seconds remaining to go ahead 102-100, as Los Angeles led 40 of the first 44 minutes. Bogdan Bogdanovic led the Kings with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists. De\u2019Aaron Fox made his return from an ankle injury with 12 points, four rebounds and six assists, while Buddy Hield led the bench with 17 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The Kings held the Clippers to just 36 percent from the field and 28 percent from 3-point range. Paul George, who posted 19 points, four rebounds and three assists led the Clippers. Kawhi Leonard scored 17 points, and Marcus Morris finished with 18 points and five rebounds. Reggie Jackson added 11 points, four rebounds and five assists. The Clippers open the restart regular-season Thursday against the Los Angeles Lakers, while the Kings play the San Antonio Spurs. \u2014 By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire * * * The Utah Jazz held off the Brooklyn Nets, 112-107 , in the NBA Season Restart Scrimmage finale for both teams at Orlando on Monday. The Jazz led almost the whole way, going ahead at the 7:27 mark of the first quarter, but the Nets made it a game in the fourth quarter. Trailing 84-72 entering the final period, the Nets cut the lead to two, 105-103, with 1:55 to play but could get no closer. The Nets hurt themselves at the foul line where they went 13 for 27 (48.1 percent). Utah scored 23 points from the free-throw line (on 32 attempts, 71.9 percent) and held an advantage on the boards, 54-45. Rudy Gobert led the way for the Jazz with 20 points, adding seven rebounds and a block. Mike Conley scored 18 points, and Donovan Mitchell finished with 14 points, four rebounds, four assists and a steal. Jordan Clarkson led the bench with 12 points, five rebounds and a steal.

Rodions Kurucs produced a bench-leading 13 points and six rebounds, while Tyler Johnson scored 11 points in 17 minutes. The Jazz open the restart regular season Thursday against the New Orleans Pelicans, while the Nets play Friday against Orlando Magic. \u2014 By Juan Carlos Blanco * * * The Orlando Magic defeated the Denver Nuggets, 114-110 , on Monday in a scrimmage from Orlando. The score might have been extremely close, but it\u2019s fair to say the Magic were in control of the game from start to finish. The Nuggets\u2019 biggest edge was by just one point during the first quarter. Orlando built a big lead in the first half and didn\u2019t take its foot off the gas after a 29-19 first quarter, outpacing Denver by as much as 21 points early in the second quarter. The first half ended with an 11-point lead for the Magic, but Denver didn\u2019t give up the rest of the way. They only reduced Orlando\u2019s advantage late in the fourth quarter \u2014 although they did win the third quarter by a 32-29 score \u2014 but by that time, it was too late to turn things around. The Nuggets got as close as four points with a few seconds left in the fourth, but that\u2019s the closest they\u2019d get. The Magic closed things out and escaped with the win. Six Orlando players scored in double digits, led by Gary Clark, who ended with 17 points. James Ennis III and Terrence Ross had 15 points apiece, while D.J. Augustin and Jonathan Isaac each chipped in with 13 points off the bench. Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with a 23-point, four-rebound, four-assist performance, while Nikola Jokic went scoreless in his return to center. Paul Millsap notched 13 points with six boards and three dimes. This game was the final scrimmage for both teams. The Magic will resume their regular-season campaign Friday against the Brooklyn Nets, while Denver will play Saturday against the Miami Heat. \u2014 By Juan Aravena, RotoWire * * * The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 124-103 , on Monday in the NBA Season Restart Scrimmage finale for both teams at Orlando. Trailing 53-50 at halftime, the Pelicans dominated the second half, outscoring the Bucks 40-28 in the third quarter and 34-22 in the fourth quarter to run away with it. JJ Redick came up big for the Pelicans with 20 points, shooting 4-of-7 from 3-point range in 15 minutes off the bench. Jaxson Hayes added 17 points, and Frank Jackson totaled 16 points. The Pelicans shot 45 percent from the field, including 36 percent from deep. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 30 points, eight rebounds and three assists. Khris Middleton added 16 points, eight rebounds and four assists, while Ersan Ilyasova added 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Bucks shot 39 percent from the field and 26 percent from long range. The Bucks will restart the regular season with a matchup against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Pelicans restart their season against the Utah Jazz on Thursday. \u2014 By Dan Bruno, RotoWire * * *"},{"id":26786,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lou-williams-10-day-quarantine","date":"2020-07-27","title":"Clippers' Lou Williams in 10-day quarantine after returning to Orlando","content":" ORLANDO \u2014 For the first time in league history, a player is guaranteed to miss an official NBA game for quarantine. Perhaps it was inevitable here at the Disney campus, where 22 teams involving 300-plus players are camped together, their freedom to move about severely restricted. Some may leave Orlando for family emergencies or other reasons, and under that umbrella, Lou Williams of the Clippers was excused Thursday when he flew home to Atlanta. However, after attending a viewing for the death of a close family friend, Williams admitted to NBA security that he went to Magic City, a local strip club, later that night. The league was initially suspicious when Jack Harlow, a rapper, posted a picture of him and Williams \u2014 wearing an NBA-issued facemask \u2014 at the club on social media Thursday before deleting it. When that went viral, Williams went to social media to clarify: \u201cAsk any of my teammates what\u2019s my favorite restaurant in Atlanta is. Ain\u2019t nobody partying. Chill out lol. #Maskon #inandout.\u201d Regardless, his detour will cost him 10 days in quarantine instead of the four he would\u2019ve received had he limited his visit to the wake. That means Williams will miss the Clippers\u2019 first two seeding games, including the opener Thursday against the Lakers; his quarantine period began Saturday. It was a breach of good-faith that rankled some in the Clippers organization. Coach Doc Rivers said: \u201cYou know, obviously those (pictures) got out, and that\u2019s something that we obviously didn\u2019t enjoy seeing or like.\u201d On Monday, Williams addressed the reason he had to leave the NBA campus, saying: \u201cI went home to see a man off to his final resting place that was a giant in my life. I don\u2019t want that to get lost in all this attention. So again, LONG LIVE THE GREAT PAUL WILLIAMS SR. Back to my quarantine so I can join the guys soon. Peace.\u201d The Clippers have yet to put a complete team on the Disney courts for practice because of quarantine or pre-Disney positive tests. Ivica Zubac and Landry Shamet were no-shows at the start while Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley were excused to leave the campus in Orlando to tend to family matters in the past week. The Clippers have dealt with this level of incompletion for much of the season. Paul George and Kawhi Leonard have missed chunks of the schedule for injury recovery and rest, while Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson arrived just before the season was suspended. Joakim Noah has yet to play a game. Along with Harrell, Williams is once again a prime contender for the league\u2019s Sixth Man Award. What troubles the Clippers about this episode is that Williams, at age 33, is one of the team\u2019s veterans and leaders. It promises to be an interesting stretch for the league and its players during a confinement that will last two or three months for the very best teams. One player violated the spirit of the campus, and the games haven\u2019t even begun yet. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

They get back in transition, work hard to get around screens, bring help when needed, make the next rotation, protect the rim, avoid fouling, and gang rebound. The Magic are as fundamentally sound defensively as any team in the league, suffering few breakdowns over the course of 48 minutes. And they\u2019re consistent in more ways than one. In the middle of the standings, they\u2019ve consistently struggled against the teams at the top and consistently taken care of business against the teams at the bottom. The Magic have the league\u2019s biggest differential between their winning percentage in games against the 17 teams under .500 (25-9, .735) and their winning percentage in games against the 13 teams with winning records (5-26, .161). Similarly, their fundamentally-sound defense hasn\u2019t held up against the league\u2019s best offenses. While the Magic have had the fifth best defense (allowing just 105.6 points per 100 possessions) against the team\u2019s that currently rank 11-30 in offensive efficiency , they rank 21st defensively (allowing 114.0) against the top 10. The only teams with a bigger differential in that regard are the teams \u2014 Cleveland and Golden State \u2014 that finished with the league\u2019s two worst records. Like most defenses these days, the Magic drop their bigs back in pick-and-roll coverage, hoping to prevent the most efficient shots on the floor. The result is only 29.8% of their opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s fifth lowest opponent rate, coming in the restricted area. That number has been only a tick higher for the top 10 offenses (30.2%) than it\u2019s been for the bottom 20 offenses (29.5%) against the Magic. Preventing layups and dunks while also avoiding fouls is a good formula. The only other team that ranks in the top five in both opponent free throw rate and the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come in the restricted area is the Milwaukee Bucks, who have been the league\u2019s best defensive team by a wide margin. Both teams also rank in the top five in defensive rebounding percentage . The structure, the discipline, and the effort are there for the Magic. That will get you wins against the NBA\u2019s lesser teams and make things more difficult for the best. Good defense starts in transition. League-wide, effective field goal percentage is highest (60%) in the first six seconds of the shot clock. Prevent those shots and you\u2019ve taken a big step toward getting a stop. According to Synergy play-type tracking, only 13.6% of the Magic\u2019s opponents\u2019 possessions, the league\u2019s lowest rate , have been in transition. They\u2019ve been an average offensive rebounding team, but generally have just one guy crashing the glass and have great habits \u2013 quick reactions and persistent effort \u2014 in regard to getting back on defense. Play 1. Markelle Fultz, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic are all under the basket when Jaylen Brown grabs the rebound. But Fultz races back to pick up the ball and Evan Fournier helps in the paint when Fultz can\u2019t make Brown change direction. Gordon is there when Brown kicks out to Romeo Langford in the right corner and Fultz begins his \u201cX out\u201d out to Jayson Tatum before Langford has even swung the ball. Brown grabs the offensive board, but the Magic successfully defend two isolations and Gordon Hayward misses a pull-up mid-range jumper. Number to know: The Magic have allowed a league-low 11.1 second-chance points per game. Play 2. After Tatum steals the ball from Vucevic, Terrence Ross slows up the break a bit. But Tatum lofts a pass over both Ross and Fournier. Gary Clark meets Vincent Poirier in the paint and Carter-Williams races back to block Hayward from behind. Number to know: The 1.09 points per possession the Magic have allowed on transition possessions rank 11th . Play 3. Fultz misses a contested layup and Vucevic goes for the offensive rebound. But the Magic still have four guys back (including Fultz and Ross, who was in the far corner) before Eric Bledsoe begins his attack. Gordon stays in front of Bledsoe, holds him up, and the fifth guy (Vucevic) gets all the way back to block the shot. Number to know: The Magic lineup of Fultz, Fournier, Ross, Gordon and Vucevic has allowed just 3.9 fast break points per 48 minutes, the fewest among 88 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes. The Magic also have two of the other five lineups that have played at least 100 minutes and allowed fewer than 9.0 fast break points per 48. Play 4. All five Magic defenders get back and Carter-Williams stays in front of Donte DiVincenzo. Vucevic still brings help from the weak-side corner and Wes Iwundu rotates down to intercept DiVincenzo\u2019s kick-out pass to Brook Lopez. Number to know: The Magic are one of five teams that rank in the top 10 in three of the four factors on defense. They\u2019re the only one of the five for which opponent turnover percentage (in which they rank 10th ) isn\u2019t the only exception. Play 5. After a Carter-Williams miss, the Heat push and Duncan Robinson has the ball in the corner with just three seconds having expired on the shot clock. But James Ennis meets him there to prevent the quick 3-pointer. Number to know: Only 13.6% of the Magic\u2019s opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s fourth lowest rate, have come in the first six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. The Magic\u2019s defensive effort doesn\u2019t stop after they stop the break. In sending extra defenders to the paint to prevent layups, they can expose themselves on the perimeter. But they don\u2019t leave shooters open for long and guys know that, if they leave their man or get beat off the dribble, a teammate will have their back. Play 1. Carter-Williams applies pressure and goes over a Brown\/Enes Kanter pick-and-roll. Brown engages Vucevic in his drop coverage, but Gordon sinks off the weak-side corner and intercepts Brown\u2019s lob to Kanter. Number to know: The Magic have forced just 13.5 turnovers per 100 possessions with Gordon on the floor, but 16.7 with him off the floor . Play 2. When Hayward gets into the paint via a screen from Grant Williams, Vucevic slides over to stop the drive. And when Hayward kicks out to Williams in the corner, Fultz sells out to run Williams off the 3-point line. Both Vucevic and Gordon rotate down to stop Williams\u2019 drive, Ross rotates over to Tatum, and both Gordon and Fultz scramble to the weak side. Hayward swings the ball back to an open Tatum, but Vucevic closes out and forces a tough, side-step 3-pointer. Number to know: 14.5% of the Magic\u2019s opponents\u2019 shots have come in the last six seconds of the shot clock. That rate is just below the league average (14.6%). Play 3. Iwundu and Fournier switch a Hayward cross-screen for Brown. Kanter goes the other way for a dribble-hand-off and Vucevic stops Tatum\u2019s drive. Brown attacks Iwundu\u2019s close-out, Vucevic helps to the strong-side block, and Fournier sinks down to box out Kanter. Number to know: The Magic have two of the 10 lineups \u2014 Fultz, Fournier, Gordon and Vucevic with either Iwundu or Khem Birch \u2014 that have played 100 minutes or more and grabbed at least 80% of available defensive rebounds. Play 4. A Hayward\/Kanter pick-and-roll has Iwundu trailing, Vucevic stepping up to stop another drive, and Fultz sinking off the weak-side corner to tag Kanter\u2019s roll. Fultz recovers to run Langford off the line on the kick-out. When he gets beat baseline, Iwundu leaves Hayward and takes the ball away from the rookie. Number to know: 56.3% of Orlando opponent turnovers, the league\u2019s third highest opponent rate, have been live-ball turnovers (Magic steals). Play 5. One possession after giving up a Tatum 3-pointer on the same action , the Magic switch a Tatum back-screen for Brown on the right side. Brown comes back for the ball, backs Fournier down to the right block and is met by Carter-Williams (who leaves Tatum) on a spin baseline. Ross rotates down to Tatum in the left corner and Birch rotates out to Brad Wanamaker on the swing, forcing a mid-range pull-up. Number to know: Carter-Williams\u2019 2.1 steals per 36 minutes rank eighth among 286 players that have played at least 750 minutes. The Orlando defense is relatively aggressive in loading up to the strong side defensively. One unique thing they do is set traps along the sideline when there\u2019s not a shooter in the strong-side corner. When the trap is set, they\u2019ll bring extra defenders to the strong side, so that the only available pass (when they\u2019re positioned the way they want to be) is over the top to the other side of the floor. Play 1. Kristaps Porzingis gives the ball back to Luka Doncic and sets a screen for Doncic to get to the middle of the floor. Gordon goes under the screen and is ready to meet Doncic on the other side, so Doncic goes back the other way. Vucevic steps up to prevent the pull-up 3-pointer, Gordon trails to trap along the sideline, and Fultz leaves his man to prevent the escape-valve pass to Porzingis. By the time Dorian Finney-Smith catches Doncic\u2019s skip pass in the left corner, the Magic are able to reset defensively. Seth Curry gets around Fultz, but misses a late-clock runner. Number to know: 18% of the Magic\u2019s opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s fourth highest rate, have been non-restricted-area shots in the paint. Play 2. After the Magic defend the Heat\u2019s initial left-side action, Bam Adebayo gets the ball to Kendrick Nunn in the corner and follows to set a screen. Fultz \u201cices\u201d that screen, forcing Nunn toward the baseline, and Vucevic meets him there to set the trap. Both Gordon and Ross immediately slide over to the strong side. Nunn steps through the trap, but Gordon intercepts his pass to Jimmy Butler. Number to know: The Magic have seen the league\u2019s third biggest jump in opponent turnover rate, from 13.1 per 100 possessions ( 21st ) last season to 15.0 per 100 ( 10th ) this season. Play 3. After Fournier switches the initial \u201cpistol\u201d screen from Robinson, he ices the same Adebayo screen for Nunn in the previous play. Nunn again rejects the screen, Vucevic stops him on the baseline and Fournier trails to set the trap. Gordon, however, never commits to pick up Adebayo, who makes an easy feed to Butler under the basket. Number to know: The Magic have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in opponent effective field goal percentage, from 51.5% ( 10th ) last season to 53.5% ( 18th ) this season. Play 4. Joakim Noah sets a screen for Kawhi Leonard along the right sideline, Vucevic steps up, and Gordon follows to set the trap in the corner. With Fournier, Ennis and D.J. Augustin sliding over to the strong side, Marcus Morris has an open lane to the basket. But Leonard\u2019s pass is high, the Magic scramble back into position, and force a contested, late-clock 3-pointer from Leonard. Number to know: The Magic have allowed just 99.1 points per 100 possessions with Augustin and Vucevic on the floor together. That\u2019s the lowest on-court mark among 35 two-man Magic combinations that have played at least 300 minutes together. Play 5. Noah sets the same, back-to-the-baseline screen for Reggie Jackson along the left sideline, Vucevic and Augustin set the trap, and Gordon leaves Leonard to pick up Noah on the strong side. But Jackson is able to get the ball back to Leonard for an open 3-pointer. Number to know: The Magic have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in opponent 3-point percentage, from 34.7% ( 10th ) last season to 37.0% ( 24th ) this season. The Magic have done well in protecting the paint, but haven\u2019t had as much success on the perimeter. While they rank 11th in opponent field goal percentage in the paint, they rank 26th in opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint. They\u2019re 29th in opponent mid-range field goal percentage (43.8%) and 24th in opponent 3-point percentage (37.0%). And that\u2019s where the Magic have struggled against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses, who have shot 45.8% from mid-range and 40.8% from beyond the arc against the Orlando defense. While the Magic limit breakdowns, they can still be beat with talent, particularly good shooting from the perimeter. Sometimes, it\u2019s simply a ball-handler stepping into an open jumper when his defender gets screened and the Orlando big sits back in the paint \u2026 Sometimes, it\u2019s just good offense beating good defense \u2026 Play 1. Fultz gets caught in a back-screen from Hayward (which Iwundu doesn\u2019t switch), but Gordon helps out from the weak side. Fournier rotates down to the weak-side corner and Fultz Xs out to the wing. He stays in front of Brown on an isolation, but Brown hits the 14-foot jumper over the top. Number to know: Overall, the league has shot 41.1% on pull-up 2-pointers. Against the Magic, the league has shot 44.1% on pull-up 2s. Play 2. On a dribble-hand-off, Fournier tags the Kanter roll and anticipates Tatum\u2019s kick-out to Brown. Vucevic provides help when Brown attacks Fournier\u2019s close-out, but Brown hits a tightly-contested, step-back jumper. Number to know: The Magic have ranked in the bottom five in opponent mid-range field goal percentage in each of Steve Clifford\u2019s two seasons in Orlando. They ranked 27th (42.0%) last season . Play 3. Gordon switches a Tatum\/Williams pick-and-roll and defends Tatum\u2019s isolation about as well as one could. Tatum still drains a step-back jumper from the top of the key. Number to know: Only 5.5% of Orlando opponent possessions, the league\u2019s sixth lowest rate , have been isolations, according to Synergy play-type tracking. The 0.94 points per possession they\u2019ve allowed on isolations rank 23rd . Play 4. The Magic build a wall when Giannis Antetokounmpo attacks down the left side of the floor, preventing the MVP from getting to the basket or to his spin move. Fournier recovers to prevent a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from Khris Middleton, and Iwundu picks up Middleton when he gets around the close-out. But one of the best mid-range shooters in the league still drains the jumper. Number to know: Magic opponents have a ratio of 2.9 3-point attempts per mid-range shot, a mark that is right at the league average. That ratio is 2.7 for the bottom 20 offenses and 3.3 for the top 10 offenses against Orlando. Play 5. Carter-Williams works hard to get around a Kelly Olynyk screen and prevent a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from Robinson, and then he keeps Robinson from getting the ball back. Augustin denies another hand-off attempt to Goran Dragic and forces Dragic to catch the ball 30 feet from the basket. When Augustin ices an Olynyk screen and Dragic goes the other way, Mo Bamba switches and stops the drive. Carter-Williams then provides just a sliver of space for Dragic to get the ball to Robinson, who drains the contested corner 3-pointer. Number to know: The Magic rank 27th in opponent corner 3-point percentage, with their opponents having shot 41.6% from the corners. Play 6. Vucevic and Gordon look to trap Butler when he uses an Adebayo screen along the right sideline. Fultz anticipates and picks off the \u201chammer\u201d pass to Robinson in the left corner, but saves the ball right back to Butler. The Magic are able to reset defensively, but Dragic squeezes a reverse layup around Ross on the baseline. Number to know: The Heat have had two of the five most efficient games (more than 124 points scored per 100 possessions) against the Magic this season. After missing the last 31 regular-season games and the Magic\u2019s first two scrimmages at Walt Disney World, Jonathan Isaac will reportedly play in a scrimmage against Denver on Monday. Isaac isn\u2019t the most consistent defender on the roster, but he certainly has the highest ceiling on that end of the floor, as his defensive highlights from a November game against the league\u2019s No. 1 offense make clear. Isaac finished with six blocks and four steals in that one-point loss in Dallas. The Magic allowed just 62 points on 65 defensive possessions (0.95 per) with him on the floor and 45 points on 36 defensive possessions (1.25 per) with him off the floor. His season-long on-off numbers aren\u2019t as dramatic, but he certainly makes the Magic a better defensive team. Eight different guys have played alongside the Magic\u2019s four healthy starters. The Magic have allowed 105.3 points per 100 possessions in 240 minutes with Isaac as the fifth guy and 113.9 per 100 in 687 minutes with somebody else in that spot. Isaac has totaled 128 steals (50) and blocks (78) , and committed just 79 personal fouls. That ratio of 1.62 ranks second (behind Butler \u2013 1.64) among 286 players that have played at least 750 minutes. His 4.0 deflections per 36 minutes rank 12th among those same 286 players. The fit with Gordon ( 30.1% from 3-point range ) and Isaac (33.0%) at the forward spots isn\u2019t ideal on offense, especially when you have a point guard who shoots even worse. But all that size and length on the frontline is tough to score against inside. In 319 minutes with Gordon, Isaac and Vucevic all on the floor, less than 26% of opponent shots have come in the restricted area. Even before the league went on hiatus for four months, the Magic had a weird season. Before the All-Star break, they ranked 27th offensively and seventh defensively . And in the three weeks between the All-Star break and when everything stopped, they ranked first offensively and 26th defensively . Given their personnel, the way they work defensively, and the sample size, there\u2019s certainly more truth in the pre-break numbers. If the Magic remain where they are or move up, this would be the fifth top-10 defense that Clifford has had in his seven seasons as head coach with Charlotte and Orlando. Only four of the Magic\u2019s eight seeding games are against teams with winning records, and only one of the eight (Aug. 9 vs. Boston) is against a team that currently ranks in the top 10 offensively. Orlando should be favored to move up to the 7 seed in the Eastern Conference, which would likely get them a matchup with the defending champs in the first round. The Magic have defended Toronto well. The 102.3 points per 100 possessions the Raptors have scored in the season series is their fourth worst mark against any opponent . Alas, in going 0-3 against the champs, the Magic have scored an anemic 92.0 per 100 ( their worst mark against any opponent ) themselves. They\u2019ll play Toronto one more time before the postseason. We don\u2019t know what to expect going forward, but we can expect that the Magic, with the way they defend, won\u2019t beat themselves. That doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be beaten. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Brooklyn Nets star is committing $1.5 million to supplement the income of players who choose not to play this season, whether it be because of coronavirus concerns or social justice reasons. The funds will come from the KAI Empowerment Initiative that Irving launched Monday. It will also provide players with a financial literacy program created by UBS. Irving said that with the help of WNBA players Natasha Cloud \u2014 who chose to sit out \u2014 and Jewell Loyd, he connected with several WNBA players who discussed with him the challenges they faced in deciding whether to play. The season began Saturday and will be played entirely at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. He decided to help with the financial burden in a league where the top annual salary is a little more than $200,000. \u201cWhether a person decided to fight for social justice, play basketball, focus on physical or mental health, or simply connect with their families, this initiative can hopefully support their priorities and decisions,\u201d Irving said in a statement. Players such as Cloud and Atlanta\u2019s Renee Montgomery opted against playing for social reform reasons, though it\u2019s unclear how many will qualify for Irving\u2019s program. To be eligible, players must provide insight into the circumstances surrounding their decision and not be receiving salary support from any other entity. An opt-out for medical reasons must be connected to the coronavirus pandemic. Players can get information at www.kaiempowermentinitiative.com . They need to apply by Aug. 11 and recipients will be notified on Aug. 24. Irving is not with the Nets for the restart of the NBA season as he recovers from shoulder surgery. He has been outspoken about social justice issues and recently produced a TV special calling for action in the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency medical technician who was shot eight times in Louisville, Kentucky, on March 13 by plainclothes officers serving a narcotics search warrant without knocking at her apartment. No drugs were found. WNBA players wore Taylor\u2019s name on their jerseys during opening weekend."},{"id":26782,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-day-13","date":"2020-07-27","title":"Disney World Diary: Dreaming of take-out, from all over the country","content":" There\u2019s some high-stakes undercover smuggling going on at the NBA campus that I\u2019m aware of but not invited to participate in. The contraband makes its way through security and is delivered discreetly and packed in small shopping bags, although it\u2019s quite possible the aroma might set off alarms. We\u2019re talking food here, sweet, succulent, savory, sensory-blasting food that cannot be found within these invisible walls. Look, bless the hearts of the cooks here; they do a tireless job. But seasoning the food, or even keeping it warm, isn\u2019t their specialty. So some people have decided to order off-campus. That comes at a price; I\u2019ve heard the delivery charge alone is $75. Which means, if you want a pulled pork sandwich from Bubbalou\u2019s Bodacious Barbecue about six miles away, it\u2019ll set you back 83 bucks. Tip not included. Because the accounting office might frown upon that, I can only dream \u2014 and therefore torture myself \u2014 of ordering takeout from some of my go-to places around the country.  I\u2019d gladly pay the $75 out of pocket if I could order from the following: Milo + Olive, Santa Monica: The sausage and kale pizza will set you back around $28 but you\u2019ll stop cursing after the first slice. And the sauteed garlic kale on the side is too delicious to be considered healthy. Hattie B\u2019s Hot Chicken, Atlanta & Nashville: Please send me an order of fried wings with medium heat, a-side-a collards and summa dat banana pudding. I\u2019ll be good. North Italia, various locales: The Tuscan kale salad is all the green I\u2019ll need, and oh well, speaking of knead, add a little white truffle garlic bread. Bandera, Chicago: Scottish salmon, broccolini and pan-seared cornbread. Wait, I hear they\u2019re closed because of COVID-19, not even offering takeout. Chicago is now the city of Slumped Shoulders. Cochon, New Orleans: Fried catfish, creamy grits and gumbo. There oughta be a law. Matt\u2019s in the Market, Seattle: Not only is the food superb, it comes with a gorgeous view of the Puget Sound, which admittedly would be tough for them to place in the takeout delivery bag. Prime 112, Miami Beach: Confession here. I\u2019ve never eaten at Prime, the go-to place for LeBron and Dwyane Wade during the \u201cBig Three\u201d era in Miami. I was too nervous about expensing that. But right now? What the hell. Norma\u2019s, New York City: The breakfast is served with high quality and a tab to match, and her hot chocolate seems straight from Willy Wonka\u2019s factory. La Barbecue, Austin, Texas : I\u2019m not big on red meat but in this part of Texas, if you don\u2019t get some of this \u2018cue, they will arrest you. Irma\u2019s Southwest, Houston: The Mexican food served up here, just a 3-point shot from the Toyota Center, is more authentic than James Harden\u2019s step-back jumper. There are many, many more menu items from establishments around the country swirling inside my head, making me dizzy, making me hungry. Therefore, I must stop now and make do with the chicken I just pulled from the rack. Someone find me a knife. Make sure it\u2019s sharp. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

That was quite a while ago, decades actually, when his muscle fibers didn\u2019t instinctively twitch when he came in close contact with the shield. Truthfully \u2014 and this may seem astonishing given the cauldron climate that exists today and historically between police and people of color \u2014 Rivers expected and received unconditional love whenever a cop followed him home and walked inside and said: \u201cHey, son.\u201d Grady Rivers was his boy\u2019s idol, for how he ran a disciplined household and taught him basketball and wore the blue uniform. The father did all of that proudly, and that resonated within Doc, and the honor and character of the man never left the son, even now, and therefore never will. Grady Rivers rose to lieutenant while serving 30 years on the force in Maywood, a largely working class Black township just west of Chicago. The father understood his role, and his level of influence, and the power he held that would never be abused. \u201cMy dad knew the difference between right and wrong,\u201d said Doc Rivers. \u201cHe was a very principled guy and I was lucky because I grew up with that. But if you did something wrong, you did it wrong and he was going to tell you that. I was the son of a cop but he said, \u2018If you do something wrong, you will be in jail. That\u2019s a guarantee and there will be no favors.\u2019 He made that clear. He told me that all the time.\u201d Fast-forward to today: Rivers is coaching the LA Clippers and so many years later there\u2019s another piece of fatherly advice that pounds away in his chest, in his soul. That seed was dormant then, yet rages now. \u201cI knew as a kid when I was going to Melrose Park and I was walking, there was a very good chance the police would pull over, stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad would tell me: \u2018Be respectful, show your hands \u2014 both of them \u2014 and talk.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018Don\u2019t tell them your dad is a police officer, because they wouldn\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t look at that, they look at you.\u2019 \u201cAnd so, he also gave me \u2018The Talk.\u2019 He told me about those other cops.\u201d Those cops were not just in Melrose Park, the next town over, which was largely white. But lately, in Minneapolis. And New York City. And Atlanta. And New Orleans. And, hell, Rivers has lost track, after the multiple incidents of beatings and brutality cases and deaths of unarmed Black men in the custody of those other cops. And so, how\u2019s the son of a cop supposed to feel, given all that? What amount of rage and frustration has smeared mustard stains over the Norman Rockwell-painted nostalgia of his youth? And why, do you suppose, is Rivers pushing and elbowing his way to the front of the line in the NBA\u2019s unified efforts to demand justice here in the scorching Summer of 2020? He, the son of a cop? No, he the human being and Black man and voice for change and reform, even before the death of George Floyd and especially afterward. \u201cWhen that happened to him, I was furious,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cThis is a humanity issue. No man should kneel on another man\u2019s neck. You don\u2019t treat another human that way, I don\u2019t care what they\u2019ve done. But some of those cops, they don\u2019t see us as humans. And this is why there\u2019s a divide between the Black community and police. There\u2019s no trust.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that way in a town of 24,000 people back in the 1970s and especially inside the modest, split-level house at 1413 S. 16th Avenue. Grady Rivers was about law and order within his home and outside the door. That said, his son recalled another, very important side to Officer Rivers: In an oath to protect and serve, the father took that last part very seriously. \u201cMy dad lived in the community,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cIf we\u2019re walking down the street, it was, \u2018Hey Sergeant Rivers, hey Mr. Rivers.\u2019 Everywhere. My dad coached the football team, basketball team and Little League baseball team. My house was full of people everyday. He was more than a cop. He was a community leader.\u201d Grady Rivers was among the adults who nourished the town\u2019s athletic potential that would bear delicious fruit. Although Maywood is small, it has produced a disproportionate amount of professional athletes, especially in hoops. Among the present and former NBA players are Jevon Carter, Shannon Brown, Michael Finley, Dee Brown and Sterling Brown. The Rivers\u2019 home became a haven for athletic-minded kids because Grady Rivers built a basketball court with lights. Kids would appear early in the morning, before Doc awakened, and often stayed well into the night, after Doc fell asleep. Hundreds of years ago, Maywood was a minor stop on the Underground Railroad. Some settled in Chicago, others kept moving to Canada. That, and the Great Migration of the 1920s and \u201830s from the South, saw an influx of Blacks in Maywood, a rare suburb that was largely Black. Slowly, Blacks also became part of the Maywood police force and one in particular saw it as his calling. There was a spirit of cooperation within the force, as far as Doc Rivers could tell, between his father and his fellow officers. Not only did they police the community, they policed each other; as a lieutenant, Grady Rivers was in charge of a group of officers. That\u2019s an issue that the son believes is missing today and is causing decay and destroying the image of the force. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to hold other people accountable, right?\u201d he said. \u201cWell, if there\u2019s 10 good police officers and one bad one, and the 10 good ones know he\u2019s doing bad and they don\u2019t turn him in, then there\u2019s 11 bad ones. That\u2019s the way I do my math. \u201cIf those 10 good ones saw a man on the street doing bad, they would arrest him. They would turn him in. But if they see one of their own doing bad, because of the police unions, they\u2019re called a snitch. Yet in real policing on the street, they have snitches to help them do their jobs and investigations. That has to be solved because this isn\u2019t going to get better until it does.\u201d Don\u2019t get Doc started, because he can\u2019t stop. \u201cThere needs to be a stronger push to give those good cops a vehicle,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than the Catholic priests; there\u2019s a lot of good ones. But there are some bad ones and when the good ones don\u2019t do something about it, they\u2019re all guilty. \u201cWe have to disband the unions. Forget defunding the police, we have to defund the unions. Because those unions are so powerful that the good cops are scared. They\u2019re too scared to tell. What if the bad cop is a lieutenant and you\u2019re a second-year cop? You\u2019re going to turn him in? Well, you better, but you don\u2019t. Until that happens we ain\u2019t changing.\u201d For Grady Rivers, being a cop in the community he served actually made the job easier and more enjoyable, and this isn\u2019t lost these days on his son. Rivers also believes all cops should be required to live and raise their families in the communities in which they serve. \u201cOne thing I see in policing is, if you\u2019re not going to be part of community, you shouldn\u2019t be a police officer,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cBe in it. If you\u2019re going to try to police people, invest in them. Because when you think about all these pull-overs where they go violent, what if you were a cop and walked to the car and said, \u2018Hey Jimmy, what are you doing speeding?\u2019 It\u2019s a whole different thing. \u201cWe care where we live. When you don\u2019t live there, you don\u2019t care as much.\u201d Not long after Grady Rivers retired, Maywood relaxed that live-where-you-work requirement and Doc believes it contributed to the rapid decline of a neighborhood that was already in the tentacles of drugs and gangs and poverty. In 2007, an unarmed motorist was shot and killed by a Maywood cop who said the man tried to run him down while fleeing a bust. Maywood settled with the slain man\u2019s family for $500,000. Three years later another Maywood cop was caught stealing money from suspects during a sting. I n 2010, Maywood \u2019 s deputy police chief allegedly pistol-whipped a teenager while off duty. Some Maywood residents have complained about being shaken down and robbed by cops ; one man sued the town after being allegedly beaten and robbed. The Better Government Association, a community watchdog group, recently investigated the conduct and patterns of the Maywood police and reached troubling conclusions. Among them: Officers with ties to street gangs and allegations that officers were selling badges and robbing residents, one of whom was an undercover FBI agent posing as a drug dealer. But Maywood is not under nationwide magnification, not like Portland, Ore., and Seattle and other cities still seeing confrontations between demonstrators and police. \u201cMy dad told his officers that our job is to be peacemakers in the community,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to mean. What I see going on now with how the police are relating to the demonstrators is terrible. This gearing up with all the armor and artillery, that\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s what you do for the army, not for a community.\u201d Grady Rivers died in 2007 and the son had a quick one-word response when asked what the father\u2019s reaction would be to the George Floyd incident: \u201cFurious.\u201d And the protests? \u201cHe would be very proud what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cMy dad would\u2019ve been out there marching. And I know the cops who were just like him want to.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The real action tips off just two days later with the seeding games, starting with a TNT doubleheader featuring Utah against New Orleans at 6:30 p.m. ET , followed by a battle between the Clippers and Lakers at 9 p.m. ET . Let\u2019s take a look back at six teams who were playing well before the season was suspended. * * * The Lakers were on a tear before the NBA put the 2019-20 season on hiatus on Mar. 11. Going back to February 10, the Lakers rolled to a 10-2 record over their last 12 outings before the league\u2019s hiatus. The Lakers will begin seeding games ranked in the top five in offensive rating (113.0) and defensive rating (105.6). Given all the postseason experience on the roster, you can expect Los Angeles to kick up its game a few notches. Over his career, Anthony Davis averages 24 points and 10.4 rebounds per game. But in 13 playoff outings, Davis averaged 30.5 ppg and 12.7 rpg. Veteran Rajon Rondo has averaged 10.2 ppg, 8.3 apg and 1.7 steals per game in his career, but those numbers go up to 10.3 rpg and 12.2 apg. A right thumb fracture will keep him out of the team\u2019s eight seeding games, but Lakers coach Frank Vogel expects the veteran to be back at some point during the playoffs. Rondo has averaged 10 assists or more in the postseason with three different teams (Boston, Chicago and New Orleans). And we haven\u2019t even discussed the potential impact of players such as Howard, Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma. Don\u2019t sleep on the defending champions. When the NBA suspended the season, Toronto was riding the league\u2019s longest winning streak (four games). Raptors coach Nick Nurse has said he\u2019s been surprised that his team operates as if it feels none of the pressure that he expected it to shoulder after winning a title last season. That means Toronto is focused. The No. 2 team in the East, Toronto lost two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard to the LA Clippers in free agency. But the Raptors didn\u2019t fall off defensively, and enter Orlando No. 2 in defensive rating (105.2). After losing Leonard\u2019s production on offense, Toronto stepped it up across the board. That charge has been led by Pascal Siakam, who increased his scoring and rebounding averages to 23.6 ppg and 7.5 rpg, respectively, after posting 16.9 ppg and 6.9 rpg in 2018-19. Kyle Lowry raised his scoring average to 19.7 ppg (from 14.2 ppg last season), while Fred VanVleet went from 11.0 ppg and 4.8 apg last season to 17.7 and 6.6 this season. Norman Powell and Serge Ibaka also lifted up their scoring averages. 3. LA Clippers  Fourteen postseason appearances, and no championships, the Clippers are hungry to stake a claim for supremacy in Los Angeles. The neutral environment the Orlando campus provides would wipe away any potential Lakers advantage in a head-to-head series. It\u2019s unlikely the Clippers were worried about that anyway. After dropping three in a row from Feb. 11-22, the Clippers rolled to victories in seven of their next eight before the season went on hiatus. Led by Leonard, who has already captured championships with two different teams, the Clippers come into Orlando ranked fourth in scoring (116.2), third in offensive rating (113.6) and fourth in defensive rating (107.2). Chemistry was once an issue, mostly because the entire team rarely practiced together due to injuries and load management, but every team could be dealing with that during the restart. Sitting back at fifth in the West, the eight seeding games provide a perfect opportunity for Oklahoma City to move up in the standings. The Thunder are a game behind the Utah Jazz for the No. 4 seed, and a 1 1\/2 games behind the Denver Nuggets for the third seed. Oklahoma City restarts the season with some momentum, too, having captured wins in eight of its last 10 games before the hiatus. The Thunder suffered back-to-back blowout losses to Milwaukee and the LA Clippers during that stretch, which is somewhat concerning. But the strong veteran leadership of point guard Chris Paul, combined with the youthful athleticism of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Kia Sixth Man of the Year candidate Dennis Schroder makes OKC dangerous. As NBA.com colleague John Schuhmann points out , only Milwaukee (38-9) and the Lakers (33-12) own better records than Oklahoma City since Thanksgiving. Paul leads the league in clutch scoring, and the Thunder have demonstrated a knack for coming out on top in close games , which could prove beneficial at a neutral site. Arguably the most surprising team of the Eastern Conference playoff field, Miami suffered a rough stretch over 21 days in February that made you wonder whether the Heat were the real deal. Miami dropped seven of nine games from Feb. 5-26, before bouncing back to win five of the next seven going into the hiatus. During that stretch, the Heat stunned a dominant Bucks squad at home, holding reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to just 13 points. Miami heads into the seeding games with an undefeated record (4-0) against Toronto and Milwaukee, the top two seeds in the East. However, the Heat are winless (0-2) against third-seeded Boston. The trade deadline brought in a strong veteran presence in Andre Iguodala to an already loaded roster featuring All-Star (and leader) Jimmy Butler, All-Star forward Bam Adebayo and fellow youngsters Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson. The Pacers won six of their last eight going into the hiatus, and along the way saw T.J. Warren and Domantas Sabonis put together breakout seasons. A first-time All-Star this season, Sabonis left the NBA campus to receive treatment for plantar fasciitis in his left foot, leaving uncertainty about his availability. Warren and Sabonis led the Pacers in scoring, and while Victor Oladipo has participated in Indiana\u2019s scrimmage games and workouts in Orlando, he hasn\u2019t yet decided whether he\u2019ll play once the seeding games commence. In his last outing before the hiatus, Oladipo poured in a season-high 27 points in a loss to Boston. So we definitely saw signs that Oladipo could be returning to the form that made him a two-time All-Star. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

For the last 15 seasons, first under coach Steve Fisher and then under his successor, longtime Fisher assistant Dutcher, the Aztecs have piled up victories (an average of 25.2 a year), dominated the Mountain West Conference, and have been frequent participants in the NCAA Tournament by adhering to certain core principles. Defense is a bedrock of the program, and when it comes to stocking it with players, the SDSU coaches look for a skill they consider to be just as important as any other in the game. Swagger. The theory behind that is simple. To win conference championships, a team has to win on the road. And to do that consistently, it helps to have a roster filled with players who have a proud or confident way of walking or behaving. That\u2019s why San Diego State and Malachi Flynn joined forces, and why Flynn is now preparing for a career in the NBA. Last season, Flynn, a 6-foot-1 point guard who transferred from Washington State, helped the Aztecs to accomplishments that stood out even compared to the program\u2019s high standards \u2014 30-2 record, a 26-game winning streak, 45 days as the No. 1 team in the NCAA\u2019s NET rankings, victories at BYU, by 31 over Creighton, by 10 over Iowa. The Aztecs clinched the Mountain West regular-season championship on Feb. 11 and ended up winning it by a league-record five games. They\u2019ve won 12 consecutive road games over a two-year period, and before a last-second loss in the MWC tournament, had won 16 consecutive games on the road or neutral sites. Flynn wasn\u2019t solely responsible for the Aztecs\u2019 success, but he led them in scoring, assists, field goals made and attempted, 3-point field goals made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, steals, assist-to-turnover ratio and minutes played. Heading into the NCAA Tournament that was never played because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Aztecs \u2014 despite that loss in their conference tournament title game \u2014 were confident they could make a deep run. The nation would have loved watching them play, especially their dynamic point guard. It wasn\u2019t to be, but Flynn, who since high school had been overlooked and underappreciated because of his lack of size, did what he was recruited to do, did what the San Diego State staff knew he could do since the Aztecs lost to Washington State in the 2017 Wooden Classic when Flynn scored 24 points with six 3-pointers and handed out six assists. That game was played in Cal State Fullerton\u2019s 4,000-seat gym before a crowd of about 1,700, which also allowed the Aztec coaches to hear Flynn verbally jousting with their fans. Swagger. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill,\u201d Dutcher says. \u201cConfidence is a skill. Some players blame the coaches for not letting them do this, or that. When you play here, I\u2019m gonna tell you that you can shoot as many 3s as you want. If you don\u2019t believe in it, don\u2019t put that on me. I\u2019m giving you the green light to do it. At the end of the day, smart players know what their weaknesses are. They know what they can and can\u2019t do. You don\u2019t have to overcoach them.\u201d By either the dictionary\u2019s definition or Dutcher\u2019s, Flynn embodies swagger. How else to explain the confidence he showed last April, when he decided to bypass his final season of college eligibility, sign with an agent and declare for the NBA Draft? Most analysts \u2014 perhaps using the measurables that have worked against Flynn his entire career \u2014 think he\u2019ll be chosen in the second round. But those who know him and have coached him believe he\u2019s a first-round talent. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that\u2019s going to separate him in the NBA, besides his competitiveness, is he\u2019s an elite, elite shooter,\u201d says San Diego State assistant coach David Velasquez. \u201cBut he\u2019s also in elite condition. When you put those together, in draft workouts \u2014 if there were draft workouts \u2014 he would have gone in there and just smashed shooting drills and competitions. \u201cI think the way he shoots the ball and how much he\u2019s obsessed with basketball, his NBA stock would have risen through the roof. He might be one of the last players I\u2019ll recruit that\u2019s never played [the online video game] Fortnite, as silly as that might sound. Because he\u2019s just a basketball guy. Basketball all the time.\u201d Flynn came by his competitive nature and work ethic by way of his large family. He was the youngest of seven siblings, and to hear him tell it, survival of the fittest was the rule of the household. \u201cI learned that nothing\u2019s going to be given to you, no matter what,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cEven in the house. If there\u2019s one last piece of food, I wasn\u2019t going to be able to go get it. I don\u2019t think I won a game of one-on-one growing up. [His older brothers] were not going to let that happen. Not in my family. Everything is earned.\u201d Clearly not many college programs delved into that aspect of Flynn\u2019s background when he played at Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma, Washington. As a senior, he averaged 29.7 points, six rebounds and four assists and was voted the state\u2019s player of the year. Still, his choices were limited \u2014 the University of San Diego, Pacific and Washington State. Flynn took the power conference offer. In two seasons at Washington State, Flynn averaged plenty of minutes (33.3 per game) and hoisted plenty of shots (655, including 378 from distance), but the Cougars were a combined 25-37. Flynn wanted to play for a winning program, and one that put the ball in guards\u2019 hands and let them make plays. When after the 2017-18 season Flynn announced on Twitter his intention to transfer, he quickly became a hot commodity. He trimmed an impressive list of schools down to two that fit his criteria \u2014 Creighton and San Diego State. The Aztec coaches left little to chance, reasoning that the key to recruiting Flynn was to recruit his family, too. \u201cWhen I\u2019d go up to Tacoma, I\u2019d have to go to the sister\u2019s house, the brother\u2019s house and the mom\u2019s house,\u201d Velasquez says. \u201cThen I\u2019d meet up with dad. Then I\u2019d get on a plane and fly to Pullman, Washington to see Malachi. And I just kept doing it, over and over.\u201d Dutcher and Velasquez didn\u2019t just tell Flynn what he wanted to hear. \u201cI brought all the ways he could get better and how he could get to the NBA, and why the NBA didn\u2019t think he was effective,\u201d Velasquez says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple guards get drafted, and Malachi really bought in to wanting to get better, wanting to get to the NBA, and wanted to hear what he was not so good at. I thought that was really powerful. Building a relationship, letting him know he was going to get coached.\u201d Flynn did his homework before he made his final decision. \u201cAfter having two years under my belt already, I felt like I knew what I wanted out of a school,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted the same opportunity I had at Washington State with the ball in my hands a lot, but at the same time, I wanted a place where the culture was established and that wins. And I knew from my research that [SDSU] had two senior guards graduating.\u201d The match of player and program turned out to be perfect. SDSU\u2019s sports information department says that in Flynn\u2019s lone season, he became the most decorated player in school history. He was one of only three Aztecs, along with Kawhi Leonard (2011) and Michael Cage (1984), to earn consensus All-America honors. He was also a finalist for the Bob Cousy Point Guard of the Year, the Naismith National Player of the Year and the Lute Olson National Player of the Year awards and was voted Mountain West Player of the Year, as well as first-team All-Mountain West in both the coaches\u2019 and media polls. The media voted him MWC Newcomer of the Year, and he was also chosen the league\u2019s defensive player of the year. Flynn led the MWC in assists, steals and assist-to-turnover ratio (2.9:1) and was third in scoring and free-throw percentage. He was fifth in field-goal percentage and 3-pointers made. Clearly Flynn knows how to stuff a stat sheet. That\u2019s the way he\u2019s always played. \u201cI played on a lot of good teams, in AAU and high school,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI remember on my AAU teams, my older brother would ask me if I\u2019m not scoring what was I doing. Why do coaches want to put me on the floor? At first, I didn\u2019t know. But then I learned I needed to bring other things to the game. To put people in the right positions. To handle pressure and be a leader.\u201d Dutcher thinks Flynn can take all that to the NBA. \u201cHis assist-to-turnover ratio is what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Dutcher says. \u201cIn the NBA, you\u2019ve got to play with others and know where the open man is. And Malachi knows where everybody is. He gets on the right team, and they\u2019re going to put him out there in space with other players. He\u2019s going to look good himself, but he\u2019s going to make other players look better. \u201cThe game at the NBA level is poetry \u2014 the way they share the ball and get you chasing around. Malachi knows how to make the game look like poetry. You\u2019re too slow chasing, he\u2019s going to knock the shot down. If you over run, he\u2019s gonna get the next pass to someone who\u2019s going to knock it down.\u201d Velasquez has an apt NBA comparison for Flynn \u2014 Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet. \u201cPeople ask if Malachi can defend at the next level,\u201d Velasquez says. \u201cIf you look at his body, his metrics, his weight, he\u2019s the same as Fred Van Vleet was coming out of college. Now VanVleet\u2019s known as a lockdown NBA defender. \u201cFred\u2019s worked out in our practice facility with Kawhi Leonard when he was with the Raptors. I\u2019ve seen him up close. He and Malachi aren\u2019t crazy blessed with length or athletically, but to succeed like VanVleet has you have to be intelligent and have an incredible basketball IQ. That\u2019s Malachi.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Bryn Forbes led the bench with 15 points, four rebounds and two assists. Drew Eubanks recorded a double-double off the bench, generating 12 points and 14 boards.  Caris LeVert led the Nets with 27 points, two rebounds, three assists and three steals. Jarrett Allen totaled 10 points, 11 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Rodions Kurucs led the bench with 17 points, four rebounds and two assists. Tyler Johnson also had 17 points off the bench.  On deck for Brooklyn is a matchup with the Utah Jazz on Monday. As for the Spurs, they\u2019re off until Tuesday when they face the Indiana Pacers.  By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire * * * The LA Clippers defeated the Washington Wizards, 105-100 , in an NBA scrimmage Friday in Orlando. The Clippers and the Wizards played a tighter contest than expected. Despite the fact the Clippers took control of the game quickly with a 30-24 first quarter, they couldn\u2019t hold on to that lead for an extended period. In fact, the Wizards came all the way to grab a three-point lead at the half following a 37-28 second quarter. Washington increased that lead by eight following the third, and it seemed as if they would\u2019ve been able to come away with the win. Such wasn\u2019t the case, though, and the Clippers completed a fourth-quarter comeback thanks to a 29-16 fourth quarter. Doc Rivers\u2019 group prevailed and secured a come-from-behind victory, as they continue to gear up for the league\u2019s restart next month. Seven Clippers scored in double digits in this game, but, perhaps surprisingly, the leading scorer was Patrick Patterson with 16 points off the bench, while Paul George finished with 11 points, and Kawhi Leonard registered a woeful 3-for-16 night from the field that resulted in just six points. As for the Wizards, both Isaac Bonga (15 points, 12 rebounds) and Rui Hachimura (15 points, 10 boards) posted double-doubles, while Thomas Bryant and Jerome Robinson each had 13 points. Both teams will resume play on Monday. The Clippers will face the Kings, while the Wizards will go up against the Lakers. By Juan Pablo Aravena, RotoWire * * * The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Denver Nuggets, 119-104 , on Saturday in an NBA Season Restart Scrimmage in Orlando. The Pelicans had no problem controlling the pace of the game as soon as things started, and they quickly jumped to a comfortable 33-20 lead following the first quarter. The Nuggets, who were extremely depleted once again, were no match for New Orleans. The Pelicans saw their lead reduce to a sizable 11-point edge by halftime. The Nuggets shortened the gap to 10 points by the time the third quarter ended, but the Pelicans got the job done in the final minutes. A 34-29 fourth-quarter score lifted New Orleans to a comfortable victory. Five Pelicans scored in double digits, and all of them were bench players. Nickeil Alexander-Walker led the way with 21 points, while Sindarius Thornwell notched 12 points, six assists and three rebounds. Frank Jackson had 16 points, and Jaxson Hayes delivered 13 points with six boards. As for the Nuggets, Nikola Jokic flirted with a triple-double (11 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists) as a point guard, while Mason Plumlee chipped in with 18 points and 13 boards. Bol Bol posted 15 points despite shooting just 6-for-19 from the field and 2-for-7 from 3-point range. Both teams will resume play on Monday. The Pelicans will face the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Nuggets will lock horns with the Orlando Magic.

The Knicks are finishing a deal to make Thibodeau their coach, a person with knowledge of the details said Saturday. No contract has been signed but a deal is expected to be announced next week, the person told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations were ongoing. ESPN first reported that the Knicks and Thibodeau were completing a five-year contract. When they do, the 2011 NBA Coach of the Year in Chicago will become the 13th different person to coach the Knicks since Jeff Van Gundy resigned early in the 2001-02 season. Orlando Magic coach Steve Clifford was told during his team\u2019s scrimmage at Walt Disney World against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday that Thibodeau, his longtime friend and confidant, was going to get the New York job. \u201cLook, he\u2019s one of my closest friends,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best coaches in the league and he understands New York. He was in New York for a long time. New York is a different animal. He understands the fan base. He understands the New York media and he\u2019s a great, great coach. So, he\u2019ll do great there and it\u2019s a great hire on their part.\u201d Thibodeau was an assistant under Van Gundy, who led the Knicks to the 1999 NBA Finals and into the postseason in every season he was there. New York has reached the playoffs just three times since Van Gundy\u2019s departure. The Knicks went 21-45 this season, missing the playoffs for a seventh straight year. Mike Miller finished the season as interim coach after David Fizdale was fired 22 games into the season. New Knicks President Leon Rose then interviewed a number of candidates before choosing Thibodeau from a field that included Jason Kidd, former Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson and Miller, who impressed Rose while going 17-27 before the season was suspended in March. San Antonio assistants Will Hardy and Ime Udoka were also candidates. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said both will get their opportunities but praised the choice of Thibodeau. \u201cTommy\u2019s a seasoned veteran who it goes without saying understands what wins and what loses. He knows how to put a program together, create a culture and be demanding \u2014 and at the same time, make people accountable,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to demand things, but to make people accountable and want to play the right way is not something that\u2019s easy for everybody to do. But Tom knows it inside and out and he\u2019ll be a great choice to organize the situation there, develop a plan, start the culture, stick to it, be persistent and get after it. So it\u2019s a great choice.\u201d Thibodeau is regarded as a demanding coach who is one of the top defensive minds in the game. He devised the defense that carried the Boston Celtics to the 2008 NBA championship as an assistant before becoming Chicago\u2019s coach in 2010. He guided the Bulls to a 62-20 record as a rookie coach, the first of five straight postseason berths even as the team battled constant injuries to star guard Derrick Rose and others. Overall, he is 352-246 as a head coach. He led the Minnesota Timberwolves to the postseason in 2018 but was fired the next year during a rocky season that began with star Jimmy Butler asking to be traded. Players around the league took notice of the pending move as well. Heat forward Jae Crowder retweeted a clip from a 2018 game Saturday, one where he was playing for Utah and Thibodeau was coaching the Timberwolves. Crowder and Thibodeau got involved in a very heated war of words during the game that night, earning them both technical fouls. \u201cCONGRATS TIBS ON THE NEW COACHING JOB. CANT WAIT TO HAVE THESE BATTLES WITH YOU AGAIN.!,\u201d Crowder tweeted Saturday."},{"id":26841,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-lawyers-asks-judge-disregard-affidavit","date":"2020-07-25","title":"Zion Williamson's lawyers ask judge to disregard affidavit","content":" Lawyers for New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson asked a federal judge in North Carolina on Friday to disregard an affidavit alleging a $400,000 payment was made to Williamson\u2019s family before the former Duke star began his lone college season. The new filing by attorney Jeffrey Klein reiterates his earlier public assertion that the claims made in the sworn affidavit were false and that evidence meant to support those claims, such as a purported Williamson driver\u2019s license, were fraudulent. The affidavit was provided to the court in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, by lawyers for ex-Williamson marketing agent Gina Ford, who is seeking $100 million in damages from the basketball star for breach of contract. Klein said Ford\u2019s lawyers have sought to file an \u201cimproper, legally irrelevant, and patently false set of papers \u2026 aimed at sullying the character of Mr. Williamson.\u201d Ford, the president of Prime Sports Marketing, filed a lawsuit last summer in a Florida state court accusing Williamson and the agency now representing him of breach of contract. That came a week after Williamson filed his own lawsuit in a North Carolina federal court to terminate a five-year contract with Prime Sports after moving to Creative Artists Agency LLC. Earlier this month, Ford\u2019s attorneys included a sworn affidavit from Donald Kreiss, a self-described entrepreneur from California, who said the head of a Canadian-based firm called Maximum Management Group (MMG) told him he paid Williamson\u2019s family for his commitment to sign with MMG once he left Duke for the NBA. The documents include a signed marketing agreement between Williamson and MMG from May 2019; a December 2019 \u201cletter of declaration\u201d supposedly signed by Williamson and his stepfather agreeing to pay $500,000 to MMG president Slavko Duric for \u201crepayment of a loan\u201d from October 2018; and a copy of Williamson\u2019s South Carolina driver\u2019s license \u2014 which listed Williamson\u2019s height as \u201c284\u201d and his weight as \u201c6\u203206.\u201d Klein noted that the Williamson signature on the MMG agreement differs from the signature Williamson provided to Ford when he initially signed with her. Klein asserted that Ford\u2019s attorneys \u201cpossessed information sufficient to confirm that the documents attached to the Kreiss affidavit were fraudulent. A cursory comparison of that information readily evidences that the documents are forgeries.\u201d Kreiss has since told Sports Illustrated he\u2019d been defrauded and never had contact with Williamson or his family. Ford\u2019s attorneys have focused their case on a contention that Williamson had violated his college eligibility, and by extension, relinquished his amateur states, before he signed his initial marketing agreement with Ford. Williamson\u2019s lawsuit to terminate his agreement with Ford stated that Prime Sports violated North Carolina\u2019s sports agent law, both by failing to include disclaimers about the loss of eligibility when signing the contract and the fact neither Prime Sports nor Ford were registered with the state. Ford\u2019s attorneys have argued the Uniform Athlete Agents Act wouldn\u2019t apply if Williamson was ineligible to play college basketball from the start. To bolster that argument, Ford\u2019s attorneys also have sought to have last summer\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick answer questions in Florida state court about whether he received improper benefits before playing for the Blue Devils. They had also raised questions about housing for Williamson\u2019s family during his Duke career in a separate filing in North Carolina. A Florida appeals court last month granted a stay to pause the proceedings there, shifting the focus to the North Carolina case. Duke has repeatedly declined to comment on the case because it isn\u2019t involved in the litigation, but issued a statement in January that school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns."},{"id":26811,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/3-missouri-players-withdraw-nba-draft","date":"2020-07-25","title":"3 Missouri players withdraw from NBA Draft","content":" COLUMBIA, Mo.

(AP) \u2014 Zion Williamson will be out of quarantine by the time New Orleans plays in the first official game of the NBA restart at Walt Disney World. Whether the Pelicans will play him that night or not remains anyone\u2019s guess. The NBA said Saturday that Williamson will have to serve a four-day quarantine for leaving the league\u2019s Disney bubble on July 16 to tend to an urgent family matter. He returned to Disney on Friday night and immediately went into quarantine. That means he will likely be released from quarantine sometime Tuesday, two days before the Pelicans play the first \u201cseeding game\u201d against the Utah Jazz. A person familiar with the situation said that if all goes well with Williamson\u2019s quarantine, he can return to team activities during a practice scheduled for Tuesday night. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because such plans have not been completed and cannot be until Williamson passes more tests now that he has returned to Disney. \u201cThe most important thing is we hope everything\u2019s OK with him,\u201d Pelicans forward Derrick Favors said Saturday, shortly after the NBA revealed the four-day quarantine determination. \u201cHe went away for personal reasons. So, it\u2019s good to see. Whatever it was, hope everything went fine and OK and he\u2019s back with us. And I know everybody\u2019s excited to have him back. I know he\u2019s excited to be back.\u201d Williamson was tested daily during his absence and continually came back negative for COVID-19, which helped his hopes for a shorter quarantine upon his return to Disney. The league has said quarantine for those who leave the bubble can last as much as 10 days or more if those individuals are not tested daily while they are away. The No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s NBA draft is averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds in 19 games this season for the Pelicans, who are one of six teams in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference."},{"id":26852,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/scrimmage-roundup-july-24","date":"2020-07-24","title":"NBA Scrimmages Roundup: Day 3 from Orlando","content":"All 22 teams participating in the NBA Restart will play three scrimmages before game action officially tips off on July 30.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because the deal was still in the process of being submitted. The group will consist of two to five individuals with a net worth of more than $10 billion. According to the people, Afflalo\u2019s group will submit the bid no later than this weekend. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, who bought the club in 1994 to keep it from moving to New Orleans, has put the franchise up for sale on the condition it remain in Minnesota. Taylor has hired a merchant bank, The Raine Group, to broker talks. There are multiple groups interested, the 79-year-old Taylor said earlier this week. He also owns the WNBA\u2019s Minnesota Lynx. The Timberwolves have a lease at the city-owned Target Center that lasts through 2035. A $140 million renovation project on the arena was finished in 2017. In the latest sports franchise valuations from Forbes business magazine, the Timberwolves ranked 28th out of the 30 NBA teams, but still at $1.375 billion, albeit before the pandemic began. Basketball Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett announced he\u2019s part of one group trying to buy the team he starred for from 1995-2007. Garnett and Taylor had a falling out after his return to the Timberwolves in 2015. Garnett told The Athletic in an interview earlier this year that he doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with snakes,\u201d but on Twitter this week Garnett said he looks forward to trying to work with Taylor to \u201cachieve my dream\u201d of NBA ownership. Minnesota Vikings owners Zygi Wilf and Mark Wilf were recently contacted about their interest in buying the franchise. According to a person with knowledge of that situation, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the negotiations, the Wilfs had back-and-forth conversations about a potential acquisition, but those talks are not active. The people familiar with Afflalo\u2019s group said the team won\u2019t be relocated. The 34-year-old Afflalo would be the face of the group, with venture capitalist Brock Berglund spearheading the financing. The only Black primary owner in the NBA now is Michael Jordan in Charlotte. It\u2019s a diverse group seeking to place minorities in positions of power and uplift the community in the wake of the death of George Floyd, the handcuffed Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly 8 minutes. Known for his defensive tenacity, Afflalo played in 762 games over a dozen years for Detroit, Orlando, Denver, New York, Sacramento and Portland. His career earnings from NBA salaries topped $58 million, according to Basketball Reference. Afflalo was drafted 27th overall in 2007 by the Pistons, where his first coach was the late Flip Saunders and who started Afflalo in the first game of his rookie season. Saunders\u2019 son, Ryan, is the current coach of the Timberwolves. A native of California, Afflalo helped UCLA advance to the national title game during the 2006 NCAA Tournament before falling to Florida. One of the iconic images of the tournament was when Afflao stopped his celebration after his team beat Gonzaga to console Adam Morrison, who was lying on the floor in tears. The gesture was hailed as a picture of sportsmanship. Afflalo was also featured in a song by Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar. In the song \u201cBlack Boy Fly,\u201d Lamar wrote: \u201cI used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo. He was the one to follow. He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows.\u201d Lamar and Afflalo went to the same high school in Compton, California."},{"id":26837,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-day-12","date":"2020-07-24","title":"Disney World Diary: After two weeks, COVID-19 testing just part of the daily routine","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Test, test, one-two. Three-four. Five-six. Seven-eight. Heck, why stop there? Saturday will mark my 14th test for COVID-19 and that\u2019s over 14 days. You might sense a pattern. For as long and I\u2019m on this planet \u2014 meaning, this self-contained safe globe constructed by the NBA \u2014 I will get the swab up the nose and down the throat every \u2026 single \u2026 day. There are 137 steps between the front door of my room at the Coronado Springs Resort to the testing room. Each morning, my alarm rings at 9, I check to see if I have my mask over my face and MagicBand on my wrist, then take the long walk to learn my fate. The suspense really isn\u2019t as thick as the humidity. Because of all the safety protocols in place, I\u2019d be shocked if I register a positive test. Besides, I\u2019m extra careful, although there have been some close calls. Bogdan Bogdanovic, the extremely sociable guard for the Kings, tried to greet me with a handshake Friday. I glanced over at the Kings\u2019 PR guy, Alex Segua, and he damn near fainted. By instinct, I extended my hand about four inches before stopping. Bogie recognized his mistake and offered a fist-pound instead, and even that is highly discouraged around here. I think I need some smelling salts to revive poor Alex. Anyway: The testing is done in two adjoining rooms. The front door is kept closed. When you knock, you\u2019re invited in to take a seat. The testers are insulated in protection from head to toe. They seem nice but aren\u2019t big on casual conversation; this is serious business. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name and date of birth?\u201d \u201cCheck this form and make sure it\u2019s correct and sign it.\u201d \u201cThank you. Please take this form over there and have a seat.\u201d That\u2019s how our chats go. And then, another tester sticks a Q-tip in places where dentists don\u2019t venture. When that throat swab is done, another is stuck up each nostril until it hits something back there; I\u2019m not sure what exactly, since in all my years I\u2019ve never looked or searched that deep. Each swab is placed in a tube, which is then sealed and you\u2019re free to go. Oh: \u201cHave a nice day\u201d they always say, and I imagine it\u2019s done with a smile but their mask makes that hard to tell. The entire process lasts three minutes and is rather innocent, although I did joke with the testers once how there was blood spilled the last time they tested me and I did get laughter, so there\u2019s that. Underneath their long white coats and behind those masks are people with a sense of humor, after all. By the time I leave Disney, I will have received over 60 tests. Before I arrived, I had zero. I realize how weird it is to live temporarily inside this safety-sealed spot, while those on the outside must deal with risks and possible exposure to the virus whenever the shop for food or gas their cars. Clippers coach Doc Rivers was serious when he said the NBA should send this idea to the White House. Obviously, there aren\u2019t enough hotel rooms at Disney for 375 million people; that said, any parent who ever stood in line for hours at Space Mountain might disagree. I wonder how I\u2019ll ever know if I test positive? A knock on the door by security? Maybe my wristband won\u2019t work at the arena? Or perhaps I\u2019ll return to my hotel room to discover someone packed my bags and placed them by the door, as a hint? My hunch: I\u2019ll never reach that point. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

In collaboration with broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports, more than 30 cameras, including many in robotic form, will be repositioned closer to the court and showcase never-before-seen camera angles in places that are otherwise not accessible with fans in the arena. Microphones around the court will capture enhanced sounds from the floor, including sneaker squeaks and ball bounces. DJs and announcers will be in-venue to help replicate the sounds and experiences teams are accustomed to in-arena.  Additionally, all viewers will have the ability to impact visual effects in the venue through a virtual cheering experience. Fans can digitally cheer for their team through the NBA App and NBA.com and on Twitter using team hashtags throughout the game. Virtual cheering will be reflected on the video boards in-venue with graphics and animations that capture the level of fan engagement around the world.

That\u2019s what had to be done with the Kia MVP Ladder the moment NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the suspension of the season on March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was that night when we learned that Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for Covid-19 . Others followed , including his All-Star teammate Donovan Mitchell . Last week, voters for the NBA\u2019s end-of-season awards \u2014 which include the Kia MVP \u2014 were informed that games after March 11 would not be used in evaluating players for awards purposes. (Ballots are due July 28, two days before the season restarts, negating any chance of it happening anyway.) That brings us back to the nearly five months between actual games this season \u2014 an eternity that gave plenty of time to deliberate about the merits of each candidate for the league\u2019s most prestigious individual (regular-season) award. What was a five-or six-man race early on \u2014 consisting of reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, four-time MVP LeBron James, his teammate Anthony Davis, two-time and reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, reigning Kia Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic and former MVP James Harden \u2014 had narrowed to a two-man sprint between Antetokounmpo and James. (Quick refresher: in the last weekend before the season hiatus, three of the top five candidates engaged in head-to-head action. James\u2019 crew beat Antetokounmpo\u2019s Bucks on a Friday night and Leonard\u2019s Clippers on a Sunday afternoon.) Some were arguing that James had for the moment passed Antetokounmpo, setting up a roller coaster ride to the scheduled finish of the 2019-20 season. Lakers coach Frank Vogel, far from an unbiased observer, didn\u2019t need that weekend or the months that have passed since then to make up his mind. He was ready to cast a vote for James during training camp, long before he went on to lead the league in assists in his 17th season. \u201cNobody impacts winning more than LeBron James, I do believe that he should be the MVP this year,\u201d Vogel said earlier this week on a Zoom call with reporters. \u201cI believe he should be the MVP and I believe Anthony Davis should be the Defensive Player of the Year. I hope those awards go to our two players. That\u2019s not to take anything away from some of the other candidates. But what LeBron means to our team, even before the season begins when the roster is being put together, with the number of guys that are on the Lakers because LeBron James is here and want to play with him. I think it starts there. \u201cAnd then obviously what he\u2019s able to do on the basketball court, orchestrating the offense, leading the league in assists and really setting the tone on the defensive end. We\u2019re the third best defense in the NBA, best in the West and a lot of that comes from his commitment this season, which has been greater than the last few years from what I\u2019m told, has really set us apart in terms of being the best record currently in the Western Conference.\u201d Vogel\u2019s loyalty is as admirable as his comments were predictable. (And what else would you expect him to say about his guy?) But it takes more than endorsements and even the memory of one spectacular weekend for a reshuffling of the order as significant as that, especially with the season Antetokounmpo put together after his first MVP season. He didn\u2019t play like a man satisfied with himself after falling short of his main goal of winning Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. He improved himself in every facet of the game, once again guiding the Bucks to the NBA\u2019s top overall record. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer provided a glowing endorsement of his own for his star, too. \u201cGiannis, in our minds, has done more than enough to deserve a back-to-back MVP,\u201d Budenholzer told reporters on July 17. \u201cWhat he does for us on both ends of the court, what he does every night, the way he sets the bar for us, culture-wise, work ethic-wise, just as a teammate. He\u2019s an incredible teammate, plays unselfishly, does everything. And I think that\u2019s kind of what the MVP is, so we certainly feel like he\u2019s very deserving, and we\u2019ll be excited to support him.\u201d LeBron\u2019s contextual and narrative brilliance \u2014 could he really be this good, this dominant and this impactful in the mighty Western Conference 17 years in? \u2014 would provide a decided edge in this race in a normal setting. But the raw, fearless and kinetic brilliance Giannis brought every night is hard to top. As spectacular as LeBron\u2019s season was, Giannis was even more impressive; he could join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon on the short list of players to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season. \u201cI want to be one of the best players to ever play the game,\u201d Antetokounmpo told reporters during a media availability session earlier this month. \u201cI did the best job I could do trying to stay ready and trying to have my team ready for this journey that we\u2019re about to go on to leave and play games. But as I said, whoever wants it more, whoever is mentally prepared for all this, what\u2019s going on in Orlando, that\u2019s the team that\u2019s gonna come out on top.\u201d Antetokounmpo had one request after winning his first MVP: he didn\u2019t want to hear anything about it as he readied for an encore. \u201cAfter this day \u2014 July 14 \u2014 please, please do me this favor so I can be a better player and I can lead this team to a championship, please don\u2019t call me MVP,\u201d he told an adoring crowd of Bucks fans at a downtown rally last summer . \u201cPlease after this day don\u2019t call me MVP, until I win it again next year.\u201d As you wish, Mr. MVP. * * * The Top 5 in the final Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of 2019-20:  * * * Season stats:  29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.0 blocks  That collective groan you heard Tuesday was front office personnel and coaches from the other playoff teams on the NBA campus in Orlando watching clips of Antetokounmpo\u2019s improved shooting stroke from 3-point range. It\u2019s the final part of his game that needs polishing so he can become the rest of the league\u2019s biggest nightmare. The Bucks\u2019 hopes for a championship run this season rest squarely on the broad shoulders of \u201cThe Greek Freak,\u201d whose relentless work ethic has fueled his rise to the top of this list for a second straight season. A virtually unstoppable two-way force with a still-evolving offensive arsenal, he improved his 3-point shooting (30.6%) to become just enough of a threat from deep to force teams to pick their poison in guarding him. His rapid rise from a relatively obscure Greek pro league to NBA MVP status is one of the great stories in sports history. Best of all, he\u2019s only a few chapters in at this stage of his career. Season stats:  25.7 points, 7.9 rebounds, 10.6 assists, 1.2 steals  LeBron wins this season\u2019s narrative award. Seventeen seasons into his NBA Mount Rushmore career, James led the league in assists and remains (in the eyes of many) the NBA\u2019s most dominant force. He\u2019s returned a proud Lakers franchise to contender status in a rich comeback story not even Hollywood could have penned. LeBron has been refining his game longer than some of his MVP competitors have been playing competitively \u2026 and in some cases (Luka Doncic), nearly as long as they\u2019ve been dribbling a ball. The Lakers have the look of a true contender with LeBron and All-Star big man Anthony Davis joining forces to become the league\u2019s most dynamic duo. The Lakers\u2019 struggles without LeBron this season might be the best exhibit of his MVP talents. Any doubts about him being able to perform at an elite level at his advanced NBA age have been silenced. Season stats:  28.7 points, 9.3 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.1 steals  Doncic went from dazzling as a rookie to downright dominant in his sophomore season, from runaway Kia Rookie of the Year to All-Star starter . The best part in Dallas is that he\u2019s taken the Mavericks along for the ride, returning them to the Western Conference playoff mix for the foreseeable future. It took Jason Kidd 500 career games to set the franchise triple-double mark. Doncic needed just 119 games to catch and pass him, with 21 before his 21st birthday . And who says lightning can\u2019t strike the same place twice? Doncic is owner Mark Cuban\u2019s dream replacement for franchise icon Dirk Nowitzki and Doncic is a hybrid built perfectly for this era. He has LeBron James-like playmaking skills with James Harden\u2019s scoring instincts. His sidekick, Kristaps Porzingis, played like an All-Star during the second half of his first season back from knee surgery. They are the clearest danger to the Lakers\u2019 pair as the league\u2019s most dynamic jumbo-sized duo. Season stats:  34.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.7 steals  Harden and Rockets GM Daryl Morey are convinced that the NBA\u2019s best player has worn a Rockets uniform for years now. But it\u2019s only been reflected once in the Kia MVP balloting. Given how Russell Westbrook has performed in his first season in Houston, there\u2019s a strong argument that Harden hasn\u2019t even been the best player on his own team since mid-January. Undoubtedly, Harden is one of the greatest NBA scorers ever and has shown himself to be an extraordinary playmaker. The only real knock on Harden, aside from his situational indifference on defense, is that he\u2019s struggled to carry his regular-season brilliance into the playoffs. Fair or not, that reputation seems to consistently poke holes in the MVP narrative the Rockets coordinate for him every season. In an era filled some of the greatest scorers and two-way stars, a one-dimensional superstar like Harden keeps coming up a bit short of the biggest prize. Season stats: 26.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.8 steals  There is still no evidence that Leonard even cares about regular season MVP awards. The two-time Finals MVP had the table set to chase the Kia MVP this season, but his injury-management protocol poked holes in his candidacy. Even with his unavailability being an issue, he proved time and again to be the league\u2019s most complete superstar in high-pressure situations. No player in the league can score at every level as he can (46.9% shooting, 36.6% on 3-pointers) while also being the best lockdown defender against other elite players. The Clippers\u2019 depth kept his absences from being felt the way they might have been had he played elsewhere. This season has been similar to 2018-19 in Toronto, where his supporting cast proved to be far better than given credit for. But much like he did for the Raptors last season, Kawhi serves as the ultimate closer for any contender. * * * 6. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers 7. Pascal Siakam, Toronto Raptors 8. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics 9. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  10. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat And five more:  Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder; Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets * * * A look at some additional Kia MVP storylines from 2019-20 that garner mentioning: 1. Close but not quite: James Harden\u2019s MVP consistency over the past five seasons is as impressive as any player in the league. He has three runner-up finishes (2015, \u201917 and \u201919) and won award in 2017-18. In 2014-15, 262 points separated Harden from Stephen Curry, 135 points separated he and Westbrook in 2016-17 and Antetokounmpo edged him out by 165 points in 2019-20. In his Kia MVP season, Harden finished 227 points ahead of James. Once again, he could end up in the top three of the 2019-20 voting. When these eight seeding games end, Harden will become the first player since Michael Jordan to average 30 ppg or more in three straight seasons. 2. A new L.A. story: Nothing impacts a player\u2019s MVP fortunes like opportunity. Last season, Paul George finished third in the voting while playing alongside a former MVP in Westbrook in Oklahoma City. Fast-forward to this season and George probably won\u2019t be anywhere in the mix after injuries and joining forces with Leonard altered the MVP perception about him. Leonard, who was ninth in last season\u2019s voting, is likely to finish in the top five this time around. He could finish as high as third, which would be his best finish since 2015-16, when he was on the San Antonio Spurs. 3. The rise of Luka-mania: After his wicked Rookie of the Year campaign, we knew Doncic was destined for NBA stardom. But an All-Star starter and potentially a top-three MVP finish in his second season is a bit more than even the most optimistic of Luka lovers could have predicted. Doncic\u2019s triple-double barrage and mastery of coach Rick Carlisle\u2019s system has vaulted him to superstar status and the Mavs back into the playoff mix for seasons to come. The search for the next torch-bearer of the game after (and perhaps alongside) Antetokounmpo has already revealed himself. The pairing of Doncic and Porzingis should be is enough to inspire championship ambitions sooner rather than later in Dallas. 4. Don\u2019t forget about us: In addition to Leonard\u2019s return to the MVP mix this season, new venues did likewise for Davis (Lakers), Jimmy Butler (Miami) and Chris Paul (Oklahoma City). These three veteran stars showed why they belong in the mix. No one was sure Paul would even suit up for the Thunder after last summer\u2019s trade that swapped he and Westbrook. Paul didn\u2019t miss a beat with the Thunder, though. Serving as the ideal mentor for young(er) point guards Dennis Schroder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, he lead a surprising playoff push in OKC. Few suspected this Thunder team would be playoff-bound, let alone entering the season restart at 40-24 \u2014 the same record as the Rockets. 5. Rising the MVP ranks: Get used to seeing budding stars like Nikola Jokic, Pascal Siakam and Jayson Tatum on MVP lists for the foreseeable future. They\u2019re all franchise players for teams that will be contenders in the coming seasons. Jokic already has a first-team All-NBA nod on his resume was curiously omitted from MVP conversations last year. Both Siakam and Tatum stepped into the MVP mix for the first time this season and both could earn All-NBA honors for their work. This trio represents a wave of 25-and-under superstars who aren\u2019t about to wait for their elders to step aside so they can shine. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Way too early, in fact. But since Kia MVP watching has become a year-round affair, it makes sense to mention five players, absent from the list this season, who will play their way into the conversation next season: * * * 1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets: Just two years ago, on the heels of back-to-back Finals MVP performances, we were debating whether or not Durant had overtaken LeBron as the best player in the NBA. Now would be the time to put some respect on his name as he returns from sitting out an entire season recovering from Achilles surgery. He will be on a vengeance tour with teammate Kyrie Irving as the both lead a dangerous Nets crew. 2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors: Another seemingly forgotten member of the MVP club, a broken hand and the Warriors\u2019 abrupt fall from their dynasty days back to the lottery will no doubt fuel the fire of the two-time MVP. Having fellow All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green fully healthy for 2020-21 will only help Curry\u2019s cause, too. 3. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers: He was supposed to be a legitimate challenger to Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s hold on the top spot this season. But this was yet another tumultuous season for the most talented big man in the game. We\u2019re still trusting in \u201cThe Process\u201d \u2026 for now. 4. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks: The All-Star guard finished his second season ranked in the top five in points and assists . Somehow, he\u2019s still scrapping for respect when it come to the MVP discussion. That will end next season, if and when the Hawks turn the corner and compete for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 5. Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards: His first season as the clear-cut face of the franchise in Washington was just more evidence to what we already knew: he\u2019s one of the NBA\u2019s most unstoppable scorers and underrated two-way players. If the rumblings about John Wall being back healthy and ready to go this fall are true, the Wizards could also be one of the wild card items in the Eastern Conference next season. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Dario Saric had 12 points and six rebounds, while Devin Booker notched 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting. Deandre Ayton chipped in 13 points of his own to go with eight rebounds and two assists. Ayton even drilled a late-shot-clock three-pointer in the second half. As for the Jazz, Donovan Mitchell had 17 points and four assists while making five of his eight field-goal attempts. Mike Conley notched 12 points, and Jordan Clarkson scored 14 points in 21 minutes coming off the bench. Rudy Gobert was mostly quiet in 21 minutes, finishing with five points, six rebounds and two steals. The Jazz will play their next scrimmage on Saturday against the Miami Heat. Meanwhile, the Suns will face the Boston Celtics on Sunday.

That was his world, his \u2018hood, the sights and sounds that shaped his view although, as is typical with kids, he didn\u2019t know anything different. This was a Southern California town called Paramount, a bedroom community that only the naive would define as suburban Los Angeles. Paramount neighbors Compton to the west and Bellflower to the east, sandwiched between two slices of toughness. Forty years ago, just before he was born into it, Paramount was listed in 1981 as one of the most dangerous towns in America with 40,000 or less citizens. Yes, the place truly fit the definition of its name, meaning it was paramount that Paramount feel the urgency to reform. Anyway, the boy and his family moved when he reached sixth grade \u2026 to Iowa, of all places, and not just any Iowa, but a speck called Pella, and you can just imagine cultural seismic shock to his little system. The heavy snow, which he\u2019d never really seen before, was white. The clouds, now that the sky was free of smog, were white. And here\u2019s where the white of all whiteness really registered and jarred him: The people. Just about every \u2026 single \u2026 person. And that, more than anything else, made him feel sorrowful and lonely. He was out of place, out of his element, with no black or brown friends, his comfort zone suddenly and frightfully squeezed. \u201cHe really struggled with that,\u201d said his father. Now, this might seem strange to anyone who looks at Kyle Korver, a white NBA player. But here in America\u2019s summer of 2020, where the racial divide and climate is under siege, there is perhaps no more important human laboratory rat for the struggle than the 39-year-old shooting guard for the Milwaukee Bucks. If you wanted to create an NBA logo to symbolize the league\u2019s mandate to promote racial progress and unity, there are strong options. You can choose the silhouette of LeBron James because of his massive social media platform; or Sterling Brown of the Bucks, who was once strong-armed by police on a Milwaukee street; or Jaylen Brown, the studious young forward for the Celtics whose grasp of history and politics seems well beyond his years. But somewhere on that front line there must be a seat for Korver, someone who has spent his entire adult life and pro career toggling between Paramounts and Pellas, black folks and white folks, and therefore has something to say and a message to spread. \u201cI guess I have an interesting story,\u201d he said, \u201cthat has given me a unique perspective.\u201d Korver is a basketball long-shot in multiple ways. He was the 51st selection in the 2003 draft and those types usually don\u2019t survive, but he\u2019s now in his 17th and perhaps final season. He wasn\u2019t projected as an All-Star, yet he checked that box in 2015. And obviously the long shot has literally served him well; Korver owns the record for highest 3-point percentage (53.6%) in one season, should finish top-10 percentage all-time and is fourth all-time in 3-pointers made . He\u2019s with his sixth team, each one gifted by his shooting in a game that drastically developed a greater taste for shooters and the space on the floor they create. But Korver also benefitted at each stop with a gift that would expand his view of humanity and race. As a white man in a black man\u2019s game and locker room, he received a level of education and awareness and sensitivity that escapes many who look like him. \u201cWhen I went to Philadelphia I was the only white guy on the team my rookie year,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a couple years I get traded to Salt Lake City, which is as white as it gets in the NBA. Went from there to Chicago and Atlanta. Then I went to Cleveland, then back to Utah. And now I\u2019m in Milwaukee, a place some say is the most segregated city in America. It seems whenever I go, I move from one side to the other.\u201d Lots of suitcases and real estate agents. But with all the mileage comes wisdom, which he\u2019s anxious to share. \u201cMy hope is that I can gain information from my black friends and teammates and then take those messages to people on the other side who maybe don\u2019t get the chance to hear them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky space for me, to be in the middle, but at the same time it\u2019s important work for me.\u201d Korver\u2019s father, Kevin Korver, was a pastor in Paramount and rooted the family in that community instead of living a few towns away. The Korvers and their church were recruited to improve the neighborhood and did yeoman volunteer work, clearing enough trash and planting enough trees and painting enough homes to earn a Point Of Light Award from President George H.W. Bush. \u201cKyle was with me as we served our community,\u201d said Kevin Korver. \u201cIt was really fun because while the white folks were in the minority, we were invited in by the community and together we helped bring change.\u201d Kevin Korver spent $2,000 to build a basketball court, for Korver and his brothers and also the community kids, as a safe spot. Therefore, the Education Of Kyle Korver simply moved between the baskets, where the ball was shared by black and brown players \u2026 and the Korver boys. \u201cThat typified the experience we had with our children in Los Angeles,\u201d said Kevin Korver. \u201cMost of Kyle\u2019s friends were non-white. Then we got a calling to come to an all-white town in Iowa. In California , everyone was of color. In Iowa, there were 10,000 white people and this was tough on him because he gravitated to children who weren \u2019 t white.\u201d Kevin Korver is still in Pella as the senior pastor of the Third Church . In a town where he estimates less than 100 people are non-white, the challenge to understand the plight of people of color can be daunting for Flyover Country. \u201cWe live in all-white Iowa where sitcoms and what\u2019s on TV and on social media can shape our perceptions and where we get our information from,\u201d Kevin Korver said. \u201cHow do you get properly exposed by living in an all white town?\u201d Kyle Korver isn\u2019t so restricted. His world-view and understanding of a different culture \u2014 all helped by his California roots and a collegiate stop at Creighton \u2014 launched him well for the NBA. Allen Iverson vouches for him. So does LeBron James, who once said when it comes to race, Korver \u201cgets it\u201d and regularly engaged Korver while they were teammates in Cleveland. Because Korver is into a second decade in the NBA, the nationwide racial flash points along the way only managed to expand those conversations . \u201cYou\u2019re always learning,\u201d Kyle Korver said. \u201cI want to be educated. I can\u2019t teach my kids things I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re 7, 5 and 3. We\u2019re starting now while they\u2019re young. We went on several marches together as a family. They got to see people who were very hurt and lots of emotions. On the drive home we talked about it, asked questions. Me and my wife are very aware of how we\u2019re going to raise our children, making sure there\u2019s voices instructing them that aren\u2019t just white.\u201d He laughed and added: \u201cKids start learning about race early. My daughter keeps saying she has peach skin. She\u2019s just seven! These are things kids learn. Loving your neighbor was a theme I had growing up. See the humanity in everyone. That\u2019s what we\u2019re teaching them.\u201d Kyle Korver doesn\u2019t personally witness many examples of racial injustice. His friends outside basketball live in a more centralized society and have stories, or at least heard them. Same for his father. \u201cWhat I find strange,\u201d said Kevin Korver, \u201cis that in sports, you can have white fans who root and cheer for their favorite African American players, and then those same fans will turn around and go into a bar after the game and mistreat a waiter who happens to be black. How in the world does that happen? There\u2019s such a disconnect. \u201cThe best thing for Kyle is he\u2019s this white man in a world dominated by people of color who are all very accomplished. His perspective is being shaped by his reality. He \u2019 s got a group of black friends he listens to a lot. They \u2019 ve said to him, \u2018You got to speak to the white folks because there \u2019 s so few white voices speaking.\u2019 That \u2019 s a great challenge. He \u2019 s trying to listen and learn.\u201d Kyle Korver will never know the angst of a race or understand the feeling of systemic racism; he wasn\u2019t born into that segment of society. Yet he does the next best thing by tapping into that group, and into his own past, to shape his beliefs and those of his children and neighbors. \u201cTo watch LeBron use his platform to make a difference was important for me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see him leverage that platform and step into spaces that are confrontational, I haven\u2019t done that in the past. Look, everybody loves to do their part to help out the kids, food banks, hospitals, there\u2019s a lot of ways to give back to communities, but this is a deeper and harder space to step into. My way is going to be different than LeBron\u2019s way, right? \u201cBut just watching him try was really helpful for me. And so I think I can do more.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

Longtime owner Glen Taylor, 79, recently acknowledged he has put the franchise on the market and Garnett became the most beloved and popular potential buyer the moment word got out he was interested. The 7-foot Hall of Famer is the best player in team history as he and the Wolves spent 12 successful, frustrating and highly entertaining seasons together (1995-2007). His trade to Boston got Garnett his championship ring and redefined his legacy. But neither time nor some recent bad blood with Taylor has ever diluted his \u201cI\u2019m \u2018Sota\u201d feelings about the state. Garnett would provide an instant link to the franchise\u2019s stretch of success: eight consecutive playoff appearances, a 2004 Western Conference finals run and a .526 winning percentage from 1997-2004. ( Minnesota\u2019s record before his arrival: .256 (105-305). Its record since \u201cprime KG\u201d left in \u201907: .342 (353-679).) We\u2019re not going to count his victory lap\/homecoming of 43 games from 2015 to 2016, when Garnett was on his last legs and the seeds of his future ownership role were initially planted. That plan, with the star player buying into an investor group featuring coach and President of Basketball Operations Flip Saunders, unraveled when Saunders died in October 2015 from complications of Hodgkins lymphoma. Taylor turned to other minority partners with an eye on future succession, leaving Garnett to slow-burn in feeling betrayed. In April, Garnett referred to Taylor as a \u201csnake [bleep],\u201d vowing to never do business with him or even participate in having his No. 21 jersey retired in Target Center\u2019s rafters. But in the wake of the news of Taylor\u2019s interest in finding a buyer, a more conciliatory KG emerged on social media . It would be a feel-good story when the Wolves, the NBA and Minneapolis need one. The franchise has missed the postseason in 15 of the past 16 attempts. The league is in the midst of tumult, financially and competitively. And the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police May 25 ignited the city as a national hot spot of unrest. The league has since voiced its intentions to hire more minorities into the coaching and management ranks, and commissioner Adam Silver has expressed a desire for more African-American ownership. Only NBA legend Michael Jordan is the sole Black majority owner, and he had to go back to his North Carolina roots to purchase the Charlotte Hornets. Garnett, if bidding successfully with a group of partners, would end up running the franchise with which he\u2019s most closely identified. There is a long way to go, as Taylor weighs offers from multiple groups over the next month or longer with the help of merchant bank Raine Group. The Wilf family that owns the NFL\u2019s Minnesota Vikings apparently is not interested, but several other suitors exist. Some perhaps have deeper pockets than Garnett, who for a season or two longer will rank as the highest paid player in NBA history (nearly $344 million in salary). Taylor has pledged to stipulate in any sale that the Wolves will stay in Minnesota, which might aid Garnett\u2019s pursuit. Until there\u2019s an agreement with anyone, though, here are five things for Garnett to seriously consider before he cuts a deal: These are, after all, the Timberwolves, one of the most woebegone franchises in U.S. sports history. The Wolves passed on Stephen Curry and dealt Ray Allen on draft night 1996 for Stephon Marbury. They established themselves as the lottery\u2019s unluckiest perennial participant, losing out on Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Alonzo Mourning in 1992 for the consolation prize of Christian Laettner. The Wolves so coveted Joe Smith in 1999 that they wound up losing three first-round Draft picks and paying a $3.5 million fine as penalties for their salary-cap circumvention. They traded Kevin Love for Andrew Wiggins and then handed the underperformer a $146 million contract extension based on little more than Taylor\u2019s Larry David-like look deeply into Wiggins\u2019 eyes. A few months earlier, they\u2019d shipped out Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn for 74 games of Jimmy Butler. Impressive NBA names have passed through the organization, including Garnett, Love, Kevin McHale, Saunders, Rick Adelman, Jack McCloskey, Tom Thibodeau and several more. Yet it barely has mattered. Taylor\u2019s most appreciated move by Wolves fans was buying the franchise at all. He purchased it for $88 million in 1994, stepping in amid rumors of a sale to a New Orleans group. McHale, Saunders and Garnett arrived soon thereafter, bringing that one extended run of success. Since then, only one playoff appearance ( in 2018 ). A 29th ranking in attendance this season, and only three finishes higher than 24th in the previous 14 years. In the decade since Jordan bought the Hornets, that team has made the playoffs just three times and is a cumulative 147 games under .500. Jordan bought in at a price of $275 million too, nearly a billion dollars less than what Garnett or whomever might have to spend. That\u2019s a lot of stupefying inertia and mediocrity. These are the most uncertain times the NBA has faced in a long while. Even the labor lockouts of 1998 and 2011 that cost the league hundreds of games and billions of dollars were business as usual, more or less, because the eventual resolutions were largely in the hands of the owners and the players. Those two seasons started late but ended traditionally, with no real shift in the sports calendar. Fans were poised and ready for the NBA to return, so they did too, picking up their ticket-buying and TV-viewing habits almost where they\u2019d left off.  This time, challenges abound. Not since the 1970s and early \u201880s has the NBA\u2019s future been so uncertain. The disruption of the coronavirus shutdown across most sports has broken fans\u2019 habits, and it\u2019s summer now. Spectators still aren\u2019t allowed into arenas and might not be in 2020-21, whenever that starts.  Fold in elements of the current social turmoil and that prompts even more questions. Certainly, it portends a seismic shift in revenue expectations and future earnings. Even with a hometown discount to Garnett, it\u2019s important to remember that Taylor did not become a billionaire three times over by buying or unloading assets at the wrong time. He has been, according to many who know him, as ruthless in the business world as KG was on basketball courts. Game better recognize game. Nobody officially calls it \u2018the Process\u2019 in Minnesota because of the derision that label eventually received in Philadelphia. Whatever you call it, though, the Wolves aren\u2019t even one full season into their latest incarnation under new President of Basketball Operations Gersson Rosas and his crew. In that time, Rosas has pushed all the right public-relations buttons, shifting the franchise to a warm, socially aware, \u201cfamily\u201d atmosphere to buy time with Minnesotans\u2019 general affability. He retained coach Ryan Saunders, a popular nod to Flip, despite the son\u2019s age and limited experience. Rosas was aggressive in the 2019 draft, moving up to snag Texas Tech\u2019s Jarrett Culver at No. 6, and is preaching patience (don\u2019t look for Culver on any All-Rookie teams). Then he was arguably more active than any of his peers at the trade deadline in February, bringing in D\u2019Angelo Russell, James Johnson, Malik Beasley, Juan Hernangomez and more. There is a blueprint for the future and a premature departure from it would be a mistake. Garnett would need to resist any urge to put his stamp on the basketball operation. It\u2019s one thing for a guy like Steve Ballmer to buy the LA Clippers and leave the basketball decisions to his basketball guys. Ballmer never played power forward, won a ring or earned a HOF enshrinement. Would Garnett be able to resist the temptation to assert his hoops authority too quickly? There\u2019s a double edge to this one. Garnett will be disappointed if he thinks he can easily find \u2014 maybe ever find \u2014 a relentless, versatile, legendary All-NBA player who will push himself to greatness, draw out the best performances from teammates and ride herd over the whole shebang in the locker room. Historically, great players have run into this talent and character gap when they tried to coach or manage mere mortals incapable of replicating iconic play. Now kick Garnett two steps beyond the sideline, where his ability to directly affect results would be even more limited. Much of Jordan\u2019s first decade as an owner has been spent evolving to where he knows none of the Hornets will be another \u201cAirness\u201d. There\u2019s always an implicit pressure to please the boss that other owners don\u2019t generate. \u201cI know he wants to win and I feel that,\u201d Hornets GM Mitch Kupchak told the Charlotte Observer back in October. \u201cI know our coach [James Borrego] feels it, too. It\u2019s not like that coming from some guy who made a lot of money on Wall Street. It\u2019s Michael Jordan.\u201d Then there\u2019s the other adjustment Garnett would have to make: No longer able to comport himself solely as a player or entertainer, he\u2019d have to sand off his rough edges to navigate smoothly at the corporate level and Board of Governors meetings. At least no more rough edges than, say, Mark Cuban. If that\u2019s going to happen, best to get it done as part of the news conference where they sign the paperwork, shake hands and Taylor gifts Garnett the keys to the executive restroom. Otherwise, awkward. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Sure, one could make a case for Zion Williamson, who burst onto the scene \u2014 on Jan. 22 after missing the Pelicans\u2019 first 44 games \u2014 with 19 games of exceptional basketball. Williamson was dazzling and he\u2019ll finish first in scoring (23.6 ppg) and rebounding (6.8), but near the bottom in one key statistic: games played. Nineteen games. It\u2019s just too little, too late for Williamson, and even if the games in Orlando counted toward voting, it wouldn\u2019t have been enough to strengthen his case. While Zion was nursing a knee injury, Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant was grabbing the nation\u2019s attention. The No. 2 pick out of Murray State was electrifying yet composed. He was clutch, becoming one of the league\u2019s best fourth-quarter scorers. And he was dazzling, pulling off monster dunks and igniting rallies with his energetic, confident style of play. He did it all while willing the Grizzlies into playoff contention. No other rookie has the resume or statistics to even come close to touching Morant. There were a lot of unknowns this strange season, but one thing\u2019s for sure: Ja Morant is your Kia Rookie of the Year. * * * Last edition: No. 1 The Grizzlies will enter the restart as the No. 8 seed in the West, but they\u2019ll have plenty of company fighting for the final playoff spot. Fortunately, Morant has welcomed all challenges in his rookie season and proven he won\u2019t back down. Before the season, many thought the Grizzlies were doomed for the lottery, but Morant changed that narrative. In 59 games, the point guard finishes 2nd among rookies in scoring (17.6 ppg) and first in assists (6.8 apg) while shooting 49.1% overall and 36.7% on 3-pointers. More than the numbers, though, Morant has changed the Grizzlies. His confidence and fearlessness \u2014 especially in big fourth-quarter moments \u2014 have brought life to the city and energized the fanbase and turned him into a star. If the Grizzlies can hang on to the 8th spot in the West, a potential showdown with LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers would be the perfect way to cap off his Rookie of the Year season. Last edition: No. 2 I\u2019m sure many voters will slide Zion Williamson into this 2nd slot, but Nunn is more deserving, due to his overall body of work. In 62 games (all starts), Nunn averaged 15.6 points on 44.8% shooting (36.2% on 3-pointers) and was one of the biggest surprises of this rookie class. After going undrafted in 2018 and spending a season in the NBA G League, Nunn emerged with a strong NBA Summer League and didn\u2019t slow down once handed the reins ahead of the 33-year-old Goran Dragic. The undrafted rookie gave the Heat a scoring option and helped lead them to a 41-24 record, something he mentions in his ROY case. \u201cI think people will say that [Morant] is Rookie of the Year, but I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Nunn said in April . \u201cThe most value should be in the wins. And we\u2019re both starting guards on teams, and our team has been holding it down. We\u2019re a playoff team, so go ahead and give that Rookie of the Year to Kendrick Nunn.\u201d I won\u2019t go that far, especially since Morant has Memphis on the verge of a playoff spot, but he definitely deserves the 2nd rung with his eye-opening rookie season. Last edition: No. 3 Since we\u2019re now able to take a look back at the season as a whole, it\u2019s clear to see that Williamson\u2019s limited action is too big of a hurdle to overcome. Nineteen games just isn\u2019t enough to put him past a 62-game starter like Nunn. Still, what Zion did in those 19 games is enough to land him in the Top 3. Williamson was dominant from the start, and only seemed to be getting better as the season suspension arrived. Williamson finishes the season averaging 23.6 ppg and 6.8 rpg while shooting 58.9%. He changed the Pelicans and had them in position to challenge for the final playoff spot in the West. Zion\u2019s prospects are bright, and there may be hardware in his future, but it won\u2019t be this season. Last edition: No. 4 White had an up-and-down season, but finished strong, becoming one of the most promising breakout guards of this class. Down the stretch, White scored 20-plus in eight of his last nine games, and, outside Zion Williamson (25.2 ppg), was the best scoring rookie after the All-Star break (24.7 ppg) while shooting 46.8% from the field (40.7% on 3-pointers). His shooting numbers on the season are concerning (39.4% FG, 36.5% on 3-pointers), but he was a game changer when he had it going. One player impressed by White was Zach LaVine, who sees big things to come from his backcourt mate. \u201c Man, Coby\u2019s my guy\u201d LaVine told BallDontStop in an Instagram Live chat . \u201cHe had one of the best training camps I\u2019ve seen from a rookie; I\u2019ve told a lot of people that. He came with it from Day 1. Obviously, he had the ups and downs and sometimes you\u2019re put in a position where you\u2019re not allowed to show your entire game as part of the NBA, I feel like a lot of guys are going through that. But them last 15 games, and even before that, he had so many showings where it\u2019s like \u2018man, this kid is off the charts.\u2019 He\u2019s a human flamethrower, man. He\u2019s got stepbacks, hesitations, he has finishing, he can shoot the hell out of the ball, he\u2019s fast, his potential is limitless, man. I\u2019m excited to play with him and be in the backcourt where I think we can be a problem.\u201d Last edition: No. 5 It was a tough call to give Barrett the nod over Rui Hachimura (who missed 23 games with injuries) for the final spot in the Top 5, but Barrett showed signs of improvement over the last month, which gives him the bump. On the season, Barrett finishes as the fourth best scorer (14.3 ppg), while grabbing 5.0 rebounds (5th among rookies) and managed to get his shooting percentage over 40% with a March in which he shot 44.8% from the field (averaging 18.7 ppg this month). It was a tough season for Barrett and the Knicks, but the potential is there, and his improvement should give fans hope.

It\u2019s a wristband because it looks like one. Or a handcuff because you figuratively cannot take it off. Let\u2019s call it a wristcuff. Actually, there is an official name: MagicBand. It\u2019s your passport inside the NBA campus. Everyone was issued one upon arrival and must wear one at all times in public. It literally opens doors by acting as the key to your room; just tap the band just above the door handle and presto, you\u2019re back in your home for the next few months.  The bands were commonly worn by selective Walt Disney World visitors who wanted more exclusivity and flexibility, and it gave them more perks than other park visitors. The bands are worn to access rides, order meals and other such courtesies. If you wear them you don\u2019t need to wait in long lines or carry a wallet. Inside each band is a computer chip of some sort. A half-dozen years ago Disney paid a small fortune to create them and have them engineered to act computer-like; think of them as the world\u2019s first smart wristband. Well: With tourism down considerably since the coronavirus hit, those bands were collecting dust \u2026 until the NBA arrived. They were reprogrammed to the specifications of the NBA campus. They are essentially snitches. If you fail to record your temperature and health chart daily on your cell phone, the band will not give you the green light clearance when touched against a box at the entrance of every practice facility and arena front gate. I\u2019ve been caught twice, and unfortunately, you can\u2019t come up with an alibi or blame it on faulty wiring. But that\u2019s all good. These bands keep you on your toes and on top of your health charts. And therefore, they keep this place safe. They\u2019re further proof that the NBA spared no expense to make protection the priority here in Orlando. My band is now like family. It travels with me everywhere \u2014 not that I have a choice \u2014 and has become an automatic daily part of my life, like deodorant. In fact, it\u2019s more mandatory than deodorant, even here in the stifling humidity. But make no mistake: When I leave this place, thankfully my wrist will be naked once again; enough is enough. And no matter how nostalgic I might feel upon returning home, there will be no urge to get the band back together again. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It\u2019s not much different from the first two incarnations of the JNGC, only this time everything will be virtual. After COVID-19 shut down U.S. sports in March, the NBA staff almost immediately began discussing how they could stage the global tournament that highlights the Jr. NBA\u2019s four core values of teamwork, respect, determination, and community. \u201cWe considered all scenarios, but we were determined to find a way to deliver an exciting event while prioritizing the health and safety of the Jr. NBA community,\u201d said David Krichavsky, the NBA\u2019s Head of Youth Basketball Development. For one, within a few weeks of the pandemic, the Jr. NBA team successfully launched its Jr. NBA at Home Program , which provided hundreds of videos teaching basketball drills and good habits to youth. Secondly, \u201cwe feel a responsibility to the Jr. NBA community,\u201d said Krichavsky. \u201cThey are passionate about basketball and we know the Jr. NBA Global Championship is an event they look forward to, so we pushed forward to deliver it in the best and safest way possible.\u201d It took a massive effort that involved collaboration from departments across the NBA. The tournament, which has Gatorade returning as a partner, runs through mid-August. It features top teams of 13- and 14-year-old male and female players from eight U.S. regions (Central, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, Northwest, South, Southeast and West) and eight international regions (Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, China, Europe & the Middle East, India, Latin America, and Mexico). All told, dozens of countries will be represented. \u201cThe Jr. NBA Global Championship is an immersive experience, unlike any other tournament,\u201d said Adam Harper, NBA Senior Director and Youth Development Team Leader. \u201cWhile the event will certainly look and feel different than years past, we are excited about the virtual platform and hope to provide impactful and memorable experiences to youth basketball players around the world.\u201d The teams will compete in a series of virtual basketball competitions using HomeCourt , a mobile basketball training app that uses advanced artificial intelligence to track key performance metrics such as speed, vertical jump, shot accuracy, release time and ball handling. The boys and girls teams will participate in bracket-style competitions with the respective U.S. and international winners advancing to a global championship in August. Additionally, HomeCourt will power a digital Jr. NBA Global Championship Skills Challenge to extend the excitement of this year\u2019s virtual event to fans and players of all ages. The activities will culminate next month with a Jr. NBA Day of Celebration as part of the 2019-20 NBA restart at ESPN Wide World of Sports, which hosted the two previous Jr. NBA Global Championships. One of the teams competing this year is The Skill Factory, a metro Atlanta squad representing the Southeast. Bella Martin, 14, plays point guard for the team.  \u201cI really like the virtual aspect and I\u2019m most looking forward to competing against girls I\u2019ve never seen play before,\u201d said Martin, who has used HomeCourt while at home. \u201cIf we win, that will be great. But just being with my team and competing alongside my teammates, I\u2019m most excited to be a part of that.\u201d She and her teammates haven\u2019t been together since the shutdown but their coach, Tad Spencer, has held weekly Zoom meetings to make sure the girls stay connected. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of used to the virtual world already,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe tournament is a wonderful opportunity to spread our wings and see where we stand as a team.\u201d Competition isn\u2019t the only focus. The tournament will develop all aspects of the young athletes with a virtual campus where the players can use avatars to interact with the other players, no matter where they are in the world. The virtual campus will feature lifestyle, culture and music components, trivia, scavenger hunts and other interactive competitions as well as content from all NBA and WNBA teams. \u201cThe virtual campus is one of the more unique components we have going on for this year\u2019s Jr. NBA Global Championship. The youth will be able to experience presentations and also connect with each other in the virtual campus,\u201d said Dawn Smyth, the NBA\u2019s International Grassroots Basketball Lead. \u201cThe Jr. NBA Global Championship is the only Jr. NBA property that has different regions interacting with each other. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re able to share this cultural basketball experience.\u201d For their community service, players will also submit an image that represents their ideals of global unity and social change. Live Art International will use the images to create a mural that will be donated to a community organization. Players will also participate in leadership and life skills lessons, including conversations about social justice, race and mental health and wellness. While each region will tailor the presentation to their community, the overall focus will be on inclusion, diversity and equity. This year, however, does have a twist: JNGC alumni from the U.S. who played in 2018 and 2019 will participate in the life skills conversations alongside NBA and WNBA players. The dialogue will be led by youth facilitators and center on the opportunity for the next generation of players and leaders to drive collective action and create long-term change.  Candice Haynes said developing the young teens holistically is one of the most important aspects of the Jr. NBA Global Championship because many of the players hope to play basketball professionally. \u201cWe can let them know that there\u2019s more they can get from the game than just being a basketball player,\u201d said Haynes, the NBA\u2019s Domestic Youth Player Development Program Manager. \u201cWe are really intentional when it comes to mental health and wellness and developing the total athlete. When we explain why we are doing something, for instance, why it\u2019s important for you to develop your mental wellness and then tying it with their performance, it might resonate more.\u201d The conversations take on an even greater importance this year, Haynes added. She called 2020 \u2018a perfect storm\u2019 with the pandemic and the movement for social justice. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of youth speaking out on how everything has affected them,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a lot of them, sports might be that safe haven and they don\u2019t have that this year. They lost their scholastic season, they lost their summer season, they\u2019re not around their coaches, their teammates. We really wanted to lean into that and be there for them as an open space for kids to be heard.\u201d"},{"id":26901,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-scrimmage-games-start-orlando","date":"2020-07-23","title":"Scrimmage games debut with squeaking sneakers, vocal benches providing soundtrack in fanless arena","content":" ORLANDO \u2014 For those with a heavy emotional investment in the basketball world, what just happened inside a makeshift NBA arena was a sight for starving eyes, and also an odd one for all other human senses. You couldn\u2019t hear the boom of approval when Paul George slithered into the lane and performed a forceful dunk because all applause was confined to the Clippers\u2019 bench. You couldn\u2019t smell the arresting aroma of comfort food and upscale cuisine because there was nothing being grilled on the mezzanine, nor was there a mezzanine, period. And you couldn\u2019t see a sea of fans crammed together in the stands or sitting crossed-legged at courtside while sipping wine because, well, you should know by now. This dry run of basketball disguised as a scrimmage between the Clippers and Magic on Wednesday was officially the first organized NBA game since March 11 , but the world changed that day and so has the presentation of basketball. Based on what everyone saw when the NBA kinda-sorta reopened for business \u2014 a professional basketball game being held without fans \u2014 this will take some getting used to, you suppose? \u201cIt was really quiet, so you\u2019ve got to bring your own energy,\u201d said Magic forward Aaron Gordon. \u201cYou can hear everything that\u2019s being said on the floor.\u201d The Arena at the Wide World Of Sports Complex was tricked out for the Clippers-Magic sneak peek and same goes for the two other venues that\u2019ll host the refurbished season when the games resume next Thursday. Since there are no fans, everything is designed and made for TV, which creates an artificial atmosphere. What other choice is there? You might get the urge to plug in a Playstation to feel the full effect. Video dominates the lower level of the arena, where hi-def panels are stretched to surround three-fourths of the floor. It was a tech bubble, with boldly lit graphics giving the appearance of a NBA2K game just beyond the court. Speaking of the court, Black Lives Matter is tattooed in bold print and loudly enough to be seen and heard, in case there\u2019s someone out there who is unaware what the league and its players are promoting and protesting. Other than that and the league logo, the court is bare and the lane is unpainted. Here were the arresting images and sounds from the first-game tuneup, won by the Clippers, 99-90, that will follow the NBA as it untangles and finishes this interrupted season with 22 teams in one spot: No cheerleaders, mascots, goofy halftime acts, fan shooting contests, ushers or yellow-jacketed security around to yank anyone who\u2019s sitting in the wrong seat. The seats on the team benches are socially-distanced and layered in three rows and tucked into the corner, away from the assistant coaches (also spaced). Each seat on the bench has its own water-bottle holder; players must use their own for the entire game. During timeouts, five folding chairs are hustled onto the floor for the players, six if the coach wants to sit as he scribbles on his eraserboard. Everyone else must stand. The scorer\u2019s table will be surrounded by plexiglass as protection and as an added bonus, also a shield against a wayward player lunging for a loose ball.  The ballboys and ballgirls, all locally sourced, must wear rubber gloves and sit in chairs off the court and behind the basket while socially distanced from each other. Nobody is on the floor except the referees, players and head coaches. Assistant coaches must stay seated. There are no photographers under the basket and the three court-side TV cameras are controlled remotely. The referees are mic\u2019d so the folks behind the plexiglass can hear them when there\u2019s an infraction. The home team, in this case the Clippers, got the home graphics on the video boards, and when one of their own scored a basket, he heard a little extra volume from the PA announcer. Interesting scene: The PA actually said, \u201cPlease welcome your Clippers\u201d and \u2026 no applause. There\u2019s a joke there that Laker fans are telling each other, but their time is coming, too. Interesting scene, No. 2: Joakim Noah waved a hand in the air after being announced as a Clippers\u2019 starter \u2026 as though someone was supposed to notice. Interesting scene, No. 3: The PA said, \u201cPlease welcome the visiting team, the Orlando Magic.\u201d The upper deck is blacked out with tarp, the TV announcing crew must sit several rows from the court and are spaced apart, and additional media are limited to a handful of seats tucked in a corner. Yes, as the adopted NBA slogan says, it\u2019s a whole new game, indeed. At least until the ball goes up and instinct takes over. Clippers coach Doc Rivers: \u201cOnce the game starts, it\u2019s all basketball. Early on I thought all the players sat in their seats, and as the game went on, everyone was up together. I thought that was great overall, our spirit was great during the game. You can hear your teammates cheer for you, and so I thought that was OK.\u201d Magic coach Steve Clifford: \u201cI thought it was much more comfortable than I thought it would be. I think the teams that can adapt to playing in a unique, kind of different environment without all of the fans, whoever can get the right mindset so they can just concentrate on playing will have a big advantage.\u201d The whole experience in Orlando is one big adjustment for everyone involved. Until Wednesday, that process was confined to living in a hotel and getting tested for the virus and trying to reassemble after four months off. But with the scrimmages underway and the seeding games and then playoff games soon to follow, that adjustment will heighten. Each team will play three scrimmages to prepare for the seeding games next. More than anything, the players must conform to a more sedate atmosphere which is artificially and occasionally enhanced with piped-in pump-up music and chants. Otherwise, it\u2019s squeaky sneakers and plenty of yelling. \u201cIt\u2019s the most vocal I\u2019ve been forced to be during a game,\u201d said Clippers guard Lou Williams. \u201cUsually when fans are yelling and screaming support, that\u2019s an opportunity for me to relax. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do that.\u201d After overhearing that, his raspy-voiced coach chimed in: \u201cNow you know how I feel,\u201d said Rivers, \u201cand why I talk like this.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Below are game recaps from all games played on July 22. * * * The LA Clippers defeated the Orlando Magic, 99-90 , on Wednesday afternoon in the opening scrimmage of the NBA restart in Orlando. The squads broke ice on the NBA\u2019s four-month-plus shutdown with both teams playing the majority of their regulars in the 40-minute scrimmage. Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic were among those who had a solid workload. Lou Williams scored a game-high 22 points, while George had 18 points and five rebounds as the Clippers turned in a dominant 32-16 advantage in the second quarter. The Magic chipped six points off their 11-point halftime deficit in the third quarter, but Los Angeles outpaced them by four points in the fourth to secure the win. Leonard, Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris each had nine points for the Clippers. Joakim Noah started at center with both Ivica Zubac and Montrezl Harrell away from Orlando and totaled four points, five rebounds and three assists.

Tied 68-68 with six minutes remaining, the Nuggets put the game away with a 21-14 run.

Nikola Jokic collected 16 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. The 7-foot-2 Bol Bol, who did not play during the regular season because of a foot injury, made his Nuggets\u2019 debut with 16 points, 10 rebounds and six blocks as a starter. The Wizards were led by Rui Hachimura, who totaled 18 points and nine rebounds. Troy Brown posted 12 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. Ish Smith was the only other player in double figures, leading the bench with 10 points, two rebounds, three assists and two steals. Both teams are off until Saturday, with Washington playing the LA Clippers and Denver facing the New Orleans Pelicans. \u2014 By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire * * * The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 99-68 , on Wednesday in the opening scrimmage for both teams in Orlando. The Pelicans pulled ahead late in the first quarter and took a nine-point lead into the second, where they kept up the momentum to build a 56-35 lead by halftime. The Pelicans pushed their lead to 24 points in the third, but the Nets rallied to make it a 17-point game heading into the final frame. New Orleans bounced back with an 8-0 run to start the fourth and went on to outscore the Nets by a 28-14 margin in the final period to secure the 31-point victory. Rookie guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker and veteran E\u2019Twaun Moore tallied 14 points apiece to lead the Pelicans, who were without Zion Williamson. Brandon Ingram added 12 points, while Lonzo Ball finished with eight points, three rebounds, three assists and a block.  Meanwhile, for the Nets, Dzanan Musa led the way with 11 points in 27 minutes. Starting at center, Jarrett Allen tallied a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds, while Caris LeVert and Rodions Kurucs each chipped in 10 points. LeVert struggled from the field, hitting just five of 18 attempts in 22 minutes of action. The Nets next scrimmage will take place on Saturday against the Spurs. The Pelicans will also square off against the Nuggets on Saturday. \u2014 By Dan Bruno, RotoWire * * * The Miami Heat defeated the Sacramento Kings, 104-98 , on Wednesday in the opening scrimmage for both teams in Orlando. The Heat got off to a strong start and quickly gained control of the game, jumping to a 27-21 lead after the first quarter. Miami would stretch its lead even further in the second, gaining a 12-point advantage heading into the halftime break. The Kings showed signs of a potential comeback in the third, however. Sacramento outscored Miami 27-17 in the third period, trimming the deficit to just two points entering the fourth quarter. The Heat closed things out effectively, though, scoring 31 points in a 10-minute fourth quarter to hang on for the 104-98 victory. A Kyle Guy jumper pulled the Kings within four with just over 24 seconds remaining. But Kelly Olynyk was able to ice the game at the free throw line, where he knocked down a pair with 12 seconds to play. Duncan Robinson led Miami with 18 points, while shooting 5-of-8 from 3-point range. Veteran point guard Goran Dragic added 11 points, and Tyler Herro notched 15 points off the bench. Jimmy Butler filled the stat sheet, ending with nine points, three rebounds, two assists and one steal in just 12 minutes of action. Buddy Hield paced the Kings with 19 points off the bench, while Nemanja Bjelica (13 points) and Kent Bazemore (11 points, four rebounds) also posted double-digit scoring performances. In 18 minutes off the bench, DaQuan Jeffries added 12 points of his own to go with a pair of assists. Both teams will play their next scrimmage Saturday. Miami will face the Jazz, while the Heat will match up against the East-leading Milwaukee Bucks. \u2014 By Juan Aravena, RotoWire * * *"},{"id":26892,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-coaches-racial-equality-priority-restart","date":"2020-07-22","title":"To NBA coaches, racial equality is a priority of the restart","content":"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle now starts every interview session by reading from a calendar that highlights something that happened on that day in the country\u2019s racial history. Toronto\u2019s Nick Nurse is often wearing shirts to practice proclaiming that Black Lives Matter. Orlando\u2019s Steve Clifford, in lieu of pre-practice film, showed his team a documentary on the life of John Lewis. While NBA players are using the season restart to demand change, coaches in the league are not making them walk down that path alone. Coaches around the NBA \u2014 where most players are Black and most coaches are white \u2014 have been active participants in the demand societal change around the league. The demands became a flashpoint when George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man , died when a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. \u201cI think it\u2019s just understanding the moment and the movement that is taking place,\u201d Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. \u201cThat\u2019s what all our coaches are doing, and as white coaches, they\u2019re no fools. I think the beauty of our game is, we coach African American men, myself and the white coaches. We\u2019re around it. We know our league is predominantly African American. So why not? If we\u2019re going to ask for others to be empathetic, I think we all have to be empathetic.\u201d Pierce isn\u2019t at the NBA restart at Walt Disney World \u2014 the Hawks aren\u2019t among the 22 teams still playing this season \u2014 but he\u2019s been active on regular leaguewide coaches Zoom calls and leads a committee of coaches tasked with how those in the NBA can best aid the societal-change movement. He also helped get someone to coach the coaches. Bryan Stevenson is the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, an NBA community partner, and is someone who has spent 30 years pushing for social justice. He was scheduled to meet with the NBA\u2019s coaches over a Zoom call for a half-hour a few weeks ago. The call went more than three times that long, and from there a running dialogue was born. \u201cIt was mesmerizing,\u201d Carlisle said of that initial call. \u201cIt was an education in itself.\u201d It\u2019s the calendar created by Stevenson\u2019s organization that Carlisle reads from each day. The impact by whatever Stevenson said to coaches that first night has continued resonating. \u201cYou have to believe things you haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cYou have to have hope that we can turn this moment into something more than a moment. I mean, hopelessness is the enemy of justice and injustice prevails where hopelessness persists. And if NBA coaches believe that and if NBA players believe that, then fans can believe it too.\u201d He\u2019s convinced the coaches believe. Stevenson has been lauded publicly by virtually all the league\u2019s coaches in recent weeks for helping educate them on things that they never knew. In a league where a handful of coaches \u2014 Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr and San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich, most notably \u2014 are not shy about sharing political views publicly, this moment has driven other coaches to use their voices as well. The NBA got permission to make the \u201cJohn Lewis: Good Trouble\u201d documentary available to all head and assistant coaches this week and several teams \u2014 including the Magic, at Clifford\u2019s request \u2014 screened the film. It was also available as a featured movie on the curated channel within the hotels. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by how this movement still has great stamina, and I think our ability to go there and still keep the conversation alive with our platforms is important,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThe next step that everybody wants to see is action and lasting, sustainable change in areas of systemic racism and social inequalities.\u201d Players are at Disney to compete for a championship, though the broader societal issues have not diminished since they arrived. Denver\u2019s Jerami Grant took five questions in an interview last week and all his answers, no matter the topic, revolved around a demand for arrests in the killing of Breonna Taylor. Philadelphia\u2019s Tobias Harris took a similar tactic a few days later. Houston\u2019s Russell Westbrook has a clothing line that will display social-justice messaging and most players will wear jerseys with similar thoughts printed on the back as well. If the players take an action on the court during games, such as kneeling, a person with knowledge of the situation said coaches have agreed to do the same. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no plans have been announced. \u201cIt\u2019s a seminal moment, in the sense that we have an opportunity to do something transformative if we have the courage,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAnd as with many things in today\u2019s world, interest wanes pretty quickly no matter what the topic. \u2026 So, the league, the players, the coaches, staff, everybody is very committed to keeping it up-front in everybody\u2019s consciousness, even though everybody\u2019s excited to go play. This is a great opportunity.\u201d At Disney the NBA will have the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on the courts for games. Stevenson believes coaches can have that same impact. The way NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sees it, fans will take their cues from watching their various favorite teams \u2014 players and coaches alike. If the NBA is speaking change into existence and acting accordingly, he believes fans will apply that same passion to whatever role they can play into the movement. \u201cWe can use that same desire and hope for racial equality and an end to police violence and justice for communities that have been undermined by unhealthy unsafe practices and policies,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really powerful thing to imagine. And so, if we can achieve that, yes, I absolutely believe that can be a transformative moment.\u201d"},{"id":26885,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-orleans-pelicans-zion-williamson-update","date":"2020-07-22","title":"Zion Williamson has no timetable for return to NBA campus","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Zion Williamson could still make re-opening night of the NBA season. The New Orleans Pelicans said Wednesday that Williamson, who left the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World last week, is being tested daily for the coronavirus and continues showing negative results. If that continues, Williamson may have to quarantine for only four days when he returns to the team. And if that return comes in the next few days, that means he could still have a shot of playing when New Orleans faces Utah on July 30 in the first of the 88 seeding games at Disney. \u201cWhile there is no current timetable for his return to campus, he fully intends to rejoin the team,\u201d the Pelicans said in a statement. \u201cPer NBA protocol, his quarantine period will be determined upon his return.\u201d The minimum quarantine Williamson would have to serve for leaving, even though he was officially excused, is the four-day option.

After finishing 15 games out of a playoff spot last season, the Grizzlies will begin the seeding games in Orlando with a 3 1\/2-game lead for eighth place in the Western Conference. Improvement has come on the offensive end of the floor, where the Grizzlies have seen the league\u2019s fifth biggest jump in points scored per 100 possessions ( from 105.6 to 108.9 ). And it\u2019s come with a huge change in style of play. From last season, the Grizzlies have seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in pace (possessions per 48 minutes), the league\u2019s biggest jump in fast break points per game , the league\u2019s biggest jump in second chance points per game , and the league\u2019s biggest jump in points in the paint per game . The first two numbers account for a large portion of the third. So does the relentlessness of Rookie of the Year favorite Ja Morant. The point guard\u2019s desire and ability to get into the paint fuels the Memphis offense. He\u2019s scored or assisted on 51% of his team\u2019s points in the paint while he\u2019s been on the floor. The Grizzlies\u2019 paint production is still both a collective and multi-dimensional effort. Morant ranks sixth among individuals with 18.4 drives per game, but the Grizzlies rank just 12th as a team. Yet they\u2019ve still scored 3.1 more points in the paint per game than any other team. Let us count the ways in which they do so \u2026 Morant ranks 12th in the league with 9.4 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game, according to Synergy play-type tracking. The 0.87 points per possession he\u2019s scored as a pick-and-roll ball-handler rank just 36th among 49 players who\u2019ve averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. But Morant\u2019s ability to get into the paint and find creative ways to finish is the foundation for what the Grizzlies do in the half court. Play 1. Morant gives up the ball to get it back with a new dribble. Damian Lillard goes over Jonas Valanciunas\u2019 screen and trails the play, and Morant attacks Hassan Whiteside\u2019s drop coverage. With a pass fake and a Eurostep, he throws off Whiteside\u2019s timing and finishes with a scoop high off the glass. Number to know: Morant\u2019s 7.4 points per game in the restricted area are the second most among rookie guards in the last 10 years, trailing only Ben Simmons\u2019 9.3 per game from two seasons ago. Play 2. Morant again gives the ball up early in the possession. But he gets it back on a dribble hand-off from Gorgui Dieng. CJ McCollum goes over the screen and Morant uses a huge dribble to put Caleb Swanigan on his heels before rising up for a soft runner. Number to know: Morant ranks 14th with 211 non-restricted-area shots in the paint. The 45.0% he\u2019s shot on those ranks 26th among 95 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 100. Play 3. Brandon Clarke doesn\u2019t make contact with the high screen, but Morant gains separation from Cory Joseph himself by putting on the brakes. He goes the other way and sinks a double-clutch floater in the lane. Number to know: 74% of Morant\u2019s shots have come in the paint. That\u2019s the 10th highest rate among 137 players (and behind only Simmons among guards) with at least 500 total field goal attempts. Play 4. Markelle Fultz trails Morant around two screens and Morant floats a shot over Nikola Vucevic\u2019s drop coverage. Number to know: Non-restricted-area paint shots account for 23% of the Grizzlies\u2019 total field goal attempts and 41% of their total shots in the paint. Those are both the highest rates in the league, with the former being the highest rate by a wide margin. The 44.6% they\u2019ve shot on non-restricted-area paint shots ranks second . Play 5. Morant uses a \u201cpistol\u201d screen from Kyle Anderson along the right sideline and splits the defenders with a low, through-the-legs dribble. Fultz gets his hand on the ball, but Morant regains control and finishes with his left hand. Number to know: Morant has shot 28-for-52 (53.8%) on clutch shots, the third best mark among 28 players who have attempted at least 50. That breaks down to 28-for-45 (62.2%) on clutch 2-pointers and 0-for-7 on clutch 3-pointers. Play 6. Trae Young \u201cices\u201d the screen from Anderson to keep Morant from getting to the middle of the floor. So Morant rejects the screen, gets John Collins leaning the wrong way with a yo-yo dribble, draws a foul, and finishes. Number to know: Morant\u2019s free throw rate of 33.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field ranks 18th among 137 players with at least 500 total field goal attempts. The Grizzlies rank fourth with 9.2 points per game from roll men, according to Synergy play-type tracking. Among 45 players who\u2019ve averaged at least two roll-man possessions per game, Clarke (1.48) and Valanciunas (1.24) rank second and 12th in points per roll-man possession. Dieng scored 1.26 points per possession (11th) as a roll man with Minnesota, but hasn\u2019t been as efficient in his 12 games with Memphis. The Grizzlies have four players in the top 50 in assist ratio (Tyus Jones ranks fifth), but Morant\u2019s pick-and-roll passing is pretty advanced for a rookie. Play 1. When McCollum ices Valanciunas\u2019 screen, Morant rejects it and draws help from Whiteside. Whiteside is able to get back in front of Valanciunas, but not before he has his feet in the restricted area. A pump fake gets Whiteside in the air and allows Valanciunas to finish. Number to know: Clarke and Valanciunas are two of the three players (Indiana\u2019s T.J. Warren is the other) who have shot 70% or better on at least 200 attempts in the restricted area and 50% or better on at least 100 attempts elsewhere in the paint. Play 2. McCollum goes under the screen on Clarke\u2019s initial hand-off back to Morant. But Clarke flips the screen, McCollum gets caught behind it, and Carmelo Anthony steps up. Anfernee Simons initially sinks to tag Clarke\u2019s roll to the rim, but Morant looks him off, Simons takes a step back toward Josh Jackson on the wing, and Morant hits a wide-open Clarke under the basket. Number to know: Clarke\u2019s field goal percentage of 62.3% ranks fifth in the league and would be the highest mark in NBA history for a qualified rookie, surpassing the mark set by Steve Johnson (61.3%) in 1981-82. Play 3. McCollum again goes under a screen from Clarke, this one an off-the-ball cross-screen. So Morant stops where he is and McCollum is now on the wrong side of the pick. Anthony again steps up to help and Morant tosses a lob to Clarke rolling down the middle of the lane. Number to know: Clarke has shot 74.4% in the restricted area , the best mark for a rookie with at least 200 restricted-area attempts in the 24 years for which we have shot-location data. Five of the six instances of a rookie shooting 70% or better on at least 200 restricted-area attempts have come in the last three seasons. Play 4. Like McCollum in the last two plays, Joseph wants to go under screens for the rookie. So Morant takes Joseph down to the corner before using Dieng\u2019s screen to get into the paint. Alex Len bites for what looks like a running hook and Morant drops the ball off to Dieng for an easy dunk. Number to know: Morant has assisted on 34.8% of his teammates\u2019 field goals while he\u2019s been on the floor. That\u2019s the eighth highest rate among 226 players who have averaged at least 20 minutes in 25 games or more. Play 5. Alex Caruso goes over Valanciunas\u2019 screen and Morant draws JaVale McGee away from the basket with a \u201csnake\u201d move around the pick. That clears a path for Valanciunas. Number to know: Morant has 95 assists to Valanciunas , 12th most from one player to a single teammate. No other teammate has more than 28 assists to the Grizzlies\u2019 starting center. Play 6. The Magic defend this Morant\/Valanciunas pick-and-roll pretty well, but the big man rolls into decent position against Vucevic and finishes through contact with a spin move. Number to know: Despite taking a league-high 56% of their shots in the paint, the Grizzlies rank 25th in free throw rate (23.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field), having seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop from last season (27.2, seventh ). The Grizzlies are one of four teams that rank in the top 10 in both the percentage of their possessions that have been in transition (18.1%, fifth ) and points scored per transition possession (1.12, 10th ). Brooks (3.2) and Morant (3.1) lead the team in transition possessions per game, but the pace picks up when the reserves are on the floor. When Tyus Jones and De\u2019Anthony Melton have been on the floor together, the Grizzlies have forced 15.6 turnovers per 100 possessions and registered 23.2 fast breaks per 48 minutes . Those are both the highest on-court marks among 37 Memphis two-man combinations that have played at least 300 total minutes together. As an individual, Melton has averaged 4.3 fast break points per 36 minutes, eighth most among 286 players who have played at least 750 total minutes this season. Play 1. Anderson grabs the rebound and immediately gets the ball to Morant, who takes off. He gets Trevor Ariza on his heels and blows by him with an in-and-out dribble into a crossover. Number to know: The 1.15 points per possession Morant has scored in transition rank 17th among 40 players who\u2019ve averaged at least three transition possessions per game. Play 2. Clarke contests Ariza from behind (and maybe gets away with a foul). The rookie doesn\u2019t have a head start when Melton grabs the rebound, but Clarke beats every Blazer to the other basket and Melton rewards him for running the floor. Number to know: The Grizzlies have been 10.4 points per 100 possessions better with Melton on the floor (+6.2) than with him off the floor (-4.2). That\u2019s tied for the eighth biggest on-off-court NetRtg differential among 218 players who have played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. Play 3. Off a made free throw , Anderson quickly inbounds to Morant, who immediately passes ahead to Brooks. The Kings aren\u2019t ready and Brooks beats Harrison Barnes off the dribble. Number to know: Brooks is one of five players who have shot worse than 50% on at least 100 attempts in the restricted area. Play 4. Morant helps on the glass and passes ahead to Jones. Brooklyn stops the initial push, but Valanciunas beats Jarrett Allen down the floor and finishes over the smaller Nets. Number to know: Jones leads the league in assist\/turnover ratio at 5.18. Play 5. Before Jones even has control of the rebound, the Grizzlies are on their way. Jones passes ahead to Josh Jackson, who has Morant running ahead for a dunk. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Grizzlies rank fifth with 5.0 passes ahead per game. Jones ranks eighth among individuals with 2.0 passes ahead per 36 minutes. League-wide, as teams have chosen to prioritize transition defense, offensive rebounding percentage has gone down quite a bit over the last eight years. But there are still points to be had on the offensive glass, especially if you have a huge guy who\u2019s stationed near the basket most of the time anyway. Among 226 players who\u2019ve averaged at least 20 minutes per game, Valanciunas ranks ninth in offensive rebounding percentage , having grabbed 11.1% of available offensive boards while he\u2019s been on the floor. And the Grizzlies don\u2019t seem to have a team rule against guards crashing the glass when they see fit. Play 1. Morant misses a floater, but Valanciunas is able to bump Whiteside under the basket and tip the rebound back to Morant for a put-back. Number to know: The Grizzlies are tied with Boston for the league\u2019s second biggest jump in offensive rebounding percentage, from 24.7% ( 27th ) last season to 27.4% ( 13th ) this season. Play 2. This time, Morant, quick to his second jump like fellow rookie Zion Williamson, gets to his own offensive board before the two nearby Blazers. Number to know: The Grizzlies\u2019 three-guard lineup of Morant, Melton, Brooks, Anderson and Valanciunas has grabbed 55.1% of available rebounds, the fourth highest rate among 91 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes together. Play 3. A pick-and-roll with Josh Jackson gets Kent Bazemore switched onto Valanciunas. He\u2019s unable to take advantage on his initial catch on the block, but has an easy time with the offensive rebound when Jaren Jackson Jr. misses a long 3-pointer. Number to know: Valanciunas accounts for two of the four instances in which a player has recorded 14 or more second chance points in a game this season. Play 4. Valanciunas is too big and strong for Nemanja Bjelica under the basket and tips in another miss from the perimeter. Number to know: According to Synergy, Valanciunas has shot 63.0% on put-back field goal attempts, the seventh best mark among 26 players with at least 75 attempts. Play 5. With smaller Suns trying to keep Valanciunas off the glass as Brooks isolates against DeAndre Ayton, Morant crashes from the top of the key and times his leap perfectly. Number to know: 43% of the Grizzlies\u2019 minutes, the the highest rate among the 22 teams still playing, have come from rookies and second-year players. Despite their relentlessness in pushing in transition, attacking in the pick-and-roll, and crashing the glass, the Grizzlies rank 20th offensively . That\u2019s a big improvement from ranking 27th in offensive efficiency in each of the previous two seasons, but they\u2019ve still got a long way to go. There is a distinction between shots in the restricted area and shots elsewhere in the paint. Though the Grizzlies rank second in field goal percentage in the latter, the former are still worth a lot more. And while Memphis ranks first in the percentage of their shots that have come in the paint (56%), they rank just 14th in the percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted area (33%). But their offensive issues are mostly about the perimeter. The Grizzlies are one of four teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage (35.2%, 21st ) and the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (34.1%, 27th ). Their relative success in the paint has them ranking higher offensively than the other three teams \u2013 Golden State, New York and Orlando \u2013 in that group. But the Grizzlies\u2019 shooting issues give them a fairly low ceiling in regard to how good they can be on that end of the floor. The lack of shooting also limits the space that Morant has to operate and is one reason why some of those drives don\u2019t get all the way to the basket. Play 1. Morant goes baseline when Lillard ices a screen from Valanciunas, and he gets around Whiteside with some creative ball-handling. But he\u2019s met by four players on the other side of the paint, because neither Jackson nor Anderson is spacing the floor. Brooks is still open somehow, but he misses the catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. Number to know: The Grizzlies have just two of the 116 players (Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr.) who have shot the league average (37.0%) or better on at least 100 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts. Play 2. When McCollum stays under two screens for Morant, the rookie has nowhere to go. The Grizzlies remain stagnant and Morant misses a pull-up 3-pointer. Number to know: Morant has shot 34.9% on pull-up 3-pointers, better than the league average (33.0%) and the 33rd best mark among 80 players who have attempted at least 75. But his 1.5 pull-up 3-point attempts per game ranks just 75th in the league . Play 3. Brooks gains an advantage when he goes back door against Bazemore\u2019s top-locking defense. With four defenders in the paint, he kicks out to a wide-open Anderson in the right corner. But Anderson hesitates, the Kings are able to reset, and the advantage is lost. Bogdan Bogdanovic bails them out with a foul on Brooks\u2019 late-clock isolation. Number to know: The Grizzlies have the league\u2019s second lowest effective field goal percentage (39.4%) in the last six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Play 4. On a \u201cwedge\u201d action (Anderson sets a screen on Valanciunas\u2019 man as Valanciunas goes to set a screen on the ball), Morant gets into the paint. But LeBron James is there to meet him, because Anderson hasn\u2019t cleared all the way out to the opposite side (and\/or wouldn\u2019t be a threat if he did). Number to know: The Grizzlies have scored 9.7 fewer points per 100 possessions with Anderson on the floor (101.8) than they have with him off the floor (111.5). That\u2019s the worst on-off-court differential in regard to team points scored per 100 possessions among 218 players who have played at least 1,000 minutes for a single team. Play 5. When Kentavious Caldwell-Pope sinks to tag Valanciunas\u2019 roll to the rim, Anderson is open in the left corner and Morant makes the right read. It\u2019s just the wrong guy in that spot. Number to know: Anderson has shot 13-for-51 (25.5%) on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the 13th worst mark among 285 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 50. Play 6. On Valanciunas\u2019 initial post-up, Avery Bradley isn\u2019t punished for turning his back on Morant to double the ball. On the re-post, Danny Green is able to sink into the paint, because Melton is trying to set a screen for a guy (Clarke) who\u2019s made 21 3-pointers all season. Number to know: Valanciunas has averaged 3.2 post-up possessions per game, 11th most in the league , according to Synergy. The 0.98 points per possession he\u2019s scored on post-ups ranks sixth among 21 players who\u2019ve averaged at least 2.5 post-up possessions per game. There was hope that, when the season resumed, Justise Winslow would give the Grizzlies some better (or more willing) shooting, while providing the same defensive impact as Anderson. But Winslow suffered a hip injury on Monday and won\u2019t make his Memphis debut until next season. With their four full-time starters on the floor, the Grizzlies have scored an anemic 90.1 points per 100 possessions in 126 minutes with Anderson as the fifth guy and 115.4 per 100 in 425 minutes with someone else as the fifth guy. Alas, in 413 of those other 425 minutes , the fifth guy was a guy (Jae Crowder) who\u2019s no longer on the team. Crowder was traded at the deadline, Winslow never played after arriving in the trade, and Jaren Jackson Jr. suffered a knee injury in the second game after the All-Star break. So the restart is an opportunity for Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins to reinvent his rotation. He could still start Anderson (who would be needed to guard James if the Grizzlies make the playoffs as the 8 seed), but extend the minutes of his reserve guards (Jones and Melton have each averaged fewer than 20 minutes per game) to provide more pace and offense. He had already started playing Morant and Melton more together after the trade deadline. Josh Jackson, who averaged 16.6 points in five March games, remains a wildcard. No matter who\u2019s on the floor, the Grizzlies will need transition and second-chance opportunities to stay afloat offensively. For the season, 27.6% of the their points, the league\u2019s second highest rate, have been either fast break points (15.9%, third highest rate ) or second chance points (11.7%, 13th highest). As they move forward, the Grizzlies will need to add more shooting around Morant. The rookie will also have to become a more willing shooter himself, because now that the league has seen him for close to a full season, going under screens could be more of the default game plan. In 10 of the 12 plays shown above in which Morant got into the paint via a ball screen and scored himself or dished off to a teammate, his defender went over or iced the screen and trailed Morant into the paint. Morant\u2019s ability to get into the paint will continue to be the foundation for what the Grizzlies do offensively. Just 59 games into his career, it\u2019s already taken the Grizzlies further than anyone expected. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Westbrook arrived in Orlando on Monday after quarantining for two weeks. Once he arrived in Orlando, he quarantined in his hotel room until he cleared the NBA\u2019s protocol to enter the campus. Westbrook told the media on Wednesday he experienced no COVID-19 symptoms beyond a stuffy nose. He is unsure how long it will take him to return to game shape. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m just thankful and blessed to be able to go out and compete again,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cBut, just quarantining at home, trying to be productive, obviously not able to get on the basketball floor, but finding ways to kind of stay active and do as much conditioning I can probably do as far as that. \u201cThat\u2019s the last think I worry about, honestly. Before I had to quarantine, I was in pretty good shape so I should be all right.\u201d Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said Westbrook probably won\u2019t be available for Friday\u2019s scrimmage against the Toronto Raptors. Westbrook was expected to go through about 80% of Wednesday\u2019s practice. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait the next two practices, see where he is,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWhether he wants to be thrown out there real quick or wants another couple of days.

There\u2019s a walking path near the signs, which allows you to (a) enjoy the glistening of the calm water and (b) stray within lunging distance of a gator should the beast feel the urge to venture from the lake and feast. It\u2019s my preferred daily route to the testing site and cafeteria anyway, and when I brave that walk, the head stays on swivel. I haven\u2019t seen a copperhead or black Mamba (RIP, Kobe) or rattler slither into view from the tall weeds yet. And I\u2019ve already strained my neck multiple times searching the water on the lookout for a pair of eyes and a snout breaking the surface. Nothing. No gator, although I did spot the seven-foot version, Joakim Noah, formerly of Gainesville and the University of Florida, the other day. I suspect Jo is, ahem, chomping at the bit to finally suit up for the Clippers (I\u2019ll be here all week. All month, actually). When Walt Disney purchased gobs of swampland to build this entertainment Goliath back in the 1960s, he wanted to protect as much nature as possible. He was a developer but also an environmentalist; yes, the two can coexist. And so, the entire Walt Disney World property is less than half developed even now. He built his hotels and theme parks around the natural lakes to give wildlife a chance to roam. Quite often, there are gator and snake sightings. My daughter once competed annually in the AAU national track championships at the stadium just a few hundred yards from the NBA basketball venues at the ESPN Wide World Of Sports Complex, and there was a small lake just beyond the starting line. One year, a gator was sighted swimming in that lake. All the kids had no problem running the fastest times of their young and petrified lives that day. Actually, I\u2019m eager to see danger, from a distance, of course. The sight of some of Florida\u2019s natural creatures would be therapeutic and a sign of normalcy on an NBA campus that is anything but. This has become The Place That Coronavirus Created and we\u2019re here only for health reasons. At times, being inside this self-contained campus doesn\u2019t seem real, and it\u2019s only July; the NBA Finals might stretch to mid-October. So I\u2019m staying the course by staying on the path for the daily walk, head turning, eyes sharpened, always on alert for a sudden movement, always ready to jump higher and further than Derrick Jones Jr. did at the dunk contest last February. I suppose if I caught a rattler and carried it around, everyone would make sure they kept their social distance. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Taylor said in a statement he was recently approached by a third-party group to discuss the future of the franchise.

Yet there is some question about whether they\u2019re behind the wheel of a Porsche or a Pontiac. The eight-game seeding schedule in this NBA season reboot was created almost specifically to determine their fate and ability to put distance between them and those teams in hot pursuit. In the basketball vernacular, the Grizzlies must execute a quick and everlasting first step off the dribble and leave the others with shattered ankles and playoff dreams. Yet, let\u2019s repeat: Are the Grizzlies actually more vulnerable to become victims of a Pelicans or Blazers or Spurs takeover instead? It\u2019s really the only seeded-schedule drama with any pulse in Orlando. Yes, there can and will likely be a shuffling of the order in the standings of both conferences, but since home court is no longer an advantage \u2014 no fans, remember \u2014 doesn\u2019t that kill the vibe a bit? There is no significant difference between the first and second seed, or fourth and fifth. Meanwhile: With the eight playoff spots in the East virtually assured \u2014 Bradley Beal skipping the Wizards\u2019 Disney trip made that a wrap \u2014 the suspense swirls exclusively around Memphis. The Grizzlies are bringing the projected Rookie of the Year and a comfy 3 1\/2-game lead cushion as the No. 8 seed to the argument \u2026 and a precarious grip on the buttery pole as well. This has folks beyond Beale Street sensing one thing, and those inside the Grizzlies\u2019 foxhole thinking something altogether different. Jaren Jackson Jr., the boyish wonder of a power forward, brings a message to anyone who dares to raise doubt about Memphis. He mentioned a collective \u201cchip on our shoulder\u201d and added: \u201cWe know we can get even better.\u201d Taylor Jenkins, off to a quick start as a first-time coach, was pleasantly encouraged by the amount of spunk that accompanied the trip from Memphis. \u201cComing into this situation with the hiatus, I came hoping for the best and our guys have had an unbelievable ability to reconnect,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThese guys came here with an aggression. Hopefully that translates into the seeded games.\u201d And Ja Morant, whose unique name is currently being spell-checked by the engravers as they ready the trophy for the league\u2019s top rookie, gave the most compelling reason for folks to press pause on any ideas of a Memphis collapse: \u201cThis team goes as I go.\u201d The Grizzlies have reason to be a bit ornery and feel the sting of disrespect. They had a solid season before the coronavirus stoppage, hiked the entertainment level considerably in a home arena raised on a grit-n-grind history, and produced better than expected composure and results from a mostly youthful roster. After a 6-16 start, Memphis recovered and went 26-17 to put itself in position to avoid the draft lottery. Then the pandemic hit. Morant in particular has been an eyeful, issuing nightly challenges to opposing players with longer bodies and resumes and earning their respect. He is averaging 17.6 points, 6.9 assists, demands the ball in moments of truth and evidently ordered takeout from Rendezvous barbecue during the shutdown because he\u2019s almost 15 pounds more chiseled. Bluff City, meet Buff City. \u201cI took the time off to focus on my body,\u201d Morant said. That\u2019s all nice. Yet we\u2019d all be remiss to dismiss some rather meaningful factors that could see another team replace Memphis for that eighth spot or, in the event the Grizzlies don\u2019t finish at least four games ahead, force Memphis into a play-in game (or two) for that last spot. And that\u2019s before factoring in the season-ending hip injury suffered on Monday by veteran forward Justise Winslow, who has yet to play a game for Memphis since being acquired from Miami earlier in the season. The Grizzlies have the toughest seeded games by far. Almost every night they\u2019ll either see one of the teams they\u2019re trying to fend off or an established winner. Any prolonged slump could have fatal consequences. The Pelicans are peaking at the right time, or at least they were before the interruption. Also, they\u2019re America\u2019s Choice for that eighth spot because, well, Zion Williamson, assuming he returns in time from his leave of absence and actually plays. The NBA\u2019s TV partners, trying to recoup lost millions, are certainly all slobbery over the prospect of selling us Zion vs. LeBron in a tasty first-round matchup. The Blazers \u2014 remember them? \u2014 were in the conference finals just last summer and if you ask them, they believe they can make a return trip. Carmelo Anthony has been a mid-season revelation and now the Blazers welcome back Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins from the injury shelf. Oh, yes, there\u2019s also Damian Lillard, too. The Spurs qualify as a tougher sell without an injured LaMarcus Aldridge although they can play spoiler, and you bet against a Gregg Popovich-coached team at your own risk. They do have a 20-year playoff streak riding on this, you realize. Those three are the most likely candidates to spoil the mood in Memphis and yet the playoffs are the Grizzlies\u2019 to lose at this point. Morant and Jackson don\u2019t appear to be the type to allow their teammates to relax and take anything for granted, and this hasn\u2019t escaped the notice of Jenkins. \u201cSince day one I always talked about the leadership of our team and it doesn\u2019t matter where that comes from,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cBut to see two young guys taking the onus to be more vocal in practices and team meetings and on the sideline \u2026 these guys have been dialed in. And it\u2019s infectious. It\u2019s all about supporting one another.\u201d The Grizzlies are bringing Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks to the young mix; both have shown plenty of pop in spurts. Then there is Josh Jackson, once a No. 4 pick just three (very long) years ago who has triumphantly kicked off a personal Reputation Tour with this career-saving stop in Memphis. \u201cWe\u2019re all healthy and deep in the roster,\u201d Morant said. \u201cI feel that\u2019s a plus for us.\u201d The Grizzlies also believe the playoffs would quicken the maturity rate for this team and get the players to develop a thirst for winning and leaving the rebuilding process behind. What better way for youngsters to grow up rapidly than to feel the weight of LeBron and the Lakers in a seven-game series? You can\u2019t learn that by watching from home. But first, the Grizzlies are battling twin forces: The desperate teams trying to catch them and the notion that Memphis wouldn\u2019t be a sexy enough date for the Lakers and LeBron in the first round. If there are fans on Planet Basketball who\u2019d rather have Memphis over the other choices, the Grizzlies haven\u2019t heard them, or think they actually exist, and if so probably won\u2019t believe them anyway. Such is another log for the fire than burns within. The Grizzlies know full well they\u2019re the team with the target here in Orlando and how they must fight to earn the desire of a skeptical public. Therefore, it\u2019s Memphis vs. Everybody, so it seems. \u201cWe can\u2019t live or die by one game, no matter how it goes,\u201d Morant said. \u201cWe just need to continue to play our style of basketball.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The tribute patch will feature the number 1,223 in recognition of the total number of wins during Sloan\u2019s 23 seasons as head coach of the Jazz. It will be worn for the first time on July 23 as part of the NBA restart. During the 2020-21 season, Jazz jerseys will display a commemorative black strip with the same \u201c1223\u201d design. Additional details on how the franchise will honor Sloan next season will be announced later. Sloan passed away in May 2020 due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease and Lewy body dementia at the age of 78. \u201cCoach Jerry Sloan will forever be in the hearts of the Utah Jazz organization and fans everywhere, and we feel it is only fitting to honor him in this way,\u201d said Greg Miller, member of the NBA Board of Governors and Director of the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies. \u201cHis contributions to our Jazz family and communities are a defining part of our franchise history and we look forward to seeing 1,223 on the jerseys of our players in Orlando as a nod to his legacy.\u201d Fans can purchase a commemorative jersey patch for $12.23 with proceeds benefitting the Michael J. Fox Foundation, dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease. Patches can be purchased both in-store and online and can be affixed on a jersey. The Jazz have made a financial contribution in Sloan\u2019s memory to the Michael J. Fox Foundation and direct donations are also encouraged. A 2009 inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Sloan spent 23 seasons as the head coach of the Jazz (1988-2011), finishing his career with the third most wins in NBA history (1,221-803), sixth best winning percentage (.603) all-time (min. 500 wins), two NBA Finals appearances (1997 and 1998) and seven division titles. He also guided the Jazz to 16 consecutive winning seasons and thirteen 50-win seasons. Sloan\u2019s teams made 20 trips to the NBA Playoffs (19 with Utah: 1989-2003, \u201907-10) and his 98 playoff wins are the sixth most in NBA history. Sloan worked for the Jazz organization for 34 years as either head coach, assistant, scout or senior basketball adviser. He started as a scout (1983-84), became an assistant coach to Frank Layden on Nov. 19, 1984, and was named the sixth head coach in franchise history on December 9, 1988, when Layden resigned. Twenty-three seasons and 1,809 games later, Sloan finished his career as the Jazz\u2019s winningest coach based on both wins and winning percentage (1,127-682, .623). The longest tenured coach with one franchise in all of major professional sports at the time of his retirement, there were 245 NBA head coaching changes during his Jazz coaching career. Sloan coached 133 different players during his tenure as head coach of the Jazz. The Jazz have created a website hub that honors Sloan\u2019s remarkable career."},{"id":26945,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-day-9-honoring-bubble","date":"2020-07-21","title":"Disney World Diary: Honoring the 'bubble' comes with a personal price","content":" The NBA announced Monday that no players have tested positive for COVID-19 so far at Disney and that\u2019s the purest evidence yet as to how the self-contained campus is working. With all the daily testing and health charting and security in place, this snow-globe is hermetically sealed, a protected haven of hope inside the virus-mad state of Florida. This zero-positive is also the result of the deal everyone makes by being allowed inside: You follow the social distancing rules, get your test \u2014 I almost forgot to get swabbed Monday and reached the testing office with minutes to spare before closing \u2014 and do not even think about leaving and coming back. You step outside that front gate, you best keep walking. That sounds perfectly fine. But what happens when personal tragedy strikes a family member or loved one at home? What then? Zion Williamson , because he carries considerable value around here, was able to tend to an emergency but will be welcomed back and retested when he\u2019s ready. Meanwhile, yours truly, because I\u2019m merely an invited guest and cannot execute a 360-degree dunk, will not if such a need arises. Those of us who make that Disney deal must keep fingers crossed that we don\u2019t get an alarming phone call. Well, the phone buzzed yesterday. Best friend from high school died suddenly from heart failure. As you reach a certain age, these calls begin to increase along with the facial wrinkles. Lyndon Byrd and I ran on the track team together; his speed was certified, mine suspect. His dramatic come-from-behind anchor leg on the state champion sprint relay was made possible by my slow third leg. I\u2019m still numb from the news. I ache for his family while being annoyed at myself for procrastinating for years about paying a visit. And there\u2019s this: I made that deal with Disney and therefore can\u2019t fly to the funeral. As an empty chair will represent me at the memorial, friends scattered around the country, reunited by grief, will bond inside the old neighborhood and swap fond stories of the departed. They will marvel at the man\u2019s down-home demeanor, how he bailed on a good job to return to his family home to help his ailing parents, how he whipped a mouthy Eric Dickerson in a college 100-meter race, and how he never really changed in over four decades. The irony of this job is how it has whisked me to Scotland and Australia, South Africa and Tokyo, Rome and Paris, but can\u2019t get me to Pittsburgh to pay my last respects. This setup in Orlando, unprecedented in sports, is the only way the 2019-20 season could possibly continue and survive. It involves the cooperation of a small army of players, coaches, referees, testers, therapists, doctors, ball boys, health officials, TV technicians and security personnel to give us basketball at its purist and safest. The statistical proof says the coronavirus is having a hard time infiltrating the campus. So far, the NBA is winning big. A destructive virus can\u2019t get in.

Related:  Jumpman logo will appear on NBA Statement Edition uniforms for 2020-21 season \u201cNow more than ever, it\u2019s important for Atlantans to come together. We know sports has the power to unify and for years, true Hawks fans have shared their passion for our classic colorways. With the guidance of our ownership team and the talents of our brand creative and merchandising teams led by Shirley Zhang and Amy Serino working alongside our Nike design partners, we have found a sweet spot of classic and modern for the future of the franchise. This new look will stand the test of time and exemplifies our brand mantra, forever True to Atlanta,\u201d said Melissa Proctor, Atlanta Hawks & State Farm Arena Chief Marketing Officer. Each color symbolizes integral components of the Hawks franchise and its commitment to the state of Georgia and city of Atlanta: TORCH RED: Red is a consistent thread throughout Atlanta Hawks teams from our beginning in 1968. This primary color symbolizes the heart of our unending quest for excellence, our red-hot spirit and fiery passion for the game. INFINITY BLACK: Affirms the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 bold and relentless pursuit of a championship, fueled by the support of our unwavering fans and a love for our city that will never die.

Designed with Nike, the NBA\u2019s official uniform and apparel provider, the retro colorway will take shape on Nike\u2019s three signature uniform styles: The Association, Icon and Statement editions. The Statement edition pops with an Infinity Black base and Hawks stitched across the chest in Legacy Yellow with a Torch Red outline. Legacy Yellow fills the letters, numbers and marks with a subtle Torch Red outline. Torch Red and Legacy Yellow alternate along the sides of the jersey and shorts, intersecting with the Evo primary icon logo on both sides of the shorts. The waistband sports the new \u2018A-T-L\u2019 secondary logo. The Sharecare jersey patch is placed just above the heart on all three versions of the new Hawks uniform. Jordan Brand\u2019s Jumpman logo, located at the right jersey strap is a daring addition to the kit symbolizing the legend\u2019s approach to the game and will appear on all NBA Statement Edition uniforms beginning with the 2020-21 season. Both the Association and Icon editions have Atlanta emblazoned across the chest with the Swoosh logo below the strap on the right side and directly across from the Sharecare patch. White makes up the primary color of the Association uniform with Torch Red filling the numbers, letters and marks and Legacy Yellow borders. Along the sides, red and yellow stripes alternate and run the length of the jersey. Torch Red is the primary color of the Icon edition with white filling the numbers, letters and marks with Legacy Yellow borders and alternating stripes on the sides. The shorts of both uniforms feature the iconic Evo logo on both legs with the club\u2019s new secondary \u2018Hawks\u2019 wordmark appearing at the mid-section of the waistband. With the new uniforms, the Hawks join the College Park Skyhawks, the official NBA G League affiliate of the Hawks, and Hawks Talon Gaming Club, official NBA 2K League affiliate of the Hawks, in completing the brand\u2019s visual unification featuring the classic colorways. Since 2017, the Atlanta Hawks have held a multiyear partnership with Sharecare, the Atlanta-based digital health company that helps people manage all their health in one place.

(AP) \u2014 LeBron James keeps hearing the same questions. How\u2019s it going? How\u2019s the bubble? He now has a one-size-fits-all answer. \u201cI just say it\u2019s 2020,\u201d James said. \u201cNothing is normal in 2020.\u201d That\u2019s not entirely true. The NBA is a few weeks from playoff mode, and James \u2014 just like normal \u2014 has himself and the Los Angeles Lakers squarely in the mix to compete for championship. It is a rare bit of normalcy for a player who appeared in eight consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 through and including 2018, and for a franchise that has won 16 championships. Everything else about this year has been most abnormal. A pandemic suspended play. David Stern, the NBA\u2019s commissioner emeritus, died. Kobe Bryant, who was the third-leading scorer in NBA history until James passed him on Jan. 25, died in a helicopter crash the following day. And now James, the Lakers and 21 other teams are at Walt Disney World, separated from the rest of the world, trying to salvage a season and decide a champion. James took Bryant\u2019s death \u2014 the Lakers\u2019 star died along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others on the morning of Jan. 26 \u2014 particularly hard. \u201cA day doesn\u2019t go by when I don\u2019t think about him,\u201d James said. \u201cA day doesn\u2019t go by where our organization does not remember him and think about not only Kob, but Gigi, (his wife) Vanessa and their girls. They are a part of this family.\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel has seen playoff-season James three times before, never liking how those experiences went. Vogel was coaching Indiana and his three best seasons there saw the Pacers matched up with James and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Heat in 6 in 2012. Heat in 7 in 2013. Heat in 6 in 2014. This time, Vogel is genuinely and understandably eager to see James at playoff time. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s been great having LeBron on our side after years of going against him,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cBut in particular, when we get to the playoff environment, I\u2019ve just seen how he is this year in some of the bigger regular season games, how he\u2019s more mentally locked in, more vocal, more making sure everybody else is locked in. And I anticipate that come playoff time, we\u2019ll see that all being done at an enhanced level.\u201d James will have a big say in whether the Lakers win that title. By the time the season resumes July 30, the ballots will be cast to determine whether he or Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 the two frontrunners \u2014 wins the NBA MVP award. James is mathematically assured of winning his first assist title; he cannot be caught by second-place Trae Young of Atlanta no matter what happens at Disney. And the Lakers, barring all-out collapse, will be the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. By any measure, it\u2019s been a good year on the court for James. A weird year, but a good year. Time will tell if it\u2019s a great year. He believes the bubble will work and sees no reason yet why this NBA experiment would fail. And while he detests being away from his family and his inner circle, he\u2019s using this chance to be locked in to focus on the opportunity. \u201cAs far as the MVP race, I think I\u2019ve shown what I\u2019m capable of doing, not only individually but from a team\u2019s perspective, us being No. 1 in the West,\u201d James said. \u201cThere was a lot of conversation about, you know, \u2018LeBron can do those things in the East but if he ever came to the West, what can he do?\u2019 \u201cI heard all of that, and to have our team at the top of the Western Conference and playing the way that we were playing at that time and the way I was playing, you know, that\u2019s definitely a good feeling.\u201d"},{"id":26985,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-teamrosters-season-restart-orlando","date":"2020-07-20","title":"NBA announces team rosters for season restart","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 The NBA announced today the restart rosters for the 22 teams participating in the resumption of the 2019-20 season at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.

Books for teachers, spreadsheets for accountants, scripts for actors, microphones for singers. Those can\u2019t-do-without tools. For us reporters, it\u2019s the interview, that chat session with the subject where we learn a bit and ultimately relay the goods to the reader. Before the 1950s, sportswriters rarely spoke to athletes. By the 1970s, when the popularity of sports mushroomed and the demand to know our heroes expanded as well, the interview became a necessity. The art of crafting the right question was the oxygen for stories and reporting. The leagues cooperated because it was good for business and helped teams and players build their brands and connect with an audience. Not all interviews went smoothly, then and even now. Over the years I\u2019ve seen Barry Bonds scream at reporters, Bill Laimbeer insult them, Rasheed Wallace heckle them, Kawhi Leonard do everything possible to avoid them. Those were the exceptions; for the most part, interviews enjoy the spirit of mutual cooperation. Here at the NBA reboot the interview is something altogether different. Interviews are largely done by Zoom, a reflection of the technology of today, but also the health crisis we\u2019re in today. Here\u2019s how it works: A player or two, along with the coach, will sit in a chair facing a large flat-screen monitor. Then he\u2019ll answer questions from reporters virally in other cities. Even the few reporters allowed here at the Disney campus, including yours truly, must connect by logging onto Zoom and speaking questions into our cell phones to a player sitting a few arms lengths away. On those rare occasions when an interview can take place after practice without Zoom, the reporter and player must stand six feet apart \u2014 keep those masks on! \u2014 and the interview is on the clock and ticking fast. It\u2019s a cold and impersonal new world for journalism until science gives us a better option. Even though I had a heads-up, it was still a shock Monday when players and coaches who once allowed for casual conversation just last spring were suddenly unapproachable. Four months ago, before the pandemic changed everything, reporters would crowd LeBron James five-deep in the cramped Lakers locker room. Until further notice, LeBron will now enjoy plenty of space. It reminds me of old footage of NBA teams immediately after clinching a title in their home arena. I can still picture Larry Bird racing through the mob of fans who swarmed the parquet floor, tearing at his jersey. Security soon put an end to that dangerous ritual. The intimacy we reporters enjoyed before March 11 would now be classified as dangerous, too. The NBA is taking no chances, nor should the league; too much is at stake, mainly the health of everyone. So on Monday I didn\u2019t as much interview Lakers coach Frank Vogel, or Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, or Grizzlies rookie Ja Morant. In order to fit these uncomfortable times, the interview has now adopted whole a new description.

My seven-day, in-room quarantine at the NBA campus was over. I could step outside my hotel room and walk into the sunlight, and those first few steps were wobbly, uncertain, disoriented, newborn calf-like. Would I fall? What did it feel like to run? If you\u2019ve ever been shoehorned for a week inside a 12-foot-by-18-foot space, those are the initial thoughts swirling about. Never before has a human felt this anxious to feel the sticky warmth of Orlando humidity. In hindsight, confinement wasn\u2019t terribly inconvenient. The social isolation proved the biggest challenge; the only humans I interacted with arrived daily to give the mandated coronavirus test and that lasted 60 seconds. Technology helped pass the time; the internet and video and the like allows for a certain sense of comfort and connectivity. There were also stories that needed to be written for the website, of course. Had this happened in the tech stone age of 25 years ago, the only device would be books. The other issue that\u2019s thankfully in the rear view is the food. Three meals were delivered daily at 8, noon and 6. The quality varied, but that wasn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s almost impossible to please everyone with the options so they sent multiple choices, and every meal left me with more regrets than calories.  It became a wasteful exercise. All the iced coffee, sodas, egg biscuits, carrots, celery, sausages and milk never left their packaging. I don\u2019t eat them, didn\u2019t want them. And because of all the health precautions here at the Disney reboot, you couldn\u2019t return them. I immediately thought of the handful of trips I took through the Skid Row neighborhood over the last few years, the epicenter of the homelessness in L.A., and what that food would\u2019ve meant to the less fortunate. Now that I\u2019m out of quarantine, I can choose my food, and I\u2019m promising that everything will be eaten. The plate will be cleaner than LeBron\u2019s block on Iguodala. Once freedom rings at Disney, what\u2019s the first stop? Well, that\u2019s easy. The health club at the Coronado Springs Resort is rather on the small side and yet, for someone who hasn\u2019t broken a sweat in a week, it was the size of Staples Center. The treadmill and weights were more punishing than normal and never felt so good.  There is a running trail that can and perhaps will be used at another time. Not that this hotel complex is hurting for space to stretch out and expand and roam. The vast parking lot, which would normally be full of rental cars this time of year, is virtually empty. The NBA rented out the resort for staff and media. No tourists. This is now a business hotel. And business begins tomorrow for me with practices to attend and interviews to conduct. Fresh out of one-week isolation, it will be refreshing and normal to once again be around a group of people, although here in this new uncertain world, even that will be different for sports reporters. I can almost hear the hard and stern instructions now: \u201cPlease remain six feet from LeBron James at all times, thank you.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The All-Star point guard turned part of his suite into a mini recording studio at Disney\u2019s Wide World of Sports Complex, where his team will make a push for a playoff berth. The league constructed a social bubble to resume the NBA season and protect 22 teams from COVID-19 while at the resort, which features several activities such as walking trails, a bowling alley and a lake to fish or boat. But under his rap persona Dame D.O.L.L.A., Lillard expects to turn his attention to laying down tracks when he is not occupied with basketball. He\u2019s striving to make his rap persona just as known as his pro basketball identity, like the Emmy-winning actor Donald Glover who won multiple Grammys under his alter ego, Childish Gambino. \u201cThat\u2019s the point I want to get to,\u201d he said. \u201cI admire him with how he\u2019s established himself into two different lanes. People respect him in each lane. That\u2019s my goal.\u201d Lillard\u2019s room is equipped with a microphone perched on a stand, headphones, laptop with recording software and audio interface to control everything. He said the thick carpet in his room should help the sound quality. He said the setup is \u201csimple,\u201d but it\u2019s good enough for him to create music in a room where he can isolate himself. \u201cI saw people saying that there would be complaints of him recording music, but I don\u2019t have any speakers. Everything is in the headphone speakers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m rapping out loud, but not screaming to the top of my lungs. Nobody is going to hear me rapping.\u201d Lillard has earned respect in the hip-hop world as a socially conscious lyricist as Dame D.O.L.L.A., which stands for Different On Levels the Lord Allows. He\u2019s recorded songs with some of the biggest names in the music industry including Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz and Jamie Foxx. He also performed with Wayne during NBA All-Star weekend earlier this year. Last month, Lillard released \u201cGoat Spirit\u201d featuring Raphael Saadiq and the powerful \u201cBlacklist,\u201d a song addressing police brutality of unarmed Black people. It\u2019s a song he felt compelled to put out after the killing of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. Once the NBA season restarts, Lillard will have the words \u201cHow Many More?\u201d stitched on his jersey. He said he does not consider himself an activist, but he wants to express his feelings on the good and negative matters impacting his community. That\u2019s what also led Lillard to release his new song and music video \u201cHome Team\u201d on Friday. The song pays homage to his family and closest friends that he financially helped start their entrepreneurial journey. \u201cThey do all these things and those are the things that I\u2019m investing in to make my people deeper and stronger,\u201d said Lillard of his friends who have become a businessman, chef, handyman and even a farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s not an entourage of people that hangout with me, because I\u2019m an NBA player.

(AP) \u2014 The first exhibition games of the NBA restart will go a little more quickly than usual. The NBA is tweaking the rules for those initial matchups, going with 10-minute quarters instead of the usual 12 minutes. The change is for several reasons \u2014 among them, not wanting to overly tax players after they went more than four months without games, and because some teams do not have their full rosters at Walt Disney World yet because of coronavirus and other issues. The change will apply only to the first exhibition for teams; their second and third exhibition games at Disney will use standard timing. All teams are slated to play three exhibitions. \u201cThis is a different situation,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said Saturday. \u201cIn all areas, really. \u2026 I do think that there\u2019s some latitude to do some different things.\u201d Exhibitions start with a four-game slate Wednesday and continue through July 28. Plans call for all 33 exhibitions to be televised by some combination of local TV, national TV, NBA TV or NBA League Pass. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s done just trying to get safety first for the players,\u201d Orlando coach Steve Clifford said of the shorter first exhibition. \u201cI think most teams are like us, where everybody is just feeling their way and guys aren\u2019t in the type of condition they would normally be in in a training camp situation.\u201d The league is still working on some of the specifics for the first games, even whether to give teams the option of wearing uniforms or practice gear. Most teams, as of Saturday, were still planning to wear their usual regular-season uniforms for all three of their exhibitions \u2014 the new jerseys featuring social justice messaging will not debut until the seeding games that count begin July 30. Other changes for the exhibition games may include using more than three referees in a rotating system, though that also remains under discussion. Players apparently had not been told the first exhibitions will go faster. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that yet,\u201d said Oklahoma City guard Chris Paul, the president of the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll find out.\u201d The exhibitions will be played like normal games \u2014 score and stats will be kept, and it will be a chance for the league\u2019s stat crews that were hired to work for three months at Disney to work out any kinks in the system. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said he\u2019s taking a different view than he does for typical preseason matchups. For the first time, he\u2019s talking with the coaches of the teams the Heat will face \u2014 Sacramento\u2019s Luke Walton and Utah\u2019s Quin Snyder \u2014 to see if there are any specific situations those clubs want to work on in those games. Spoelstra simply bumped into Snyder in the lobby of a Disney hotel and from there, the idea of one team helping out another in the exhibitions was born. The Heat and Jazz will not play in a seeding game and couldn\u2019t meet in a game that counts at Disney until the NBA Finals. \u201cYou have to fast-track so much before you get to that eight-game regular season. \u2026 We\u2019ll approach it that way and play probably everybody available, but definitely work on some things and do a little bit of evaluating as well,\u201d Spoelstra said. The exhibitions will be helpful in breaking up the monotony of practice, Denver coach Michael Malone said, but he stressed that player health will come before anything else in those games. \u201cThe No. 1 thing for me is can we get through these three scrimmages healthy and not getting guys put in a position where they\u2019re overworked, playing too many minutes and getting hurt,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI think the vast majority of the 22 teams will approach it the same way.\u201d"},{"id":26950,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-teams-mourn-death-civil-rights-icon-john-lewis","date":"2020-07-18","title":"NBA family mourns death of civil rights icon John Lewis","content":" John Lewis, a fearless civil rights leader and longtime US congressman, died on Friday after a battle with cancer. He was 80. \u201cThe NBA Family mourns the passing of Rep. John Lewis, a great American hero and icon of the civil rights movement and the fight for equality who helped galvanize opposition to racial segregation and social injustice,\u201d the league said . From organizing protests during the Civil Rights Movement to introducing bills in Congress, Lewis spent his life fighting against racism and injustice. He often encouraged people to \u201cspeak up and speak out\u201d and get into \u201cgood trouble\u201d as a way to move closer towards freedom. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders and a chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). On a day known as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d Lewis and hundreds of marchers were brutally attacked on the Edmund Pettus Bridge while protesting for the right of black people to register and vote. In Congress, Lewis introduced a bill that called for a massive black history museum in Washington, D.C. After years of perseverance, the National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in 2016. Lewis was a giant in the city of Atlanta, along with civil rights leader and author C.T. Vivian, who also passed away Friday. In a statement, the Atlanta Hawks called Vivian \u201ca distinguished icon whose leadership pushed the United States to greater justice and racial equality for African Americans\u201d and that Lewis \u201cwill forever be remembered throughout the city\u2019s peaceful protests to fight racial inequality in the 1960s.\u201d One of Lewis\u2019 most famous quotes: \u201cYou cannot be afraid to speak up and speak out for what you believe. You have to have courage, raw courage.\u201d NBA players and teams have followed those words by speaking up amid a Black Lives Matter movement that reached an increase in volume this year. Those around the league paid their respect and recognized Lewis as one of the pillars in the fight for justice.

Commissioner Adam Silver said it weeks ago: \u201cSafer on this campus than off this campus\u201d ; Clippers coach Doc Rivers said it before he even left Los Angeles: \u201cI don\u2019t know where else you would be as safe\u201d ; and Gregg Popovich of the Spurs, a 71-year-old considered by age to be at greater risk of being hit hard by COVID-19, said it upon arrival: \u201cIf this bubble works, I\u2019m safer here than I would be in Texas.\u201d All of which is good for the league\u2019s current players and coaches. They truly might be more protected amidst so much testing and the heightened protocols. But what of the NBA\u2019s retired players and coaches, who are scattered throughout the country, fending for themselves, sheltering individually, and coping with a higher susceptibility to the virus? \u201cRight now we have just a handful of members who have been diagnosed [positive],\u201d said Scott Rochelle, president and CEO of the National Basketball Retired Players Association. \u201cAll have survived and beaten this thing. We have one member who lost his wife to the virus.\u201d Johnny Davis, the former NBA guard who took over in February as the NBRPA chairman, broke down some of the statistics as they relate to their membership and COVID-19. \u201cWe have over 1,000 members, and the average age of our members is 55-plus,\u201d Davis said. \u201cApproximately 200 of those members are over the age of 70. And there\u2019s a high percentage of African-Americans in that group, the demographic that has been identified as being most vulnerable. Sometimes that\u2019s due to underlying conditions, sometimes to proximity to [exposure].\u201d The extended NBA family has been hit by the virus. Former point guard Sebastian Telfair reportedly lost a brother, Dan Turner, in late March and saw his mother Erica die from COVID-19 in New York a month later. Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns\u2019 mother Jacqueline died in April from complications from coronavirus. Those family members were in the age range of so many former NBA players. The \u201cLegends\u201d association, as it\u2019s known, tried to be pro-active from the start of the league\u2019s shutdown, reminding members to take all possible precautions. Each received an \u201cNBA Legends\u201d mask. \u201cMost of the players have been in touch with us,\u201d Rochelle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to keep in contact with people. And those who have been financially impacted, we\u2019ve been supporting them through our financial grant program. \u201cSo there\u2019s been a lot of work on the community side to make sure everyone is informed and knows where to come when they need help.\u201d The health insurance that the NBRPA got for its members out of the current collective bargaining agreement between the National Basketball Players Association and the owners has been a game-changer for many league retirees, Rochelle said. There is a mental health component to that coverage, too, providing psychologists to help those coping with the stress of the pandemic. \u201cPeople are self-quarantining,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou\u2019re not able to go out to restaurants and do things you normally do. For some people, that\u2019s stressful. You become isolated.\u201d Hall of Famer Rick Barry, formerly a member of the group\u2019s Board of Directors, had his routine changed when the Big 3 \u2013 the summer basketball league in which he coaches \u2013 announced it was suspending play until 2021. \u201cI\u2019m just going about my life, which has changed drastically,\u201d Barry said. \u201cUsually I\u2019m flying around to coach and see some of my old adversaries and some people I\u2019ve watched over the years. That\u2019s all been taken away. Every charity event I was doing, those have been cancelled. The basketball Hall of Fame [induction in August], that\u2019s been postponed . \u201cI feel most sorry for some young kids who have missed out on high school and college graduations. If I have a cruise cancelled, I can go on a cruise another time. But how do you make up for a graduation?\u201d Danny Schayes, the son of Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes and an NBA center from 1981-99, believes he was ahead of the virus curve based on falling ill last winter. \u201cI actually think I had it back in January and February when I was in Denver,\u201d Schayes said Friday. \u201cI went to Las Vegas to a home builders\u2019 show in January, and after that I had a month-long cough. I had fever spikes. I had pneumonia. Ended up being hospitalized for a couple of days. \u201cI asked the doctor treating me about this \u2018corona\u2019 thing, and he said, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no cases yet in Colorado.\u2019 But they weren\u2019t really testing anyone yet so how would they know? He said, \u2018What\u2019s weird is everyone I\u2019m seeing now has these exact symptoms.\u2019 \u201cSo I have not yet been tested for the antibodies. I\u2019m following the protocols like everybody, wearing a mask when I go out and the rest.\u201d Currently in Phoenix, Schayes said the sports talk show he co-hosts on his alma mater, Syracuse University, has been on hiatus since the NCAA basketball tournament shut down in March. His son Logan, a 6-foot-7 forward heading into his senior year in high school, also is facing uncertainty for the coming school year. Spencer Haywood, formerly the NBRPA chairman, acknowledged that it\u2019s hard to know how many former players have been affected. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re getting accurate reporting,\u201d said Haywood, another Hall of Famer. \u201cBecause people who have it might not know, and others who know might not want to talk about it. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s in Florida. It\u2019s Houston very strongly and that\u2019s one of our largest communities of past players. I\u2019ve been calling people, telling \u2018em certain things to do and take some precautions. We have a list \u2013 I don\u2019t go through the whole list, but I just talk to some of the guys who I know.\u201d Living in Las Vegas, Haywood \u2013 the subject of a book, \u201cThe Spencer Haywood Rule\u201d to be released in October \u2013 works the phone randomly to keep NBRPA members feeling connected. For example, he spoke Tuesday with Hall of Famer Earl Monroe, who has had some health challenges, and reported that Monroe was \u201changing in there.\u201d Keeping tabs on what the NBA is doing in Orlando \u2013 current players are, after all, future retirees \u2013 Haywood sounded impressed. \u201cThey\u2019ve got testing, they\u2019ve got everything in there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was a player now, I would be in there. I don\u2019t call it the \u2018bubble.\u2019 I call it the \u2018safe zone.\u2019\u201d The NBRPA hopes its bubble holds, too, one member at a time.

(AP) \u2014 The NBA\u2019s Kia MVP race is over. So is the battle for every other individual regular-season trophy. The league told teams Friday that none of the seeding games will be taken into consideration for any postseason award, and that voting for those honors \u2014 such as All-NBA , Kia Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 will be completed before the July 30 restart of the season at Walt Disney World. Typically, those votes are cast closer to the end of the regular season. So the postseason races are still going in many cases, but the individual award chases are now complete. \u201cThe decision to exclude seeding games from awards voting ensures a fair process in which players and coaches from all 30 teams will have the same opportunity to be honored as top performers for the regular season,\u201d the NBA wrote in a memo sent to teams Friday. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo. Only 22 of the league\u2019s 30 teams are participating in the NBA restart.  The league\u2019s decision \u2014 it was not unexpected \u2014 means that Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s campaign for back-to-back MVP awards technically ended more than four months ago when the season was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Antetokounmpo won his first MVP award after averaging 27.7 points and 12.5 rebounds per game last season. This season, he\u2019s expected to be an MVP frontrunner again with averages of 29.6 points and 13.7 rebounds for the Bucks \u2014 who have the league\u2019s best record. The NBA\u2019s decision also means that New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson, who has appeared in only 19 games this season, won\u2019t get to make a late push to try and catch presumed top-rookie frontrunner Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies. It\u2019s unclear if Williamson will even be with the Pelicans for re-opening night on July 30 when they face the Utah Jazz in the first game at the Disney campus. He left the NBA\u2019s so-called \u2018bubble\u2019 Thursday to deal with what the team called \u201can urgent family medical matter,\u201d and the Pelicans said he intends to return at an unspecified date. Statistical championships, such as the scoring, rebounding, assist and steal titles, are technically up for grabs through the end of the seeding games in mid-August. The league announced that portion of the plan when the schedules for the eight seeding games were released last month. Most of those stat-trophy races are all-but mathematically decided. Houston\u2019s James Harden has a commanding lead in the scoring race as he closes in on his third consecutive title in that category \u2014 and becomes the seventh player in NBA history to win the scoring crown in at least three straight seasons. Cleveland\u2019s Andre Drummond has a sizable lead in the race for the rebound title . LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers would remain ahead of second-place Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks in the assist-per-game race even if James plays in all eight seeding games and doesn\u2019t register a single assist. If the 35-year-old James wins the assist title, and it would take a mathematical oddity to keep that from happening, he will be the second-oldest player to claim that award. Steve Nash was 37 when he won his last assists crown. And James is also in line to be, by far, the oldest player in NBA history to finish a season averaging at least 25 points and 10 assists. That\u2019s happened only nine other times in the NBA, the last to do so being Russell Westbrook when he was 29 in 2017-18. The steals race is still uncertain; Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons leads at 2.13 per game, while Chicago\u2019s Kris Dunn \u2014 currently in second place \u2014 finished his season at 1.98 per game."},{"id":26990,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-montrezl-harrell-leaves-orlando-campus-urgent-family-situation","date":"2020-07-17","title":"Report: Montrezl Harrell leaves Orlando campus for 'urgent family situation'","content":" LA Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell has left the Orlando campus indefinitely to deal with an undisclosed family matter, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Thursday.

In response to COVID-19, the site will follow all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local public health department recommendations, including protocols for disinfecting shared spaces, signage for required social distancing standards and traffic flow, posted reminders about proper hand hygiene, and appropriate PPE requirements, such as cloth face coverings, for all election officials. \u201cWe are incredibly excited to work in partnership with the Sacramento Kings and the Golden 1 Center to host a Vote Center for the November election,\u201d said Sacramento County Registrar of Voters Courtney Bailey. \u201cAccess to a large, state of the art facility such as Golden 1 Center helps us ensure accessibility and proper social distancing, while also providing our residents the voting services they need. We\u2019re grateful to the Sacramento Kings for reaching out to us to help facilitate this partnership.\u201d In addition to its partnership with the County, the Kings are working with the California Secretary of State\u2019s office to amplify poll worker recruitment and education efforts, increase awareness around voting timelines and requirements, and host a virtual voter registration workshop for employees. \u201cAs elections officials work to educate the public on elections changes and to identify new voting locations and poll workers, we need partners like the Sacramento Kings\u201d Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. \u201cHaving trusted community partners like the Kings amplify and facilitate civic participation is invaluable as we confront the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. This partnership shows that Sacramento Proud extends beyond the basketball court. The Kings\u2019 leadership helps build a more inclusive democracy\u2014this is a slam dunk for the Sacramento region and beyond.\u201d The Kings have a history of encouraging active civic engagement and recently committed to providing employees a paid day off for election days. In 2018, the Kings launched and led Rally the Vote , a group of nine sports franchises across the NBA, NFL and MLB in a coordinated nonpartisan effort to encourage fans to register to vote. The effort reached millions of people by leveraging team social media platforms and registered thousands of voters in the month leading up to the 2018 midterm elections. Soon, the team plans to relaunch a nonpartisan coalition of professional sports teams working together to improve voter registration and turnout in November in partnership with national nonprofits focused on raising public awareness around voter participation and using sports as a lens to promote the importance of voting."},{"id":27019,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-day-3","date":"2020-07-17","title":"Disney World Diary: Zion WIlliamson's exit a weighty issue for Pelicans, NBA","content":" ORLANDO \u2014 The obvious and compassionate reaction is to respect the man\u2019s privacy. Zion Williamson left the NBA campus Thursday to tend to a family matter. If nothing else in this troubled 2020, we\u2019ve learned that some things are bigger than basketball. File \u201cloved ones\u201d in that category. Nobody will and should fault him for handling his business. There\u2019s also something else that\u2019s rather obvious: The whole idea of creating a seeded schedule and a play-in format for this NBA restart was done partly if not mostly with Williamson in mind. In terms of attention and intrigue, LeBron James will own it once the playoffs begin. Until then, all eyes will be fixated on the rookie. Zion is already on first-name basis with the basketball world despite us having only fleeting images of him; blame his early-season injury and the pandemic for that. And while his 19-game NBA career is only sample-sized so far, he\u2019s been a handful, scoring 20 or more points in 16 of those games. The forceful dunks, energy and impact from Zion became the tease that left us thirsty for more when the season went on hiatus in mid-March. He is made-for-TV theater and the franchise savior that New Orleans prayed for and received. Your next questions \u2014 when will he return, will he miss games and if so how many \u2014 are unanswered for now. He\u2019ll need to quarantine for four days if he\u2019s gone less than a week to keep with NBA campus protocol. If he is gone longer than a week, he will still quarantine for four days if he has a negative test for the final seven days he is gone. If he doesn\u2019t have the required testing, he will quarantine for 10 days. B ut, first things first. This much, we do know: There\u2019s a heavy suspicion that the basketball world would rather have Zion playing in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs instead of the Memphis Grizzlies, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, San Antonio Spurs or Phoenix Suns. In a sport and league that bled billions this season, Williamson is wide enough, quite literally, to help patch the wound. Should the Pelicans replace the Grizzlies, the current No. 8 seed , then it\u2019s Zion against LeBron \u2014 and the TV networks will barely be able to hide their enthusiasm. It just demonstrates how this league is based and built on star power, more than any other sport. And, when stars are absent, everything suffers. One star can make all the difference in the ratings and standings, and Williamson falls into that category. His importance is magnified in this restart as the NBA\u2019s network partners are starved for content after a summer of reruns. They\u2019re begging for storylines and drama to recoup lost millions. It\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that Zion and star players like him will save jobs. Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry and his team are keeping it all in perspective. But if you fed them some truth serum, they\u2019d admit that Zion is the difference between the team staying at Disney for at least an extra few weeks once the games begin or going home. \u201cWe also had a stretch where we won 12 out of 16 without him,\u201d Gentry said Thursday . \u201cObviously, he\u2019s a great player that we\u2019ll miss, but the one thing that we\u2019ve always talked about, even when we went through the tough times, is that \u2018 next man up \u2019 . We\u2019re a good team. We\u2019re a deep team. That\u2019s the one thing that we are, we\u2019re a very deep team, so we\u2019ll have guys that\u2019ll step in and play, and we\u2019ll have guys that will have upped their game a little bit more, but obviously, right now, we\u2019re not concerned about the basketball part for him. We\u2019re concerned about his family.\u201d While the rest of us are either stuck in our rooms serving out quarantine periods or trapped on the Disney campus, everyone has taken notice of one who just left. Until he returns, Zion will be missed even though he was hardly here. Pretty much like his rookie season to this point. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry addressed the media after Thursday\u2019s practice, but couldn\u2019t nail down a firm timetable for Williamson\u2019s possible return. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything right now from the standpoint of him coming back,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cObviously, for us, we\u2019re just very supportive of him and his family, and his privacy during this time right now.\u201d In early July, as teams readied to arrive at the NBA campus in Orlando, Williamson told The Associated Press he and New Orleans were gearing up for a playoff push. That appeared highly unlikely when he was sitting on the sidelines with a surgically repaired knee, watching New Orleans labor through a franchise-worst 13-game losing streak that left the club with a record of 6-22. \u201cI think this team can be really special when we\u2019re all healthy,\u201d Williamson said. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Williamson was expected to be out 6-to-8 weeks when he had surgery after tearing his right lateral meniscus the day before the regular season opened. He wound up missing about three months and 44 games. When he finally returned on Jan. 22, fans packed the stands and Williamson routinely delighted them with around-the-rim highlights. \u201cAs far as the impact on our team, we played 44 games without him,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe had a tough stretch in there. We also had a stretch where we won 12 out of 16 without him. Obviously, he\u2019s a great player that we\u2019ll miss. But the one thing we always talked about, even when we went through the tough times, is, \u2018Next man up.\u2019 We\u2019re a good team. We\u2019re a deep team. That\u2019s the one thing that we are. We\u2019re a very deep team. So, we\u2019ll have guys that will step in and play. We\u2019ll have guys that\u2019ll up their game a little bit more.\u201d Williamson averaged 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds in the 19 games he played. New Orleans won 10 of those games and looked to be gaining momentum when the season was suspended March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Still, that stint kept the Pelicans close enough to the playoff picture \u2013 3 1\/2 games behind Memphis for the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference \u2014 to be included among 22 NBA teams that will finish their regular seasons at a central location in Orlando, starting July 30, when New Orleans plays the Utah Jazz. It\u2019s been 18 years since an NBA team began a regular season at 7-23 through 30 games and still made the NBA playoffs. It\u2019s been 35 years since a club withstood a losing streak of 13 games and reached the postseason. \u201cWith [Zion] gone taking care of his family, we\u2019re holding down the fort for him,\u201d said point guard Jrue Holiday. \u201cHe\u2019s our brother, and he needs to take care of his family, and take care of his business.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":27011,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleared-play-james-harden-practices-rockets","date":"2020-07-17","title":"James Harden 'in good place' after first practice in Orlando","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. \u2014 NBA scoring leader James Harden of the Houston Rockets practiced with his team for the first time in more than four months Thursday, saying his arrival at the league\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World was delayed by family issues. Harden came to Disney earlier this week, satisfied his league-mandated quarantine requirements and got cleared to participate. \u201cI\u2019m happy I\u2019m here,\u201d Harden said. \u201cIt felt actually really, really good to be out here with the guys, getting after it, just pushing our way. Every single day is going to be a new challenge for us.\u201d Harden has been working out, but said Thursday was his first time playing actual 5-on-5, contact-laden basketball in more than a month. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a good place,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI pushed myself through it today.\u201d Asked about the past four months since the NBA season was put on hold, Harden chose to look ahead with positivity. \u201cI feel like now is a great opportunity to give the world something positive to look forward to\u201d Harden said. \u201cWith the racial issues going on and the COVID and everything, it was just a lot of craziness. Hopefully, we can just keep moving forward.\u201d Harden\u2019s arrival means Houston finally has half of its starting backcourt at Disney. On Monday, guard Russell Westbrook revealed that he tested positive for COVID-19. It\u2019s not known when Westbrook will be ready to arrive. But Harden wasted no time in impressing his teammates. \u201cHe looked good,\u201d Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe probably was rusty for about 30 seconds. \u2026 A good beginning.\u201d Rockets guard Ben McLeMore was more succinct. \u201cSame James. \u2026 Didn\u2019t miss a beat,\u201d McLeMore said. D\u2019Antoni didn\u2019t expect Harden to do much 5-on-5 work initially, figuring he would need some time to build up his wind. But Harden arrived fully ready, in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s eyes, showing that whatever regimen he was following had paid off. \u201cJames is smart,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe knows his body. He knows what he needs to do. He\u2019ll come over late at night if he needs extra shooting or if he needs extra running, he\u2019ll do it. But he loves to play. He\u2019s the ultimate professional on what he needs to do to get ready. So, I trust him totally.\u201d Harden is a virtual cinch to win his third consecutive scoring title. He\u2019s averaging 34.4 points, well ahead of second-place Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards. Beal, who isn\u2019t participating in the restart because of an injury, finished the season averaging 30.5 points. The only way Harden could fall below Beal\u2019s average is if he played in all eight of Houston\u2019s remaining games and scored a total of 11 points or fewer. If Harden played in seven of the eight games and went completely scoreless in each, he would still finish ahead of Beal. Harden would become the seventh player in NBA history to win at least three consecutive scoring crowns, joining George Mikan, Neil Johnston, Wilt Chamberlain, George Gervin, Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant.

(AP) \u2014 NBA referees have not had the same opportunities as players have to knock off the rust from the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Players have been back on the court for a few weeks, with the majority of that time spent getting in individual workouts before practices could resume when the 22 teams arrived at the Walt Disney World bubble. The referees didn\u2019t have that chance. Right now, there\u2019s a healthy amount of nervous anxiety for those who operate the whistles at NBA games with exhibition contests \u2014 the first opportunity for refs to call anything in roughly 4 1\/2 months \u2014 set to begin next week. Like the players and coaches, referees are at Disney and quarantining for what could be a stay of at least a few weeks for most and potentially as much as three months for those who will be assigned to work the NBA Finals. \u201cOur referees are pros and they\u2019re going to come here ready to work,\u201d said Monty McCutchen, the NBA\u2019s vice president and head of referee development and training. \u201cFrom the mental side, we never took any time off, quite frankly.\u201d It will largely be business as usual for referees \u2014 though with two notable differences. The first of those is how the NBA Replay Center will still be operating in Secaucus, New Jersey, but the referees assigned with actually assisting in those situations will be on-site at Disney. The reason is because it didn\u2019t make much logistical sense to send referees into the greater New York City area and have them adhere to local guidelines there by quarantining for 14 days before working games. The replay-tasked referees will be working from a trailer in the broadcast compound outside the three arenas that will be used for games \u2014 with allowances, of course, made for social distancing. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we follow that process because, you know, we want the best working now who have earned that right,\u201d McCutchen said. The other difference will be the noise, or lack thereof. It\u2019s no secret that there is a level of banter between players, coaches and referees during games. When arenas are filled with 20,000 people, the din of crowd noise muffles much of those conversations from the general public. But at Disney, there will be no fans and that means some off-color talks might get picked up on broadcasts. McCutchen isn\u2019t worried. \u201cWe\u2019ll look for a collaboration with coaches and players and I think coaches and players, they\u2019ll figure out how to communicate,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cA lot of yelling that goes on does go on because there\u2019s crowd noise and in a passionate moment you want to be heard you want to be listened to. Without the crowd there, I expect our players and coaches to have an occasional burst, but because they can be heard in a different way, they will communicate in a different way.\u201d There\u2019s a rhythm for players, and the same goes for referees. The NBA sent workout materials to referees during the shutdown \u2014 things like resistance bands, jump ropes and yoga balls \u2014 to help them keep in shape. But much in the same way that it\u2019s hard for players to get into game shape without really playing, the same holds true for referees. Veteran referee Eric Lewis said he\u2019s looking forward to the exhibition games, just to get in some work. \u201cWe really need those,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe really depend on our eyes and having that consistent practice of movement and moving them where they need to be. You don\u2019t see that level of play every day, so now we have to get to where we catch up with the players. Even running \u2014 running those sprints in games and stopping and going are very different than jogging on a treadmill or on the street.\u201d McCutchen and the league\u2019s referee development advisers, a group of top former officials, have been holding regular Zoom calls during the shutdown with the current referee staff to study situations and technique. There have also been tests and other video study done internally, just to keep minds sharp during the weeks away from the court. \u201cThere is not the same rhythm that our teams and referees and coaches have been accustomed to,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a ramp-up time for everyone. That doesn\u2019t excuse bad work, though. We\u2019re going to be grading our officials on the standards of the NBA and to our standard of excellence.\u201d"},{"id":27033,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-sabonis-turner-pairing-pacers","date":"2020-07-16","title":"Film Study: Does the Domantas Sabonis-Myles Turner pairing work ... or not?","content":" The last great Indiana Pacers team started a frontline \u2014 David West and Roy Hibbert \u2014 that attempted 20 total 3-pointers all season. Fast-forward six seasons later and starting two bigs together \u2014 even though they\u2019ve combined to shoot almost 300 3s through 65 games \u2014 is a dicey proposition. Talent is paramount, but fit matters. In modern NBA offenses, shooting and spacing are critical. Domantas Sabonis was a back-up center in first two seasons with Indiana, playing just 698 (19%) of his 3,650 minutes alongside starting center Myles Turner. But Sabonis clearly earned a promotion. This season, he started at power forward, saw his minutes jump * from 24.8 to 34.8 per game and earned his first All-Star berth. (* Sabonis and teammate Aaron Holiday are two of the 11 players who have played in at least 40 games in each of the last two seasons and have averaged at least 10 more minutes per game this season than they did last season.) Though the Pacers\u2019 season was suspended after 65 games, Sabonis and Turner have played more minutes together ( 1,069 ) than they did over the last two seasons combined. Per game, they\u2019ve played three times as many minutes together ( 19.8 ) as they did last season ( 6.7 ). The Pacers\u2019 offense in those 1,069 minutes has not been good. Indiana has scored 105.7 points per 100 possessions with Sabonis and Turner on the floor together, a mark that ranks 479th among 595 two-man combinations that have played at least 500 minutes together. In those minutes, the Pacers have been worse than average in *effective field goal percentage and, despite their size, both free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) and offensive rebounding percentage. (* Effective field goal percentage = (FGM + (0.5 * 3PM)) \/ FGA) Whether Turner is on the floor or not, Sabonis is the hub of the Pacers\u2019 offense \u2014 the Nikola Jokic of the Eastern Conference (though Bam Adebayo also qualifies) and a not-so-unreasonable facsimile of his Hall-of-Fame father. The younger Sabonis leads the league in both elbow touches (8.5) and screen assists (7.0) per game. But a passing-and-screening hub like Sabonis is best surrounded by shooters. The Pacers\u2019 when-everybody\u2019s-healthy starting lineup includes just one player who has shot the league average (35.7%) or better from 3-point range: T.J. Warren (37.5%). He has taken only 21.2% of his shots , a rate that ranks 191st among 229 players with at least 300 total field goal attempts, from beyond the arc. The Pacers\u2019 when-healthy starting guards \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon (31.3%) and Victor Oladipo (30.4%) \u2014 have dealt with injuries and have been better shooters in the past. But given the lack of guys who are comfortable shooting from deep, the Indiana starting lineup remains a clunky group offensively. When Sabonis is setting a high screen or handing off to one of the Pacers\u2019 guards, Turner is sometimes around the paint. That can have the ball-handler dribbling into a crowd or just not getting all the way to the basket . There\u2019s a big difference between shots in the restricted area (made 63% of the time, league-wide) and runners\/floaters from outside the restricted area (40%). But most often, Turner is standing in the corner in an attempt to create space for the Sabonis-centered actions in the middle of the floor. That\u2019s not an ideal use of Turner\u2019s skill set, but he\u2019s a willing spacer (he gets to his spot and doesn\u2019t wander inside the arc) and that arrangement can work. Sabonis has shot better with Turner on the floor (56%) than he has with Turner off the floor (52%), only seeing a small drop in the percentage of his shots that have come in the restricted area (55% with Turner on, 59% with Turner off). Play 1. On a sideline out-of-bounds play, Turner bumps Kristaps Porzingis with a cross-screen that allows Sabonis to establish good post position. He then knocks Porzingis under the basket and finishes on the other side. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Sabonis ranks ninth with 6.1 post-ups per game. According to Synergy tracking, the 0.91 points per possession he\u2019s scored on post-ups ranks 19th among 30 players who have averaged at least two post-up possessions per game. Play 2. After Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis expertly defend a Sabonis-Victor Oladipo two-man game, Sabonis gets the ball to Aaron Holiday and sets a screen on the left side of the floor. Jayson Tatum sinks into the paint on the weak side and Holiday makes a terrific skip pass to Turner for a right-corner 3. Number to know: Turner has taken 44.3% of his shots from 3-point range, up from 25.1% last season . That\u2019s the seventh biggest jump among 200 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. His rate hasn\u2019t been much higher with Sabonis on the floor (46.1%) than it\u2019s been with him off the floor (42.3%). Play 3. With Sabonis and Turner on the floor, the Pacers have a size advantage against the Celtics. Here, Turner uses it for one of his 20 put-back buckets this season. Number to know: The Pacers are one of four teams that rank in the bottom 10 in both offensive rebounding percentage and defensive rebounding percentage. Play 4. On a Oladipo-Sabonis pick-and-roll, Semi Ojeleye doesn\u2019t fully commit to tagging from the weak side and Oladipo hits the rolling Sabonis with a between-the-legs bounce pass. Number to know: Sabonis has averaged a league-high 5.6 roll-man possessions per game. Play 5. Against the Celtics, it might not matter as much, but having Turner in the strong -side corner when Sabonis rolls to the basket means that the weak-side help is coming from a guard or small forward. Finishing over a smaller defender (Kemba Walker on this play) is easier than finishing against Turner\u2019s man helping in the paint. Number to know: The 1.11 points per possession that Sabonis has scored on roll-man possessions ranks 15th among 27 players who have averaged at least 2.5 per game. Alas, Turner has shot just 34.4% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, a mark that ranks 59th among 67 players who have attempted at least 200. When he\u2019s been on the floor with Sabonis, the Pacers have taken only 60% of their shots from the restricted area or 3-point range. They rank 27th overall in that regard, but they\u2019ve seen a big jump (to 67%) in minutes when Sabonis or Turner have been on the floor without the other. When it comes down to it, defenses won\u2019t give Turner much respect as a floor-spacer, making it tougher for the Pacers to get good shots around Sabonis at the top of the floor, especially because he doesn\u2019t space to the 3-point line himself. Play 1. Smart denies the hand-off from Sabonis to Oladipo, so Oladipo cuts back the other way and collapses the defense. He makes a terrific wraparound pass to Turner in the left corner, but Turner passes up the open 3, the Pacers lose their advantage, and T.J. Warren misses a heave from the right wing. Number to know: The Pacers rank last in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (31.1%), and are in the bottom five for the fourth straight season. Play 2. With the score tied late, the Pacers get Walker switched onto the ball for an Oladipo-Sabonis pick-and-roll. Hayward leaves Turner alone in the corner to rotate over to Sabonis\u2019 short roll. Sabonis kicks to the open Turner, but Hayward runs him off the initial shot and he misses the side-step 3-pointer. Number to know: Sabonis and Turner have played 90 \u201cclutch\u201d minutes together this season after playing just nine clutch minutes together through Sabonis\u2019 first two seasons with the Pacers. Play 3. With the Pacers now down two points, the same thing happens on the next possession. This time, Turner slides down the baseline, drawing the attention of Smart. That leaves Aaron Holiday open on the weak side, but by the time Sabonis\u2019 pass gets there, Tatum recovers. Both Holiday and Oladipo have Sabonis open beyond the arc, but neither passes him the ball (he\u2019s a 25% 3-point shooter) and Oladipo misses a contested, pull-up 3 as the shot clock expires. Number to know: The Pacers rank 23rd in clutch offense , having scored 104.1 points per 100 possessions with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. Coach Nate McMillan hasn\u2019t staggered the minutes of Sabonis and Turner so that one of the two has been on the floor at all (non-garbage) times, because he\u2019s wanted to give rookie center Goga Bitadze some meaningful burn. But the Pacers will usually begin the second and fourth quarters with Sabonis on the floor alongside four reserves. The Pacers\u2019 second most-used lineup \u2014 T.J. McConnell, Aaron Holiday, Justin Holiday, Doug McDermott and Sabonis \u2014 is the league\u2019s only lineup made up mostly of reserves that has played at least 200 minutes this season. It\u2019s not the Mavs\u2019 dominant Dirk Nowitzki-plus-bench second unit (for which McDermott played a role) of two seasons ago, but its been somewhat effective, outscoring opponents by 7.2 points per 100 possessions, more efficient offensively than the starters. The lineup includes another guard \u2014 McConnell \u2014 who can\u2019t shoot. But it also includes two wings \u2014 McDermott (44.5%) and Justin Holiday (42.4%) \u2014 who rank in the top 10 in 3-point percentage. Putting four perimeter players around Sabonis unleashes more of his skills as an offensive hub. Play 1. On a McConnell\/Sabonis pick-and-roll, McDermott is in the left-corner spot that Turner often occupies. McConnell gets into the paint with his speed and kicks out to a quick-release 3 from McDermott. Number to know: McConnell ranks fifth in assist-turnover ratio (3.67). He\u2019s recorded assists on 40.6% of his possessions, the highest rate among 307 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 games or more. Play 2. McDermott occupies that left corner a lot too. Here, he takes his preferred path out of that corner to take a hand-off from Sabonis and drain a pull-up 3-pointer. Number to know: Though six other Pacers have played more minutes alongside Sabonis than McDermott has (813), Sabonis\u2019 74 assists to McDermott are the most he has to any teammate. Play 3. When J.J. Barea prevents that same hand-off from Sabonis to McDermott, the big man pitches to McConnell in the corner and follows up with a screen. McConnell gets into the paint, draws Willie Cauley-Stein over, and tosses a soft alley-oop to a rolling Sabonis. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum tracking, McConnell and McDermott have averaged 4.57 and 4.56 miles per hour, respectively. Those are the third-and fifth-fastest rates among 285 players who have played at least 750 minutes. Play 4. When the Mavs deny the initial \u201cfloppy\u201d action, Sabonis flashes to the ball. After letting both McConnell and Justin Holiday go by, he initiates a hand-off with McDermott, coming from the top of the arc. With Dorian Finney-Smith getting bumped by the screen and Porzingis in drop coverage, McDermott steps into a pull-up jumper from just above the elbow. Number to know: McDermott ranks fifth in the league in 3-point percentage, but more than half of Sabonis\u2019 assists to him (39\/74) have been on 2-point buckets. Play 5. When McDermott curls around a Sabonis screen to the top of the arc, he\u2019s met by both Derrick Favors (hedging off Sabonis) and Jrue Holiday (pinching off McConnell). He pitches back to McConnell who attacks the seam of the defense, gets Favors turned around, and kicks back to Sabonis. McDermott doesn\u2019t stop moving and Sabonis hits him with a wicked, one-handed bounce pass for a layup. Number to know: McDermott has been assisted on 93.4% of his buckets, the third highest rate among 164 players with at least 200 field goals. Lineup functionality and success is about more than just offense, and the Sabonis-Turner combination has worked defensively. The two bigs will each have their moments where they look too slow to defend the perimeter, but the seventh-ranked Indiana defense has been better with both on the floor ( 103.6 points allowed per 100 possessions ) than it has with only one of the two (108.3). And that\u2019s with the opponent more likely to have its starters on the floor against the Pacers\u2019 own starting group than it is when only one of Indy\u2019s two bigs are in the game. While the Indiana starting lineup might not be the most swift of foot, it puts in work defensively. In 605 total minutes with Brogdon, Warren, Sabonis and Turner on the floor, the Pacers have allowed less than a point per possession. That\u2019s the best mark among 52 non-Milwaukee four-man groups that have played at least 500 minutes together. The Pacers\u2019 defense starts in transition. According to Second Spectrum tracking, only 13.4% of their opponents\u2019 shots, the league\u2019s lowest opponent rate, have come in the first six seconds of the shot clock. And according to Synergy tracking, they\u2019ve allowed 1.05 points per possession, the league\u2019s second-best mark , in transition. Turner being on the perimeter on offense can allow him to more quickly get back in transition and protect the rim. Though they have a size advantage against a lot of opponents, the Pacers rank 27th in offensive rebounding percentage , because their bigs do not crash the glass. Play 1. After Sabonis gets blocked by Brook Lopez, Eric Bledsoe pushes the ball up the floor. Oladipo stays in front of him, and when he loses his footing, Sabonis has recovered back to challenge Bledsoe at the rim. Bledsoe kicks the ball out to Khris Middleton and Warren rotates over. Turner then rotates out to Wesley Matthews in the corner and when Matthews tries to beat Turner baseline, he\u2019s met by Oladipo. When Bledsoe dives to the rim behind Oladipo, Turner slides over to contest his floater. Number to know: Opponents have shot 52.6% at the rim when Turner has been there to protect it. That\u2019s the eighth-best rim-protection mark among 34 players who have defended at least five shots at the rim per game. Play 2. Turner switches a Luka Doncic-Porzingis pick-and-roll. Though he doesn\u2019t bite for the step-back hesitation move, he does get beat by a left-to-right crossover. But Oladipo is there in the paint to draw a charge. Number to know: Oladipo has drawn 0.9 charges per 36 minutes, second-most among 397 players who have played at least 250 minutes this season. Play 3. The Pacers commit a turnover, but get back before the Mavs can make anything of it. Sabonis eventually switches another screen and the 7-foot-3 Porzingis tries to back down the 6-foot Aaron Holiday. But he doesn\u2019t get very far and Holiday forces a tough mid-range jumper. Number to know: Though the starting lineup held the Mavs\u2019 No. 1 offense to just 40 points on 44 possessions in the Pacers\u2019 second-to-last game before the season was suspended, Indiana ranks just 17th defensively (having allowed 113.1 points per 100 possessions in 19 games) against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses . Play 4. Turner switches another Doncic-Porzingis pick-and-roll. Holiday sinks into the paint to help Warren in the post against Porzingis, but is able to recover when Doncic throws a skip pass to Courtney Lee in the left corner. When he runs Lee off the 3-point line, Sabonis rotates over to contest the baseline jumper. Turner then rotates down to bump Sabonis\u2019 man (Maxi Kleber) off the rebound. Number to know: Opponents have shot 59.6% at the rim when Sabonis has been there to protect it. That mark ranks 25th among the 34 players who have defended at least five shots at the rim per game. Play 5. Holiday is able to stay with Tim Hardaway Jr. when he slips out of a screen for Doncic (with a back-screen from Porzingis). When Porzingis flips the screen, Turner hedges and both Oladipo and Sabonis quickly rotate to meet Porzingis\u2019 roll into the paint. Two Mavs are now open on the weak side, but Holiday anticipates and intercepts Porzingis\u2019 off-balance kick out to Kleber. Number to know: The Pacers are in position to rank in the top 10 defensively for the seventh time in the last nine seasons. It seems unlikely that the Pacers will keep both Sabonis and Turner through the ends of their current contracts. Sabonis\u2019 four-year, $75-million extension kicks in next season, while Turner still has three years and $54 million left on his deal. With Brogdon owed $65 million over the next three seasons and Oladipo eligible for an extension this fall, the Pacers will have to explore some options. This season has given them some data to work with in regard to the viability of their frontline, though Oladipo\u2019s absence for the first 47 games (and rustiness upon his return) has prevented us from seeing this edition of the Pacers at full strength. Even with a healthy backcourt, the offensive fit of the Pacers\u2019 starting lineup is not great. They\u2019d certainly have a higher ceiling with more speed and better shooting around Sabonis. But finding the perfect complement on the frontline is much easier said than done and, with Turner and a top-10 defense, the Pacers can keep themselves competitive as is. There\u2019s hope that Oladipo can play when the season resumes. That would make Indiana one of the more interesting teams to watch in Orlando. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2013 \u2013 Every team in the NBA bubble has played golf. Most have had at least a few players go fishing. Some have taken boats out. Bowling is available for a few hours most nights. The barbers arrive for the first time later this week. And the walking trail is pretty much always occupied by coaches or players. On occasion at Walt Disney World, basketball even gets played. This is the NBA\u2019s home away from home for the foreseeable future \u2014 and efforts are being made to make the time here fun. The so-called bubble in Central Florida is where 22 teams have settled for about a week now, where they all will remain for another month and where teams that make the playoffs will be for considerably longer. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to just live our life,\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHave our best Disney life.\u201d This summer away from home isn\u2019t ideal, for obvious reasons. Players and coaches are away from their families, many teams are missing players or other personnel because of the coronavirus, and there are daily reminders that even this well-isolated world was created during a pandemic. Medical personnel \u2014 wearing gowns, masks, gloves and plastic visors \u2014 are arriving to place a swab in everyone\u2019s mouth and two more in their nasal passages for the next COVID-19 test. But the league is trying to make the days at Disney go a little faster, with activities available almost around the clock. And players are making the best of things; Denver even turned an off day into time for a full-team pool workout this week. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever build enough \u2018we,\u2019 enough togetherness,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. Golf has been the free-time hit so far; a new private driving range just for NBA player use is scheduled to open Saturday, just to keep up with their demand. A few players \u2014 including some who don\u2019t even play golf regularly, like Miami\u2019s Goran Dragic \u2014 figured they might as well try to learn the game. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for me mentally to have something else to think about during the downtime,\u201d said Dragic, whose wife and children returned home to the family\u2019s native Slovenia on Wednesday. \u201cSo, I had my golf clubs sent here, just to try something new.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s the food. Panned by some players upon arrival, the fare in quarantine wasn\u2019t quite the level that NBA types are used to seeing but has generally gotten decent reviews since. Those still in quarantine at Disney get three meals dropped off outside their door each day, with an array of items to choose from in those bags. Teams have meal rooms set up with menus that were developed in cooperation with their own staffs and dietitians. And when all else fails, there are delivery options and room service offering everything from bisques to steaks to flourless chocolate cakes. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about it being a five-star restaurant, no, but if you talk about it being good food that you can eat and enjoy, I think it is,\u201d New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not eating off of fine china, but we\u2019re also eating off of biodegradable containers which I think is very smart to do. Obviously, we\u2019re not eating with silverware because that poses a threat as far as spreading the virus also.\u201d The NBA even developed an app for the Disney life. Every team was assigned a liaison to help book outings and handle needs, and the app includes everything from how to get food delivered to how to book extra practice time. There\u2019s a page within the app that allows players to report violations of health protocols, such as someone not wearing a mask, as well as links to mental health resources and even details on how players can register to vote if they haven\u2019t already. In short, there are many ways to keep busy in the bubble. \u201cI brought my bike \u2014 it\u2019s yet to leave the room, but the thought is nice, hopefully someday I get on it,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to do. It\u2019s still not normal, but that\u2019s fine with us.

(AP) \u2014 Formulating a plan to get a team ready for the restart of the NBA season wasn\u2019t as difficult as one might expect for Indiana coach Nate McMillan. Turns out, he\u2019s been through something similar to this before. Spending an extended stretch away from home during the summer, while unprecedented as part of an NBA season, isn\u2019t exactly a foreign concept for those with USA Basketball experience like the Olympics and the World Cup. Plenty of players and coaches at Walt Disney World see parallels between those experiences and this challenge. \u201cI had that opportunity to work with the Olympic team and preparation was very similar to what we\u2019re going through here,\u201d said McMillan, who was an assistant under Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski on the USA Basketball staff from 2006 through 2012. \u201cHaving a training camp, basically, at a hotel and getting ready for a 45- to 60-day season. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have three scrimmage games, eight so-called regular season games and then we\u2019re in the playoffs so it\u2019s very similar to preparing to play for the gold medal.\u201d Players who have been through the World Cup or Olympic grinds agree that there\u2019s a level of familiarity with this sort of schedule and situation. \u201cIt helps tremendously,\u201d said Toronto guard Kyle Lowry, who was part of the U.S. gold-medal-winning team at the Olympics in 2016. \u201cIn Rio it was a lot more strict and tighter because we were living on a boat. That experience was pretty awesome. \u2026 But living on a boat, to be in a smaller room and not have as many amenities it really kind of prepared me for this.\u201d Even players who have been part of USA Basketball\u2019s events for younger players, like Under-18 or Under-19 tournaments internationally, know the drill when it comes to living in a hotel for a few weeks and not having a lot of latitude when it comes to being free to roam. Players at Disney cannot leave the campus because of coronavirus protocols, though the league has made plenty of entertainment options \u2014 fishing, golf, boating, table tennis and more \u2014 available to them. Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said he would follow much of the same policies that the U.S. program used when he was an assistant on those national-team staffs, such as a heavy reliance on medical personnel to determine what days to have a hard practice and what days to take it a bit easier. Phoenix coach Monty Williams said he also refreshed his memory on national-team days when putting together a plan for his team\u2019s stay at Disney. \u201cIt has forced me to dig into the archives of that time with USA Basketball,\u201d said Williams, another former national team assistant under Krzyzewski. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of the players say that it reminds them of AAU, but for me it reminds me so much of my time in Spain at the World Cup. It\u2019s a bit longer than the Olympics \u2026 and you have a lot of free time.\u201d Pacers center Myles Turner was with the U.S. team that competed in China last summer at the World Cup, a group that spent more than seven weeks together between training camp, exhibition games in the U.S. and Australia, and then the tournament itself. The Pacers have clinched a playoff spot, so they\u2019re assured of spending at least seven weeks at Disney this summer. It\u2019s another long summer for Turner, and he\u2019s not complaining. \u201cThere is a lot of similarity in how it\u2019s set up, but for me personally, I just think that it\u2019s a great time for everybody to kind of stay focused,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThere\u2019s no distractions. Everybody\u2019s locked in and focused. So, there\u2019s really not a lot that can go wrong in a basketball sense.\u201d One difference at Disney is that nobody has family members with them until at least the second round of the playoffs. At an Olympics, it\u2019s typical for family and friends to make the trip \u2014 and at last year\u2019s World Cup, a small number of players also made arrangements for family to join them in China. \u201cThis is a little bit different than that, but certainly the timing is similar and the timing for us as far as preparation is probably more like a FIBA-type schedule than it is like a training camp,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cYou\u2019re practicing for a couple weeks and then you\u2019re playing a few games and then it really, really counts.\u201d"}]
