What size ball should they be using? Should there be a 3-point line? Should they play man-to-man or zone defense? Should there be a shot clock? These are all questions posed by parents, coaches and youth basketball organizations throughout the country. But there have never been universal answers to those questions as different organizations often played by different rules. A child could play on a nine-foot rim with a smaller ball in one league, then have to play on a 10-foot rim with a larger ball in another. That lack of uniformity in youth basketball development led the National Basketball Association and USA Basketball to come together to establish guidelines to promote health and wellness, skill development and enjoyment of the game for boys and girls of all different age ranges. \u201cOur sport has lacked governance at the youth level so we came together really to establish what we think are a series of best practices for how to play the game at the youth level,\u201d said David Krichavsky, Vice President of Youth Basketball Development at the NBA. After announcing the Health and Wellness guidelines in Oct. 2016, the two organizations are ready to implement next step in their quest to improve the state of youth basketball in this country. That step is today\u2019s announcement of a set of age-appropriate rules and standards for youth basketball competitions, which includes recommendations surrounding equipment, court specifications, game structure, playing tactics and rules of the game. \u201cWhat we tried to do is address questions that we would get all the time, whether it be from individual parents or the commissioners or coaches,\u201d said Krichavsky. \u201cWe can answer all of those questions on a one-off basis, but now we have a set of standards that we can point everyone to and a set of standards that was developed by experts in our game and experts on youth development. So it will create a level of consistency that never existed before.\u201d The goal of these new guidelines is to establish the proper setting to help young players learn the fundamentals of the game, build their skills, achieve early success and provide long-term development opportunities. By using the Youth Basketball Player Segmentation Model, the rules and standards are specific to four age groups: ages 7-8, ages 9-1, ages 12-4 and grades 9-12. As players grow in their development, the guidelines adjust with them to keep them on track for success, growth and enjoyment. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to get these out and think it\u2019s well overdue here in this country,\u201d said Jim Tooley, the Chief Executive Officer of USA Basketball. \u201cWe\u2019re the only country really that plays by multiple sets of rules compared to other parts of the world where everyone is pretty much playing FIBA standard rules across the board.\u201d Highlights from the new rules and standards include the recommended use of: The complete guidelines can be found at: https:\/\/youthguidelines.nba.com\/ \u201cAs the chairman of both USA Basketball and the Jr. NBA Leadership Council, as well as a parent whose kids grew up playing and loving the game of basketball, I\u2019m proud that the NBA and USA Basketball are working together to develop and share these important guidelines, \u201c said Martin E. Dempsey, USA Basketball Chairman and Jr. NBA Leadership Council Chairman, Retired General. \u201cThe new guidelines include age-specific rules and standards that will ensure a balanced and positive basketball experience for youth of all ages.\u201d In terms of equal playing time, the key is helping coaches find the right balance between participation and competition. \u201cA key point here is that you never know whether a young boy or young girl is going to evolve into being a great player,\u201d said Tooley. \u201cThis is designed for all kids; a lot of these kids won\u2019t make their high school team let alone go to college on a D-I scholarship and end up in the NBA or WNBA. This is designed for them to have success on their own pathway and to have success you have to be a part of it, you have to participate, you have to play.\u201d When it comes to the 3-point shot, Tooley recalls conversations he\u2019s had with a friend who coaches a group of nine-year-olds that are all eager to imitate Stephen Curry by launching 3-pointers from 25-plus feet from the basket. Krichavsky has seen it plenty of times as well. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all seen those examples of kids moving beyond the arc and shooting from their hips and really shooting with technique that is really not the appropriate technique,\u201d Krichavsky said. \u201cSo if we take that line away and teach kids proper form and reinforce that. Certainly we can bring that line back \u2013 and in our guidelines we do that \u2013 but it gives the opportunity to learn proper shooting form and reinforce that from appropriate ranges and then continue to have them step back. But keep that proper shooting form as they do so.\u201d Perhaps the most difficult practices to adopt will be the ones involving new equipment. Not many youth organizations currently have shot clocks. Not everyone has baskets that are adjustable to different heights to accommodate different age groups. While it may take time for all of these guidelines to be implemented across the board, both the NBA and USA Basketball have upcoming events that will highlight these new rules and standards. \u201cOur working group was pretty diverse; we had folks from the NCAA, high schools and AAU involved [in establishing these guidelines] so we\u2019re hopeful that will help spread these rules and standards,\u201d said Tooley. \u201cAnd both the NBA through their Jr. NBA World Championship and USA Basketball with our U.S. Open Basketball Championships, we have our universe and touch points with a lot of youth basketball organizations that is much bigger than its ever been. So we\u2019re going to be adopting these rules and standards along the way and we just hope it becomes adopted over time.\u201d With the guidelines available for everyone to learn and implement as well as seeing examples of those guidelines in action at the Jr. NBA World Championship and U.S. Open Basketball Championships this spring and summer, what are the next steps for the NBA and USA Basketball in their continued quest to improve youth basketball? \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch and listen, get feedback and see what we\u2019re hearing out there and respond accordingly,\u201d said Tooley. \u201cBut we feel pretty bullish that these are really solid principles to go by and both of our respective tournaments that we\u2019ll be having will yield a lot of influence in this space as well. And I know both the Jr. NBA and USA Basketball are excited to get those up and running this summer.\u201d"},{"id":41254,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-report-stephen-curry-targets-friday-return","date":"2018-03-20","title":"Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry cleared to participate in full team practices","content":"After losing their fourth All-Star to injury on Monday night, the Golden State Warriors may get at least one back in the mix later this week.

Kevin Love, who was inactive since Jan. 31 after suffering a broken hand, made his return to the Cavs\u2019 starting lineup and played 25 minutes in their 124-117 victory over Milwaukee on Monday night. The five-time All-Star finished with 18 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks while shooting 4-for-9 from 3-point range. The Cavs were 30-20, third place in the Eastern Conference, when Love went down. They went just 10-9 in his absence, but despite that have maintained their standing in the East. That span included Cleveland\u2019s roster-shaking trade deadline day, which saw six players shipped out and four new ones arrive. One of their most productive newcomers, Larry Nance Jr., sat out his third straight game due to a strained hamstring. The team suffered their latest blow earlier on Monday, when coach Tyronn Lue announced he would be stepping away from the team for at least one week to address personal health issues . Love, however, contributed immediately for a Cavs team that hopes to contend for its fourth consecutive Eastern Conference crown. Cleveland trails second-place Boston by six games.

I locked eyes with the Cleveland Cavaliers coach as he exited United Center Saturday night, having stayed in the locker room for the second half of his team\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls with unspecified \u201cillness\u201d issues. With a vulnerable, clammy and weary expression on his face, he looked like a man who needed to do exactly what he did Monday \u2013 take a leave of absence from his Cavs duties to get his priorities, notably his health, straight. Lue, 40, announced his decision to temporarily step away from the white board in a statement released by the Cavaliers . \u201cI have had chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep, throughout the year,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a battery of tests, there have been no conclusions as to what the exact issue is.\u201d Initial reports were that Lue would sit out a week before rejoining the team, although when Charlotte\u2019s Steve Clifford similarly tapped out early this season to put his health first, he was gone for six weeks after being diagnosed with severe sleep deprivation. It\u2019s been said that most NBA coaches sleep like babies: a few hours here and there, interrupted by fits of wailing. Neither Lue nor Cleveland general manager Koby Altman, in his supportive comment (\u201cWe know how difficult these circumstances are,\u201d Altman said) used the word \u201cstress\u201d in assessing Lue\u2019s condition. But they could have, because stress is the elephant in almost every coach\u2019s room. That\u2019s no \u201cEureka!\u201d diagnosis, by the way. The trick is understanding that stress can manifest itself in as many ways as it\u2019s generated. Among the obvious ones, there is stress to win. Then, having won, there is stress to keep winning. Stress from lofty expectations and sustained excellence, which both the Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are facing at unprecedented levels by NBA standards as they try to line up for a fourth consecutive Finals clash. Stress comes, too, from falling short of such expectations. As well as nosediving into a losing streak, making a dumb mistake or, deep in one\u2019s gut, being exposed as unworthy altogether. There\u2019s stress when the team flight leaves late due to a weather or mechanical issue. Stress over a digital scouting tool that doesn\u2019t fire up precisely when needed. Stress to manage your players\u2019 minutes, develop that raw young guy or heed a rehabber\u2019s injury restrictions. Always, there\u2019s the original and inevitable stress to beat the other team, whose coach may be as stressed as you. It would be na\u00efve in considering Lue\u2019s case not to explore the stress of coaching LeBron James. Just as there are special opportunities and privileges that come with having the best player in basketball on your side, there is duty, obligation and stress to working with him, too. Specifically, that means maximizing his talents and experience to the beat of a ticking clock that represents his useful remaining court life or contract term, against the backdrop of the superstar\u2019s own agenda. James burns to win \u2013 it\u2019s his raison d\u2019\u00eatre for pushing toward 82 appearances this season, for delving deep into personal training methods to stay resilient and available at age 33. His high basketball IQ, lauded by so many (including James), means he functions as half-a-coach most of the time, with the sway he holds over every organization for which he plays suggesting the other half at times. James\u2019 personality, frequently described as passive-aggressive, keeps pressure on all around him, whether it\u2019s a current or former teammate like Kyrie Irving to fill and accept the role James sized up for him, a GM like Altman to make roster moves at the trade deadline under an implicit or-else, or an owner like Dan Gilbert to spend extravagantly into a payroll spill of luxury-tax red in hopes of fulfilling James\u2019 ambitions. No one, however, shoulders more pressure to keep up with James \u2013 and the stress that can comes with it \u2013 than his head coaches. On game nights or on practice days, drawing up Xs & Os, knowing how hard to scrimmage or giving the squad a day off entirely. As vocal as James was in supporting Lue when he took over for former coach David Blatt midway through the Cavs\u2019 2015-16 championship season, and as understanding as he sounded in talking about the coach\u2019s health Saturday night and sudden sabbatical Monday \u2013 \u201cLike losing one of your best players,\u201d James said, calling Lue \u201cthe captain of the ship\u201d \u2013 the four-time MVP sure likely has added to Lue\u2019s predicament. With his presence, with with his capabilities and, yes, with his manner too. Before Lue took ill Saturday, conversations I had around United Center with several longtime NBA insiders centered on the challenge of coaching James for his personality, not his athletic gifts. Specifically, I sought their reactions to the sideline scene captured on cameras in Portland Thursday when James barked at Lue on Cleveland\u2019s bench and Lue felt compelled to bark back. The score had gone south. The Cavs were on No. 5 of a six-game, 11-day trip. They were headed to a 15-20 record since their high-water mark of 24-9 on Dec. 21 eight weeks earlier. They essentially have been three teams in one this season: Pre-trade, post-trade and injury-riddled. So when James and Lue started up, the players and assistant coaches in between looked like kids staring hard at the TV while their parents argued. Lue dismissed it afterward as a miscommunication over James\u2019 desire to be subbed out sooner. A couple of folks attributed it to disagreement over shot selection, as in putting the ball on the floor vs. settling for a jumper. No one hinted it reached any sort of \u201cI hate you! Yeah, well I hate you too!\u201d irreconcilable level, though a few guessers and snarkers on social media dusted off the \u201cThere goes Ty Lue yelling at the Cavs\u2019 coach again\u201d memes. But the optics. Oh, the optics. Having that sort of exchange \u2013 urgent, heated, even hypothetically personal \u2013 away from prying eyes is no biggie in sports. But James has had them repeatedly with just about every coach for whom he has played. From disagreement with Paul Silas, who coached him his first two seasons, to the shoulder shiver he had for Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra in their first season together. From shoving Blatt aside to keep the coach from getting a technical foul to vetoing his last-second playoff strategy against Chicago in 2015. From the timeout huddle James animatedly took over against Toronto in January, his voice and gestures drowning out the staff\u2019s, all the way to last week\u2019s mini-drama at the Moda Center. Some qualifiers are in order here: Thirty NBA coaches would welcome James on their roster. Most would appreciate his input, however vocal and passionate, based on his knowledge not just of his skills but those of the other nine guys on the floor at any given moment. As for anyone who doesn\u2019t accept the expectations and pressure that come with coaching him \u2013 the stress \u2013 well, there are a bunch of comfortable Division III or G League jobs where the spotlight doesn\u2019t burn at all. It\u2019s equally fair to say, though, that James has had more coach commotions captured and archived than any elite player in NBA history. Some of that is a by-product of performing in this 24\/7 media age. Some of it undoubtedly is an outgrowth of James\u2019 status, alone perhaps in team sports, as a partner rather than just a player, a co-everything \u2013 coach, GM, owner \u2013 in impact and self-awareness beyond outrageously salaried employee. But some of it, too, is a style that\u2019s indulgent and chaneable. Such that even NBA insiders, Cavs personnel or scouts were left struggling to defend it or shaking their heads. \u201cLook, they were playing cards on the flight from Portland the day after,\u201d one said. \u201cBut would it be better to do that [arguing] behind closed doors? Yes it would.\u201d Said another, after Lue stayed in the locker room for Saturday\u2019s second half: \u201cMaybe he just decided, \u2018I\u2019ve tried. Somebody else try.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen a coach gets called out by a star,\u201d said a third, \u201che has to go back at him. Because the other players are watching.\u201d Maybe Lue\u2019s need to attend to his health is wholly physical, something to be remedied with melatonin and a more consistent bedtime. Maybe it\u2019s the equivalent of Dickens\u2019 undigested bit of beef, blot of mustard or fragment of underdone potato, which was what Scrooge was rooting for before he got his reset. Or maybe it stems in some part from the power dynamic unique to the Cavaliers, largely created and certainly embraced by James, mostly for the organization\u2019s good but not without some unintended consequences. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

According to ESPN.com\u2019s Jeff Goodman, the University of Memphis has agreed to a deal for former Tigers star Anfernee \u201cPenny\u201d Hardaway to become the school\u2019s next coach. Hardaway would replace Tubby Smith, who was fired after just two months earlier this season. The news was also reported by Mark Giannotto of The Commercial Appeal .  Here\u2019s more from Goodman on Memphis\u2019 new coach: Over the weekend, Hardaway led East High School to its third-straight TSSAA Class AAA state championship . Memphis finished with a 21-13 record this season but missed the postseason for the fourth straight year. Hardaway rose to stardom playing alongside fellow superstar Shaquille O\u2019Neal on the Orlando Magic teams of the mid-1990s. He was a four-time All-Star from 1995-98 and made the All-NBA first team 1993-94, \u201994-95 and \u201995-96 and the All-NBA third team in 1996-97. Hardaway, who played 14 seasons in the NBA, helped drive the Magic to their first NBA Finals berth in 1995 \u2014 a series in which they were swept by the Houston Rockets . Hardaway played for the Magic for six seasons, averaging 19 points, 6.3 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 1.95 steals. However, his tenure with the Magic did not end smoothly. He clashed with then-coach Brian Hill in 1997, taking part in a player revolt that led to the former coach\u2019s firing. Hardaway was also hampered by a knee injury suffered early in the 1997-98 season that sapped him of some of his athleticism. The Magic traded him to the Phoenix Suns in August of 1999, where Hardaway played 4 1\/2 seasons before being dealt to the New York Knicks. His last season in the NBA came in 2007-08, where he teamed with O\u2019Neal as a member of the Miami Heat. Last year, the Magic made Hardaway the fifth player in team history to be inducted into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame . * * *"},{"id":41262,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2017-18-week-23","date":"2018-03-19","title":"Week 23 Power Rankings: Teams at top gain separation as season winds down","content":" With less than four weeks to go before the playoffs begin, things are finally starting to get sorted in the Eastern and Western Conference standings , at least at the top.

If you notice something different during the upcoming playoffs, it\u2019s probably all the guys playing meaningful postseason roles for their teams who \u2026 never saw Michael Jordan play meaningful postseason games. (Pause here to pour one out for myself.) Rarely have the playoffs approached with so many teams being so dependent on young guys contributing in meaningful roles. Almost every team currently in the mix has multiple guys who\u2019ve never or barely played in the postseason in their current rotations. Barring injuries, they\u2019re likely to stay in those rotations when the playoffs begin. From Toronto (where rookie O.G. Anunoby has started most of the year at small forward, and whose bench is comprised of kid after kid \u2014 Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam, Jakob Poeltl and Delon Wright) to Boston (which has started Jaylen Brown at the two all season and Jayson Tatum at the three since Gordon Hayward\u2019s season-ending injury ) to Philly (with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and Robert Covington all starting a Blutarsky of total playoff games (as in, zero) between them ), kids are in the mix. * Playoff picture:  Chases tighten in East, West \u201cA lot is made about how they\u2019re going to perform in the playoffs,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said of his young guys. \u201cBut, again, I can\u2019t find that manual anywhere that says you have to shorten the rotation in the playoffs. It\u2019s written somewhere, \u2018cause everybody keeps asking the question. I must have missed that memo.\u201d In an era of $200 million max deals, you have to \u2014 have to \u2014 find three to five players that can contribute for (relatively) little money. Most of the time, that\u2019s going to be players on rookie deals, who teams can control for up to five years (and, not unimportantly, get some of their most productive seasons out of them during that stretch). Player development has been crucial in the league for pretty much the last decade, and with one-to-one G League affiliations for all 30 teams just around the corner it will become even more so. The Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo is a playoff graybeard compared to some others in the Eastern Conference \u2014 he has 12 whole postseason games: six in 2014-15, six last season \u2014 under his belt. The Bucks\u2019 starting point guard, Eric Bledsoe, has a whopping 17 playoff games to his credit \u2014 though none have come since 2013. The Indiana Pacers\u2019 Victor Oladipo got his first taste of the postseason last year in a supporting role to Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City, and shot 34.4 percent \u2014 24 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 in the Thunder\u2019s five-game first-round loss to Houston . LeBron James will start his push for an eighth straight Finals appearance overall, and fourth in a row in Cleveland, depending on Larry Nance, Jr. (zero playoff appearances), Jordan Clarkson (zero playoff appearances) and Rodney Hood (11 playoff games total, all last season with the Utah Jazz) all now in the Cavaliers\u2019 rotation. Dwyane Wade has played in more playoff games \u2014 172 \u2014 than the bulk of his Miami Heat teammates combined . Thirteen of his 14 teammates have played a total of 141 playoff games, and 30 of those are by Goran Dragic. (Udonis Haslem, little-used this season at 37, has played in 147 career postseason games.) \u201cI think you just have to trust that the regular season, the battles throughout the regular season, seasoned guys enough to be prepared for that next stage,\u201d said Heat guard Wayne Elliington, who logged 14 postseason minutes in two games for Dallas in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of young guys on our team, case in point. I\u2019ve seen guys have big games. They rise to the competition. Hopefully that\u2019s what it\u2019ll be about in the playoffs with us.\u201d There\u2019s more experience in the Western Conference, but even there, teams such as the Minnesota Timberwolves have key players like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins who\u2019ve never been in a playoff game. The New Orleans Pelicans will be counting on Anthony Davis ( four playoff games total in his first five NBA seasons ) to lead them, when the officiating is different and the game plans are more detailed, with the best coaches in the world devising ways to stop you. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking this. \u201cIn 2008 when we won, we had (Kendrick) Perkins, (Rajon) Rondo, Baby (Glen Davis), and (Leon) Powe,\u201d said Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge. \u201cLate firsts and second-round picks. They all contributed a lot. It\u2019s nothing new. In managing the salary cap, you need rookie scale and or minimum contracts.\u201d Or, maybe I\u2019m not. Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown noted that his young players, who handle the ball the most on his team, have to cut down on their turnovers going into the playoffs \u2014 a belief he reiterated over the weekend . In doing so he sounded an awful lot like Steve Kerr did when he took over the Golden State Warriors in 2014, when he lamented the \u201cplays of insanity\u201d by his young guards, primarily Stephen Curry, which produced unforced turnovers. Now, the fact is, someone\u2019s kids will play well, and come through, and be a big part of a long postseason run. But whose? \u201cFirst, you\u2019ve got to make it,\u201d said Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who has seen both sides of the playoff divide, having sat on Boston\u2019s bench when the Kevin Garnett\/Paul Pierce\/Ray Allen team of tough-minded vets won The Finals in 2008 , and then coaching a painfully young Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah and their teammates through a long playoff run two seasons later . \u201cIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to make it, you understand that there\u2019s another intensity level when you get to the playoffs,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cThis is what you play for. If you love competition, this brings out the best in you.\u201d Towns loves competition. But he hasn\u2019t experienced it for himself yet. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fight,\u201d he said. \u201cOne play throughout the game can change the whole course of it. It\u2019s a feeling of trying to be perfect. You\u2019ve got to be perfect. You have to go out there and try your best, but you can\u2019t make those simple mistakes you make in the regular season and be able to get away with it. It\u2019s a different philosophy \u2026 the playoffs is a different animal. The biggest thing in the playoffs is who\u2019s the first team to switch up their game plan.\u201d But nothing does like doing. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d said Washington Wizards All-Star guard Bradley Beal, whose first postseason series came in 2014 against Chicago . \u201cWe had Sam Cassell, and Witt (former Coach Randy Wittman), and Nene was crazy. The level of play, the fierceness, the competitive edge that everybody had, they treated every game like it was a win or lose situation. Both teams. Every time I\u2019ve been in the playoffs it\u2019s been that way. It\u2019s nothing like the regular season.\u201d Washington is one of the few East teams that will bring a core with no first-timers to the postseason. The Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs and Warriors are similarly seeded throughout their rosters. But increasingly, those kinds of teams are the exception, not the rule. The Raptors may have the biggest postseason learning curve of any contender. Their young guys were in the lab all last summer \u2014 Siakam handling the ball, VanVleet and Wright working on their shooting. They have been crucial to Toronto\u2019s \u201cculture reset,\u201d as GM Masai Ujiri put it after his team was swept by Cleveland in the East semifinals last season . Their presence and production have cut the minutes of All-Stars Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, while also changing the iso style that the Raptors had maxed out at over the previous few years. None of them dominate the stat sheet \u2014 veteran C.J. Miles is tops off the bench in scoring, at 10.4 points per game in just under 19 minutes a night . But they all contribute. Some of Toronto\u2019s kids got a taste of things to come when they played on the team\u2019s G League team, Raptors 905, in the championship series last year, which it won over Rio Grande Valley in three games . \u201cIt was the first time for me being in a series situation; in college, it\u2019s one-and-done,\u201d said VanVleet, who got to the regional semis in the NCAA Tournament as a junior at Wichita State. \u201cI think I was thrown in there like, Game 2, of the three games of The Finals. Pascal played the whole playoffs. But just being thrown in a championship environment, it\u2019s big. It\u2019s not the same type of feel like a March Madness, but it\u2019s the same kind of intensity in terms of you want to get the job done in a playoff series. I think we were down 0-1 at the time, and try to come back and win the next two. It was just good experience getting under your belt, and you hope it can continue this year.\u201d Again, Miles is a big part of the Raptors\u2019 reserves. But VanVleet, Siakam, Poeltl and Wright have helped make Toronto\u2019s unit into one of the league most potent benches. They\u2019re first in the league in Defensive Rating (100.7) and steals per game (4.0) and third in made 3-pointers per game (4.9). When they\u2019re done, Lowry and DeRozan often are, too. \u201cIt was a crazy stretch, seven or eight games, where they didn\u2019t get to play the fourth quarter,\u201d Van Vleet said. \u201cThat was big for us, and for our team, keeping those guys fresh down the stretch. There\u2019s times where it\u2019ll be the second quarter. DeMar usually comes in with six or seven minutes left. It\u2019ll be all the way down to three or four before he checks back in. Those guys have been great, being unselfish, letting us kind of rock out when it\u2019s going good, and when it\u2019s not going good, all right, let\u2019s get back in there and settle this thing down. It\u2019s a good balance of both. But we\u2019ve got the utmost trust from our vets, and obviously from the coaching staff.\u201d The hard lessons the playoffs usually teach will be merciless. But those who survive it can often conquer it. Dennis Johnson went 0-for-14 in Game 7 of the 1978 Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics . The following year, he averaged 20.9 points and helped lead the Sonics to their only NBA title before repeating the feat twice more for Boston in \u201884 and \u201886. You only become a great playoff performer by getting there, and then getting back, again and again. \u201cI used to have a coach when I was younger who told me if you\u2019re not nervous in these types of situations, you\u2019re not ready to play,\u201d Beal said. \u201cFor me, it was getting my feet wet. After the first couple of minutes, you get used to it. It\u2019s like, okay, this is what it\u2019s about, this is what you have to do, this is how hard you have to play. And it just kind of takes off from there.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Benson, the longtime owner of the NFL\u2019s New Orleans Saints, died last week at 90 , leaving control of both the Saints and Pelicans, which he bought from the NBA in 2012, to his wife, Gayle. Gayle Benson has already been approved by the NBA as her husband\u2019s successor when it comes to making decisions concerning the franchise. Tom Benson had long planned to leave the Saints and Pelicans to Gayle Benson, whom he married in 2004. His plan survived a lawsuit filed by a daughter from his first marriage , Renee, and her two children in 2015, claiming Tom Benson did not have the mental capacity to decide to leave his franchises to Gayle Benson, his third wife. He had originally planned to leave the teams to his granddaughter, Rita, but changed his mind and his will. A judge ruled that year in Tom Benson\u2019s favor . A final legal battle within the family to determine the value of the shares of the Saints and Pelicans that Tom Benson wanted to remove from his family\u2019s trusts was settled in 2017 . So Gayle Benson was in place to assume her husband\u2019s role as owner of his sports teams when he died. \u201cAs we mourn the loss of Tom Benson,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Friday, \u201cwe know the New Orleans Pelicans are on strong and stable footing as Gayle Benson, currently the team\u2019s Alternate Governor, assumes control of the franchise.\u201d Gayle Benson addressed the team soon after her husband\u2019s death last week, and \u201cbasically said that everything will remain the same,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said Sunday. \u201cEverything is stable and in place.\u201d This is a crucial season for the Pelicans, with All-Star Anthony Davis trying to carry the team across the finish line and to the playoffs for the first time since 2014 . His task was made harder when his fellow All-Star, center DeMarcus Cousins, went down for the season in January after tearing his Achilles\u2019 in a win against the Houston Rockets . Cousins is an unrestricted free agent after this season and could have \u2014 at least before the injury \u2014 signed a five-year max deal starting next season for around $175 million. With Davis already on a $145 million max deal and guard Jrue Holiday just starting his $126 million contract this year, the team is essentially hard-capped this season. The Pelicans have gone about as far as they can go in outlay. (Despite that, New Orleans had enough roster flexibility to acquire Nikola Mirotic before the trade deadline .) All that led to speculation that Gayle Benson may want to sell one or both of the franchises soon. The Pelicans are one of just three teams \u2013 the Denver Nuggets and Portland Trail Blazers are the others \u2014 with no concrete plans to launch a G League franchise in the near future. GM Dell Demps said in a radio interview earlier this month that the team has put existing discussions for the G League \u201con pause\u201d after it looked like the Pelicans were working toward a deal with Pensacola, Fla., to house a G League affiliate. But a source who worked directly with Tom Benson during his purchase of the Pelicans said over the weekend that there was no doubt that Gayle Benson would keep both teams for the foreseeable future. \u201cThere may be some changes later, but nothing imminent or early,\u201d the source said. And any notion of the Pelicans moving any time soon is tempered by the reality that the Pels, thanks to the league\u2019s revenue sharing plan, don\u2019t really have much financial incentive to sell. New Orleans was one of 14 teams that reportedly lost money in the 2016-17 season, according to a report by ESPN.com last September . But after receiving its cut of revenue-sharing dollars from the league\u2019s higher-revenue franchises, New Orleans was no longer in the red. (The team also got a boost in its local TV ratings last season. According to Forbes, the Pelicans had the fifth-biggest year-over-year increase in local television ratings in the league, 17 percent, drawing an average 1.44 rating on FS New Orleans.) That is important, for the Pelicans are often among the first teams thought of these days as a potential move target. Seattle is moving quickly toward securing an expansion NHL franchise and working with the newly formed Oak View Group to renovate Key Arena for both NHL and NBA teams. That means the hunt for potential existing franchises to move to the Emerald City could accelerate in intensity in the next few years, especially with NBA expansion unlikely any time soon.  The Pelicans\u2019 lease at Smoothie King Center runs through 2024, though. And if Gayle Benson isn\u2019t looking for a quick flip of the franchise, the likelihood of anything happening, at the very least, before then appears remote. And the NBA has gone to great lengths to ensure the stability and viability of a franchise in New Orleans since the then-Hornets moved there from Charlotte in 2002. The franchise\u2019s history with the city and state has been one of deal making that has helped the franchise remain economically viable as it fights for audience share locally \u2014 the Pelicans are currently 25th in the league in attendance, per ESPN.com , at 16,418 per game. The NFL\u2019s Saints, which Benson also owned, are the clear top dog in town for fans\u2019 affections, but they had a 35-year head start on the basketball team. The state spent an initial $10 million to renovate what was then known as New Orleans Arena as a condition of the move from Charlotte. After Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 and badly damaged the arena, the NBA arranged for the team to play in Oklahoma City for two seasons, but never once considered leaving the franchise there. Former NBA Commissioner David Stern was adamant that the team not only return to New Orleans after repairs to the arena be made, but also worked to bring the 2008 All-Star Game there. (The 2017 All-Star Game was also awarded to New Orleans after the NBA took the game from Charlotte, where it was initially supposed to be played, in the wake of the North Carolina General Assembly\u2019s passage of the controversial HB2 \u201cBathroom Bill.\u201d ) Smoothie King Center is owned by the state of Louisiana and is operated by SMG, the arena management company. SMG also runs the Mercedes Benz Superdome that houses the Saints. They get a base fee from the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, the state entity that owns the arena, as well as additional fees from non-NBA and NFL events at Smoothie King and the Superdome. Then, famously (or, infamously, depending on the Laker fan with whom you speak), the NBA bought the team from former owners George Shinn and Gary Chouest in 2010 for $300 million, keeping it from being sold to out-of-state owners while the league sought local ownership. (It was during the league\u2019s ownership of the team that Stern, acting as the team\u2019s de facto final decision maker while the league owned the team, vetoed a proposed three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul from the then-Hornets to the Lakers .) Benson bought the team from the league for $338 million in 2012, ensuring that it would remain in New Orleans for the foreseeable future. He may not have been the only prospective owner for the Pelicans, but another source directly involved in the sale then said that Benson was the perfect prospective owner \u2014 \u201cgiven the proximity of the Arena and the Dome and the proficiency of the business operations that were already functioning,\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd he was a good owner, willing to commit resources to the team and the building (including a great new practice facility).\u201d The team then got a $50 million subsidy from the state, and was allowed to continue receiving an annual $3.5 million tax break, in a deal with the state in 2012 that extended the Pelicans\u2019 lease with the arena through 2024. The Pelicans reportedly received $40 million in naming rights from Smoothie King in 2014 , further monetizing the building. And the building has gotten good marks in fan surveys, ranking in the top 10 among all NBA arenas in overall satisfaction with the game experience. Attendance this season at Smoothie King Arena is holding steady from last year, when the Pelicans were 24th in the league in average attendance. The hope in the Big Easy is that Davis can lead the Pelicans to at least two additional home games there in April. After routing Boston Sunday night, New Orleans is in sixth place in the Western Conference , tied record-wise with fifth-place Utah and seventh-place San Antonio at 40-30. Davis has been sensational in Cousins\u2019 absence: since the All-Star break, he is averaging 30.8 points per game on 51.1 percent shooting, 11.8 rebounds and an insane 3.6 blocks per game. Davis casts a long shadow over the New Orleans sports world and perhaps only Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who won a Super Bowl there in 2010 , has more cache. Yet Tom Benson was the boss of both. His absence creates a void in the city that will be filled, one way or another \u2014 by continued great feats by great players, or by silence if they\u2019re no longer in town. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

He expressed an equal amount of faith in his ability to heal in time. \u201cI can\u2019t give you the exact date, but I want to come back and I want to help,\u201d said Butler, who sat courtside during the 129-120 loss Sunday to the Rockets in his first appearance on the bench since he was hurt. Wearing a black sport coat with, yes, gray sweatpants, Butler was on his feet often to shout encouragement to his teammates and even did some dancing during a timeout down the stretch when the Wolves had pulled within five points during their spirited comeback. The defeat, though, dropped them into eighth place in the Western Conference with a game Tuesday against the ninth-place Los Angeles Clippers. \u201cI have a little bit of time left, but I know my guys are going to stick this thing out and do what they\u2019ve been doing, keep us in this race,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAnd when I come back, we\u2019ll see what we have left in the tank.\u201d Butler has been able to do some running and shooting, with what he called an important week ahead in the rehab process. \u201cI just want to play. I feel like I\u2019ve done this long enough to know that I can still go out there and make something happen,\u201d Butler said. \u201cNow, I promise you I\u2019ll be out of shape. I promise you that. But just getting out there and getting back in a rhythm of things, that\u2019s going to come natural.\u201d The affable four-time All-Star, whose arrival before the season has not only lifted the Wolves offensively and defensively but given them a needed dose of tenacity, acknowledged that his knee felt worn down in the weeks leading up to the injury. He\u2019s averaging 37.1 minutes in 56 games, the second-most in the NBA. \u201cI can\u2019t say I know it was coming, but I knew that my knee was sore. Hints, things that happened, before I went down,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverybody had something to say about it, but like I said before, I know my body better than anybody.\u201d Would he have preferred to reduce his workload, in hindsight? No. \u201cYou have to risk it for the biscuit,\u201d Butler said, \u201cand that\u2019s what I\u2019m about. I\u2019m not one to sit out if I can play. I want to compete, to show that I\u2019m one of the better players to do this. I\u2019m here for a reason. I want to help my team win.\u201d The Wolves are 4-5 since Butler went out. \u201cNever nervous,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI\u2019m confident when I\u2019m out there on the floor with those guys. When I\u2019m not, I\u2019m still confident. I know what they\u2019re capable of. I know how everybody wants to do great things, how they want to see this organization in the playoffs, and they\u2019re going to do everything in their will and their power to make it happen.\u201d p."},{"id":47841,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-activate-soloman-hill","date":"2018-03-18","title":"New Orleans Pelicans activate Solomon Hill for first time this season","content":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans say forward Solomon Hill is available to play for the first time this season against the Boston Celtics on Sunday night.

From Matthew Agnew: Any chance the Raptors formula becomes the trendy new NBA team model of two pretty good players with a major focus on an unselfish, well-oiled second unit? I could see this replacing the super team as it\u2019s easier for struggling teams to adopt, instead of hoping for landing a LeBron or \u201cThe Brow\u201d in free agency. It\u2019s a copycat league, Matthew, so if the Raptors win the title this season or make the Finals, sure. Their reserves have been outstanding this season. But I think that\u2019s where most teams already are when it comes to roster building. Most of the league is never going to be in a position to realistically go after a LeBron or Kevin Durant when\/if they hit free agency, anyway. The Colossus of the Wasatch. From Travis Stevens: Utah\u2019s been on an absolute tear recently, winning 21 of its last 23. While Donovan Mitchell is getting a lot of attention for his phenomenal rookie campaign, the catalyst for the run was Rudy Gobert\u2019s return from injury. Since he came back, the Jazz have the most stifling defense in the league by a long way ( Defensive Rating of 98.7 since Jan. 1 ), which has pushed them into (arguably) the greatest mid-season turnaround in modern NBA history . Why, then, is Gobert only mentioned on the periphery of the Kia Defensive Player of the Year race? Who are you asking\/reading, Travis? Gobert is right at the top of the list for DPOY, as he was last year and the year before that, and as I suspect he will be for another 2-4 years. The only question with the Stifle Tower is the two lengthy stints he missed with his knee injuries; because of those, he can only max out at 56 games played this season if he posts for every remaining Jazz game. And some voters may \u2014 may \u2014 take that stretch of games missed into consideration when casting their votes. But in terms of understanding Rudy\u2019s significant defensive impact every time he steps out on the court, trust me \u2014 those of us who are paying attention understand how good he is. Not Stanning for Stan. From Albertis McCray: \u201cRuined\u201d is a bit strong; don\u2019t you think? He took a shot. Where, exactly, where the Pistons going before the trade? It doesn\u2019t look good now but let\u2019s at least give Griffin a full training camp with this team before passing final judgment. And I\u2019d be surprised if they move Drummond; he\u2019s a favorite of owner Tom Gores. I mean, Drummond could do the exact same things for a contending team that Clint Capela does for the Houston Rockets, right? So the problem isn\u2019t him; it\u2019s the rest of the Pistons. They\u2019re not, in my view, good enough. And that\u2019s on SVG, as is dealing Tobias Harris and your first for Griffin. Still wouldn\u2019t use \u201cruined,\u201d though. Tip of the Cap. From Jon Kueper: Thanks, Jon. I don\u2019t expect or want (really) people to agree with my all of my opinions. I can learn a lot from people with whom I disagree about things, as long as they come with facts and respect instead of invective and cursing. I truly respect those who genuinely have Second Amendment reasons for opposing most\/all gun legislation or increased regulations or laws that would make it harder to buy them. I just disagree. Reasonable people do, every day. This is Because He Never Watched \u201cFuturama.\u201d From Rick Belle Isle: Like Nostradamus, Chuck has been known to fall in love with talent over chemistry.

Under the buy\/sell provision, the Grizzlies\u2019 current owner, Robert Pera, now has the option of either buying Kaplan and Straus, two of the team\u2019s limited partners, at that estimated price, or selling the team to them at that price. 19 \u2014 Consecutive losses for the Grizzlies before they ended their streak with an unlikely victory Saturday against the Nuggets . Memphis hadn\u2019t won a game since Jan. 29, which was so long ago the Winter Olympics hadn\u2019t even started yet. Memphis\u2019 streak wound up tying for the 13th-worst in league history, still nine games short of the all-time record, 28, set by the 76ers over two seasons (March, 2015-December, 2015). 121 \u2014 Rebounds needed, in the last 10 games, by Russell Westbrook to average a triple-double for a second consecutive season. After posting his fifth consecutive triple-double in a well-earned road win at red-hot Toronto Sunday, Westbrook is averaging 25.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists this season. OKC is now 84-18 in games where Westbrook gets a triple double. 1 ) When we were both much younger, I covered Jeff Bzdelik , now the architect of the Rockets\u2019 much-improved defense as Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s top assistant, when he had just gotten the coaching job at UMBC, which had just gone Division I in the late 1980s. That night, UMBC lost by about seven zillion to Georgetown. The idea that the Retrievers would someday pull off the greatest upset in college basketball history was not worth wasting valuable brain cells in contemplation. But it\u2019s why we love sports. Things like that can, and do, happen. 1A) And, love this dude . 1B) And, thank you, Jim Boeheim, for fouling when up three. Every time. 2) The Lakers will not make the playoffs this season, but they\u2019re definitely going in the right direction, finally. Not sure if it\u2019s for real or not \u2014 Isaiah Thomas won\u2019t be there next season unless something goes wrong in the recruit game this summer, and Julius Randle may be pricing himself out of their range. But winning is never bad for young players to experience, no matter how it occurs. 3) Happy 1,000th Episode, Starters! I love anyone who loves hoop as much as you guys do. 1) That was a bad loss to Memphis, Nuggets. 2) Alvin Gentry may have been self-serving sticking up for Anthony Davis , but it doesn\u2019t mean he was wrong, at least about one thing. As the pro game has gone smaller and smaller, teams just put guards and wings on big men, knowing that refs seem to let smaller guys get away with a little more when they\u2019re trying to guard bigger guys. But if you do that, you\u2019re penalizing a great player like Davis who can\u2019t be guarded legally by almost any smaller defender. (Maybe P.J. Tucker.) 3) RIP, Henry Williams , the former UNC-Charlotte great and Charlotte Bobcats analyst , who passed last week after a long battle with kidney disease. By all accounts, he was a class person, on and off the court. 4) Guard. The Inbounds. Pass. Coaches rail all the time about their players allowing straight line drives to the basket, but they still allow straight-line passes for game-tying or game-losing opponent threes. Don\u2019t get it. 5) We were all Toys \u2018R Us kids .

It goes against competition. To me, that\u2019s cheating the fans. You give 100 percent all the time. That\u2019s just my personal opinion.\u201d Sam Worthen is the coach of the Washington Generals. Not familiar with the Washington Generals? If you\u2019ve heard of the Harlem Globetrotters, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard of the Generals. They are the Globetrotters\u2019 perennial sparring partners, sad-sack straight men to basketball\u2019s crown princes of comedy. Only Wile E. Coyote has a longer losing streak against a single opponent, the Road Runner, than the Generals. They have lost somewhere between 14,000 and 17,000 times to the barnstorming Globetrotters since the Washington team was established in 1952 as regular, reliable fall guys. Look up \u201chapless\u201d in the dictionary and you\u2019ll see a sketch of Louis (Red) Klotz, Generals founder and longtime player\/coach, and his band of plucky but perpetually humbled teammates. The Generals have done business under a variety of aliases through the years \u2014 the Boston Shamrocks, the New Jersey Reds, the New York Nationals, International Elite, Global Select and the World All-Stars all have been pseudonyms \u2014 while achieving a remarkable consistency of results. In other words, if any basketball team has thrived with a strategy of winning-by-losing \u2014 as some NBA teams attempt to do each spring \u2014 it\u2019s the Generals. They have done their duty thousands of times over, sending fans of the clever Trotters home happy time and time again. Allegedly, that formula is about to change. \u201cIn the past, the Generals got so used to losing,\u201d Worthen said. \u201cThey had a lack of talent and poor coaching. Now we\u2019re changing everything around. We have [TNT NBA studio analyst] Kenny Smith as the general manager and myself as coach. \u201cWe took three years off for planning and preparation for how to beat the Globetrotters. We did a lot of scouting, Kenny and I, watching all kinds of tapes, looking at the Globetrotters\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. And we recruited a bunch of guys with special talents who believe they can win.\u201d Worthen was on the telephone, but you could almost hear in the background the sabers he was rattling. Between some telltale chuckles. \u201cIn the past, the Generals had guys who didn\u2019t think they could win. They were just \u2018out there.\u2019 The fans will notice this, because when we put the product on the court, they will see the talent we have.\u201d It sounded like a preseason spiel, but the Generals have been putting the product on the court since December, when the Globetrotters\u2019 2018 \u201cAmazing Feats of Basketball World Tour\u201d began. The groundwork Smith and Worthen put in during Washington\u2019s hiatus \u2014 Smith, by the way, declined to be interviewed for this piece, perhaps unable to keep his tongue firmly in cheek \u2014 began last summer. That\u2019s when a Generals entry competed in The Basketball Tournament , the winner-take-all, $2 million event. Worthen\u2019s squad did well playing the game seriously, but still lost in the first round to the Matadors , a team featuring former players from Texas Tech. The Generals had former NBA player Sundiata Gaines on their side then \u2014 he logged 113 NBA games from 2009-12 with the Utah Jazz, Minnesota Timberwolves, Toronto Raptors and New Jersey Nets. Their stars these days include guards Trey Bardsley and Shaquille Burrell and forward Aquill Baynard. \u201cIn the past, you didn\u2019t see anything like these guys on the Generals,\u201d Worthen said. \u201cKenny and I always have our eyes open, looking for talent. \u201cWe\u2019re bigger, we\u2019re faster and we\u2019re better than ever. [The TBT] was our heads-up to the Globetrotters. They know that we\u2019re up and coming.\u201d As for Worthen, 60, he earned his chops at all levels of basketball over a lifetime spent in the game. A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., he starred at Franklin K. Lane High, spent two seasons at McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas, then played at Marquette from 1978-80. He was sporting a shaved head before Michael Jordan made it cool, dishing no-look passes worthy of Magic Johnson and averaging a triple-double at McLennan before Russell Westbrook was born. In fact, Worthen gained much of his hoops reputation on asphalt, playing for longtime NBA writer Peter Vecsey\u2019s squads in New York\u2019s renowned Rucker Tournament. Still, he and Marquette coach Hank Raymonds carved out a working relationship. They helped Marquette to a combined 40-16 record and two NCAA tournament berths. At the end of his senior season, he was drafted in the second round of the 1980 Draft by the Bulls. Worthen spent one season with Chicago and another with Utah , averging 3.5 points, 1.7 assists and 14.0 minutes in a total of 69 appearances. Then came playing, winning and later coaching in the United States Basketball League, with teams in Connecticut and Florida (where NBA legend World B. Free was a teammate briefly). Shifting into coaching full-time in Puerto Rico\u2019s professional Baloncesto Superior Nacional, Worthen worked for \u201cseven or eight teams in 10 seasons,\u201d he said. In between, Worthen returned each year to New York, where he worked on projects with the state and the city in youth basketball. He was an assistant to Jeff Capel Jr. for three seasons (2001-04) with the Fayetteville Patriots in the NBA G League and part of Jeff Ruland\u2019s staff at Iona College (2004-07). Then he hooked up with the Generals, even before their reset. Obviously, Worthen\u2019s coaching record has tilted toward the L\u2019s since accepting the role as the Globetrotters\u2019 regular punching bag. \u201cThe only column we look at is on the left-hand side,\u201d Worthen said. \u201cThen when we get that digit for the left-hand side, yeah, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. \u201cThe last time we had to use some ink in that column was January 5, 1971. That was in Martin, Tennessee, when the Generals beat the Globetrotters, 100-99.\u201d It\u2019s true. Forty-seven years ago, the Globetrotters were playing without their dribbling magician Curly Neal and the Generals were unusually competent. The headliners clawed back from a 12-point deficit to lead by a point with second remaining. That\u2019s when Klotz threw up a set shot that banged in. After Globetrotters star Meadowlark Lemon failed several times, with a couple of clock resets, to hit a hook shot, the Generals officially snagged their rare victory . \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking forward to again. It\u2019s coming,\u201d Worthen said. \u201cLike they say, they\u2019re the best team in the world. So once we beat them, we become the best team in the world. \u201cThe toughest thing is staying up all night, watching tapes, breaking down video to see what we can do.\u201d So Worthen feels that the Generals are getting close to beating their nemesis\/meal tickets? \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say that necessarily,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut our main, No. 1 goal is to come up with that victory. We\u2019ve been working really hard on it.\u201d Surely that would generate headlines, snapping a losing streak that\u2019s 47 years old now. Worthen just chuckled some more. There is no compelling reason to tinker with the script. The Globetrotters draw the crowds, provide the schtick and dazzle just enough with dunks, crafty passes and circus shots to maintain their court cred. The Generals are there to suggest resistance, but the defensive intensity typically is on par with some past NBA All-Star Games. The Generals don\u2019t lack for opportunities to win. There are three squads of them, synched up with three squads of Globetrotters that divide their tours along the East Coast, in western and southern states, and internationally. On Friday, for instance, \u201cthe Globetrotters\u201d were scheduled for games in Loveland, Colo., Reading, Pa., and Bordeaux, France. Combined, they play about 400 games per five-month season. Worthen and his wife, Florine, live in the Bronx and have adjusted to having few or no home games. Never mind that \u201cWashington\u201d tag \u2014 Worthen\u2019s life is spent largely on the road, without NBA-level charter flights or per-diem pocket money. The grueling schedule and breakneck travel suggests the Generals and the Globetrotters don\u2019t exactly have NBA commissioner Adam Silver in their corner on the modern issue of rest. They routinely have days when they play both a matinee and, scurrying to another city, an evening game. \u201cYes, doubleheaders,\u201d Worthen said. There would be a strike in the NBA if the league tried to schedule those, Worthen was told. \u201cHow \u2018bout that? Yeah,\u201d he said, laughing again. \u201cAnd I love every bit of it.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Book it. With the top dog distancing himself even more, the only race remaining is for runner-up honors, which appears to be a three-man chase. After just missing the cut in his inaugural OSPR showing, a certain enigmatic point guard in New Orleans finds himself in the race. Also take note of who\u2019ll be joining the 32-and-older club later this month. That could make things interesting. 1. LeBron James (33), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 29.6 ppg, 10.1 rpg, 8.9 apg Season stats: 27.0 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 9.0 apg No matter which stats you look at, they\u2019re all impressive: 25 or more points in nine of the last 10 games, double-digit rebounds in four straight, double-digit assists in four of the last nine and better than 50 percent from the field in five of the last six. James is absolutely right when he says he\u2019s like a fine wine that gets better with age . 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 19.4 ppg, 9.2 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 22.2 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 2.0 apg Because of knee\/ankle issues over the couple of weeks, Aldridge\u2019s grip on the No. 2 spot is weakening. The Spurs big man started the two-week stint by missing the March 3 game with a sprained ankle. He then played three games (scoring 30 in one) before missing another game with a sore knee. On a positive note, he\u2019s gone for 24 and 25 in the last two games. 3. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 21.4 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 1.0 apg Season stats: 16.5 ppg, 12.1 rpg, 1.3 apg It looked like Howard would slip a couple spots when he began the stint with six points on March 2 and 10 points on March 4. But he rebounded nicely, turning in three 30-point games over the next five. Over the seven games, Howard shot a blistering 63.6 from the field to go along with 2.3 blocks. That was more than enough to leap over Paul. 4. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 17.6 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 7.1 apg Season stats: 18.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 8.0 apg Ho-hum is probably the best way to describe Paul\u2019s last seven games. He did manage to score 15 or more in five of the seven, but broke 20 just twice. He also dished out double-digit assists just twice while managing two games with just three dimes. Paul did, however, shoot a respectible 45.7 from the field. 5. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 18.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 5.5 apg Season stats: 17.8 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 4.1 apg It was a typical six games for Gasol, who in addition to going for 20 or more points in three games also snatched double-digit rebounds three times. In fact, his only stinker was a nine-point, 11-rebound effort March 9 against Utah. Other than that, Gasol managed at least 17 points and six rebounds in all. 6. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 16.1 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 2.1 apg Season stats: 16.6 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 3.1 apg We pretty know what we\u2019re going to get with Redick: 17-20 points a night and not much in the way of rebounds or assists. Well, Redick certainly stayed true to form in the last seven games, going for 16-18 points in five of seven. He also didn\u2019t manage more than three rebounds or five assists in any one game. 7. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 7 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 15.0 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 14.9 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 2.1 apg The big man continues to plug away, averaging a surprising 25.8 minutes while starting 56 of 57 games. Of course like most players, he\u2019s more comfortable and effective at home. In his last three games, Randolph averaged 17.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 44.7 from the field. In his last two road games, he averaged 11.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 34.4 from the field. 8. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 15.3 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 0.8 apg Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.3 apg OK, we\u2019ll choose not to talk about the shooting (we can see the numbers). Anthony has gotten into a bit of a groove from deep, hitting at least three 3-pointers in four of his last five (43.9 percent). He\u2019s also gone for 20 or more points in three of his last five. So why didn\u2019t he move up? Because of last Saturday\u2019s two-point performance on 1-for-7 shooting. 9. Rajon Rondo (32), New Orleans Pelicans Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 9.4 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 8.6 apg Season stats: 7.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 7.7 apg We\u2019ll be perfectly honest: Rondo basically made the cut on the strength of one game \u2014 a 12-point, 17-assist showing against the Hornets. Other than that, he had one just above-average performance (14 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists) coupled with three games in which he failed to score more than six points. 10. Dirk Nowitzki (39), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 14.3 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.2 apg Season stats: 12.4 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Nowitzki started the two-week stint in solid form, going for 18, 23 and 17 points. Unfortunately, he tailed off a bit, going for 13 or less in the next three games. But the big German shot well (48.4 FG% and 44.7 3PT%), connecting on three or more 3s in four of the six games. Just missed the cut: Dwyane Wade, Kyle Korver, J.J. Barea, Trevor Ariza Will turn 32 this season:  Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Actually, that idea had come from long-time Texas equipment manager Rob Lazare, who had sage advice for the youngster. \u201cHe said, \u2018guys never leave their colleges saying I wish coach wasn\u2019t so hard on me,\u2019 \u201d Bamba said. \u201cInstead, they leave saying \u2018I wish coach was on me harder. I could have worked so much harder and gotten so much better.\u2019 \u201d Bamba wasn\u2019t about to let what he and every NBA general manager knew would be his only college season get past him without deriving maximum benefit. \u201cAt first, coach Smart was big on not overwhelming me,\u201d Bamba said. \u201cBut I told him my mental capacity is a lot more than you think it is. I can take it.\u201d You\u2019d have to know Bamba \u2014 and after one conversation you realize quickly that he\u2019s got as much going on between his ears as he does physically \u2014 to realize that wasn\u2019t some idle boast. He was ready for whatever Smart wanted to send his way. Soon, Bamba was watching more film than a movie critic as he and Smart studied, sometimes frame-by-frame, his weaknesses. But Smart is unfailingly positive, so he made sure to show Bamba what he was doing right. Bamba had played those first 10 games much better than he thought, averaging 10.3 points and 9.7 rebounds per game. But there was room for improvement, as his 47.6 percent field-goal percentage and 57.9 free-throw percentage underscored. After Bamba and Smart began their film sessions, Bamba\u2019s averages improved to 14.3 ppg, 10.8 rpg and 3.5 bpg. He shot 57.1 percent overall, 72.5 percent from the free-throw line and collected 11 double-doubles. \u201cThose first few games, he was obviously trying to learn the speed of things, the game itself,\u201d said Texas junior Dylan Osetkowski. \u201cThe jump he\u2019s made from pre-conference to Big 12, and from Big 12 to now [the NCAA Tournament], has been incredible. I\u2019m talking about his game, his mindset. It just comes to him now. He doesn\u2019t have to find it.\u201d The rest of the Big 12 figured that out quickly as Bamba was wreaking havoc on both ends of the floor. He led the conference with 14 double-doubles and was also tops in the league and second in the nation in blocked shots (108, 3.7 bpg). Eight of those blocks \u2014 a Texas freshman record \u2014 came against mighty Kansas. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v \u201cHe\u2019s as good as anybody I\u2019ve been around or coached against regularly,\u201d said Texas assistant coach Darrin Horn, a former coach at Western Kentucky and South Carolina. \u201cThat would include Anthony Davis [Kentucky\u2019s 2012 national player of the year] and those kinds of guys. He\u2019s a really unique guy in terms of what he can do physically. With his length, he can sit down and move his hips and defend as well. It allows him to do so much on both ends.\u201d Horn doesn\u2019t think Bamba, who\u2019s a bit on the lean side, should be typecast as a shot blocker. Horn cites Bamba\u2019s ability to make the occasional 3-pointer and put the ball on the floor, but raves about his passing prowess \u2014 especially when he\u2019s facing double teams. \u201cI think he has a chance to be a really good offensive player at the next level,\u201d Horn said. \u201cSome of it he can\u2019t do here, because there\u2019s not enough space on the floor, whether it\u2019s a ton of zone, or people sitting in his lap. The way they come at him, it\u2019s hard to iso him. \u201cI think he can be really good at the elbow, kind of Kevin Garnett style, whether it\u2019s an elbow jumper or putting it down for a dribble or two to make a move off that. He\u2019s got ability and feel to do all that. He\u2019s maybe not polished enough quite yet, and right now there\u2019s not enough space. But one day, he\u2019s going to be able to do all that at the next level.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v With that incredible wingspan of his, Bamba is also a great rebounder, in or out of his area. \u201cHe\u2019s as good a defensive rebounder as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Texas assistant Mike Morrell said. \u201cAnd his numbers suggest that as well. He\u2019s got really good hands. He moves well. He\u2019s stronger and sturdier than he gets credit for. He can go get it at the top and grab the ball at its peak. He\u2019s a one percent or even less in terms of that.\u201d Bamba tops off the package with a maturity beyond his years. Asked to pick out his young teammate\u2019s strength. Osetkowski didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSomething not everybody will say is his maturity level,\u201d Osetkowski said. \u201cHis ability to take in coaching, criticism, whether it\u2019s positive or negative. His ability to really work with that. That bodes well for him at the next level. It gives him the opportunity to take what his coaches and other players tell him and run with it.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, guard Marcus Smart is going to have surgery today to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb. Smart missed the Celtics\u2019 last game because of the injury. Per Wojnarowski, the Celtics are hopeful he will be able to return at some point in the postseason : In late January, Smart suffered a cut to his right hand as the result of a self-inflicted injury. He punched a picture frame in his Los Angeles hotel room during the team\u2019s road trip, causing an gash on the hand that required stitches and for him to be out of the lineup. He returned to the lineup on Feb. 23 vs. Detroit and has played in every game since then. Then came Sunday, when Smart injured his right thumb again. Days ago, the length of Smart\u2019s absence from the lineup was undetermined as he was reportedly seeking second opinions on how to treat the injury. All-Star big man Al Horford will be back in the lineup for the Celtics tonight as they visit the Orlando Magic ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Celtics will still be without All-Star guard Kyrie Irving (knee) and second-year forward Jaylen Brown (concussion protocol) tonight, however. This morning, coach Brad Stevens said Irving is feeling a bit better today and that he will do a workout with the team at the arena. As for Brown, Stevens said, \u201cHis headache was resolved yesterday. There\u2019s a chance that he\u2019ll now start a physical part of the progression back. He will be reassessed early next week.\u201d In Wednesday\u2019s double-overtime loss to the Washington Wizards, the Celtics were down five players (Irving, Horford, Brown, Smart and center Daniel Theis). Despite being so shorthanded, the Celtics built a 20-point lead in that game before squandering it . Horford missed two games because of his illness while Brown has not played since suffering his concussion on March 8 vs. Minnesota . Smart missed the Wizards game with a right thumb sprain while Theis tore a ligament in his left knee and is out for the rest of the season ."},{"id":41324,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/will-oklahoma-city-thunder-turn-it-notch-playoffs","date":"2018-03-16","title":"After 70 games, unpredictability has been a consistent theme for Oklahoma City Thunder","content":" * Tonight on NBA TV:  Clippers vs. Thunder (8 ET) Russell Westbrook has reached 100 career triple-doubles,  third all-time , an appropriate number for someone who matches that in speed limit on the floor. It\u2019s quite an achievement, for sure, especially considering that, at 29, Westbrook is still in his prime. And as any player assigned to guard him can attest, there are no signs of him easing up. He also has a chance to average a triple-double for the second straight season if he outwrestles teammate Steven Adams for a few additional rebounds here in the final few weeks, which means Westbrook is virtually the same player who won the Kia MVP a year ago. But what\u2019s also the same is Oklahoma City. Westbrook\u2019s team is on pace to duplicate the same number of wins (47) as last season and also where it sits in the Western Conference standings and, perhaps, the same out-in-the-first-round playoff finish. That, more than Russ\u2019 triple-double fetish, is the story here. The offseason All-Star additions of Paul George and Carmelo Anthony haven\u2019t turned OKC into a super team or made a bump in terms of the bottom line, at least not yet, and time is hardly on the Thunder\u2019s side. Remember, this team is on the clock. The playoffs are fast approaching, and so is George\u2019s free agent decision on his future this summer. There\u2019s no question that those two are intertwined. Unless there\u2019s another gear that Oklahoma City hasn\u2019t shown after 70 inconsistent games, Westbrook might be staring at yet another remaking of his team this summer. If you\u2019ve lost count, it\u2019s at four right now. There was the Westbrook-Kevin Durant-James Harden Thunder, young talent on the rise, who reached the NBA Finals but eventually self-destructed when it was time to pony up and OKC got spooked by the luxury tax and Harden wanted his own team. Imagine: Assuming Harden gets the vote in his favor this year, that\u2019s three MVPs once on the same roster. There was the Westbrook-Durant Thunder, where the dynamic deuces carried the club to a string of great seasons, finally undone by untimely injuries and a collapse after leading Golden State 3-1 in the West finals and Durant\u2019s desire to join \u2018em after he couldn\u2019t beat \u2018em. The Westbrook-Victor Oladipo Thunder became purely a Westbrook vanity project, where Westbrook was free to roam and wreak havoc while poor Oladipo was, for the most part, a curious spectator and eventual trade chip to get George from Indiana (don\u2019t cry for Oladipo; he\u2019s doing OK now). And now it\u2019s down to this, Westbrook-George-Melo, a maddening project that too often gets caught in a fog against inferior teams while occasionally flexing the firepower that makes you wonder if they can be better in the playoffs than the regular season. Ask Westbrook about where the Thunder stand at this checkpoint of the season, and he\u2019s suspiciously non-committal: \u201cMan, we\u2019re just taking it one game at a time and see how far we can go. We know who we are and what we have and what we\u2019re capable of doing.\u201d That\u2019s not what Harden would say about the Rockets or Durant about the Warriors, although to be fair, those teams seem beyond the reach of the rest of the league, not just Oklahoma City. It\u2019s perhaps wise to hedge a bit anyway with the Thunder going forward, because the clues they\u2019ve left behind are all so perplexing. The pluses are obvious, starting with Westbrook. His only flaw this season is 3-point shooting, where he\u2019s under 30 percent. Otherwise, the energy is still there, as evident by his relentless rebounding; he\u2019s the only player under 6-foot-5 who\u2019s in the top 40 . And he\u2019s still finding teammates despite what his usage rate might suggest. He\u2019s only taking three fewer shots this season despite the addition of players who were No. 1 options on their previous teams, and that could be a nit-pick. Blame that on Westbrook\u2019s eternal belief that he can beat his man off the dribble or hit the pull-up jumper. He\u2019s often a victim of his supreme confidence in himself. Even Anthony, who\u2019s most affected by Westbrook\u2019s 21 shots a night, is impressed. \u201cWhat he\u2019s able to do on nightly basis, what it takes to do that, the focus you have to have, for me to be a part of that, be alongside him, it\u2019s special,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we all should appreciate what we have and who we have.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been an easy transition all around for Anthony. Leaving Manhattan for a sleepy Midwestern town that doesn\u2019t offer much after midnight has taken some adjusting, along with being away from his son, who still lives in New York. Yet it\u2019s the basketball side that finds Melo dealing with his mortality. When the season began, he chuckled at the thought of a reduced role or coming off the bench, and while he\u2019s still in the starting lineup, his role clearly has changed. It has hit him all at once: His surroundings, limitations and pecking order, and that\u2019s not easy for a star to swallow. This is the first time in memory that Melo hasn\u2019t been his team\u2019s lead singer, and this goes beyond 13 years in the NBA and his one year at Syracuse. Also, when he does have the ball, his freedom on the floor is different. Until now, Melo could do as he pleased, shoot from where he wanted. With OKC, in this system, he rarely posts up anymore, which means fewer free throw chances \u2014 he\u2019s taking just 2.6 per game , down from an average of seven during his Knicks days, although age (33) and surgery also plays a part. \u201cYou just have to accept what this team needs,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to accept that, although it took a while. Now the game is just coming to me. It\u2019s a different style than what I\u2019ve been used to but when we\u2019re playing like this and (Russ) is doing what he does and everyone playing their role, we\u2019re successful.\u201d The ball was constantly in Melo\u2019s hands for his entire basketball life and every offense he\u2019s been involved in ran through him. He dictated everything. Now? He\u2019s a spot-up shooter who, for the most part, waits for his cue from Westbrook. Coach Billy Donovan said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had different talks through the year about what we need from him to help our team, and he\u2019s been mature enough to go through that. Carmelo has been the best in this league for a long time at what he does, but obviously not everybody\u2019s going to get everything they had in the past. \u201cPaul doesn\u2019t have the ball as much as he did, Carmelo\u2019s not going to score as much as he did, same with Russell,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt speaks to their character about wanting to win that they\u2019re willing to figure out what can we do to try and come up with a way to play that\u2019s the best version of ourselves. All those guys had to take less. Winning\u2019s important to all of them.\u201d Winning in the playoffs could ultimately push George in one direction or another once he hits free agency in July. That\u2019s a lot of pressure awaiting the franchise next month. OKC lost to the Rockets in five games last April, although the Thunder\u2019s first-round matchup this time should be more favorable if they get the 4 or 5 seed. George still maintains that his belief in OKC\u2019s ability to win a title will factor heavily in whether he stays or leaves. \u201cWe just have to pick up the pace and keep it rolling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all coming together for us, we just have to keep it going.\u201d The remaining schedule isn\u2019t cooperating. The Thunder have only one game, the season finale against the Grizzlies, against a team that\u2019s not fighting for a playoff spot or seeding. That means Donovan probably won\u2019t have the luxury of resting any of his most important players, and that includes Adams, who\u2019s dealing with a bum ankle. Also, they\u2019re without Andre Roberson, their next-best defender after George, the rest of the way. With a strong regular season finish, OKC could get third place, behind the Warriors and Rockets, right where they were projected to be. Or, in the event of a struggle, which is also possible given their behavior pattern, they could be seventh or eighth and see either team. \u201cOne game at a time,\u201d said Westbrook. If nothing else, OKC is destined to get the usual from Westbrook, who surprisingly isn\u2019t in the conversation for MVP, yet could average a triple or close enough. That surprises the people around him. \u201cHe\u2019s engaged,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cIt speaks to his control of the game and how hard he plays. It\u2019s a heck of a milestone, getting 100 triple doubles. He doesn\u2019t have to take a shot to impact the game.\u201d Yet if Westbrook doesn\u2019t win a playoff round or two, he could be staring at another off-season of changes around him. Anthony isn\u2019t going anywhere because the $27 million he\u2019s due in his option year is more than anyone will pay. George has other avenues to explore, if he chooses. If George leaves, then there\u2019s a very real chance Westbrook will be a star on his own island for some time. That\u2019s because it\u2019s tough to get free agents to come to OKC, which is why GM Sam Presti has worked overtime trying to trade for help (Oladipo, George, Melo, etc.). Put aside for the moment the perception, true or not, that few would want to play next to Westbrook. Oklahoma City, in spite of its charms, isn\u2019t the type of place that\u2019s on radar for stars. OKC got Durant, Westbrook and Harden because they were drafted, and Westbrook stayed for 205 million reasons . Would Melo in his prime sign in OKC? LeBron? Anybody who\u2019s an A-list star? That\u2019s an issue for this offseason. Right now, all the promise that Westbrook, George and Melo generated in the preseason needs to make an appearance this spring, if that\u2019s possible. After 70 games, how many more games does the Oklahoma City Thunder need in order to show us they\u2019re better than what the record says they are?

Any rational observer of the league has paid attention to what he\u2019s done for the Houston Rockets this season has already concluded as much. Harden has created enough separation during the Rockets\u2019 magical run to distance himself from perhaps the deepest group of legitimate candidates in recent years. It\u2019s a group that includes four-time MVP winner LeBron James, two-time winner Stephen Curry, 2014 winner Kevin Durant and, perhaps most notably, reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook . The Oklahoma City Thunder superstar stormed to the MVP in 2016-17 on the strength of his historic season , becoming the first player since Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double . Westbrook\u2019s position on the edge of the debate this season, however, serves as the most compelling argument for this MVP race being one of the deepest in years. He collected his 100th career triple-double Tuesday in a win against the Atlanta Hawks and is is averaging a near triple-double (25.3 points, 10.2 assists and 9.6 rebounds) for the second straight season . Yet Westbrook probably won\u2019t finish in the top five of the MVP race this season. \u201cThat\u2019s not a knock on Russ, it\u2019s a testament to the health of the league right now,\u201d an Eastern Conference executive said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nod to all of these guys who are having unbelievable seasons. You can make rock-solid arguments for seven or eight guys right now, legitimate arguments, and the body of work would back it up. Usually there are three or four guys who separate from the pack. But this season the group is certainly twice as large.\u201d The Thunder, who host the LA Clippers tonight ( 8 ET, NBA TV ), are battling for a top-four spot in the Western Conference playoff chase and could finish with as good or better a record than their 47-35 finish last season. And Westbrook will likely still have trouble catching the crowd at the top of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, not that anyone who has to deal with Westbrook cares. He is every bit as difficult to deal with this season as a one-man storm, only now he has fellow All-Star Paul George and veteran Carmelo Anthony rocking with him. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer admitted as much after Westbrook worked his team over for the 32 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists that produced his 100th triple-double. \u201cWe really wanted to show him a crowd, show him a lot of bodies,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cAt times I thought we did a good job of it, I thought we were in the right spots and the right places. When Carmelo started hitting those three\u2019s, that hurts a lot, when he starts teeing them up. Then you feel a little less hesitant to show a crowd, and Westbrook\u2019s starting to get a little more penetration, getting more on the rim, getting to the free throw line more. That\u2019s why they\u2019re a good team. They start putting some shooting around him and he\u2019s such a force. A lot of the game, I thought we did a good job, as good as you can do on Westbrook.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 22 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  30.9 points, 8.7 assists, 5.2 rebounds How did Harden and the Rockets respond to having their 17-game win streak snapped in Toronto last week ? They started another one, which is up to three games after Thursday night\u2019s win against the LA Clippers . Harden put the game away with a late jumper, finishing with 24 points, seven assists and five rebounds as the Rockets tightened their grip on the top spot in the Western Conference standings. As impressive as the Rockets\u2019 current 20-1 run is, the 36-2 mark they have with Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela in the lineup is one of the more remarkable figures compiled in recent memory. Any concerns about the Rockets going hard now (instead of saving some of their juice for the playoffs) should be tempered by the fact their improved depth gives coach Mike D\u2019Antoni some flexability as the season wanes. That said, Houston won\u2019t be easing off the gas in the season\u2019s final month. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.0 points, 9.0 assists, 8.6 rebounds If these are the final days of LeBron\u2019s second stint with the Cavaliers, as some believe, he\u2019s going out with a bang. Or did you miss his turn-back-the-clock, Dunk-of-the-Year posterization of Jusuf Nurkic ? The Cavaliers finally knocked off a team that is .500 or better by topping Denver last Wednesday . Thursday night in Portland, however, will definitely be featured prominently on his highlight reel. Lost in all of the (deserved) hype from that moment is the Cavaliers once again came up short despite LeBron\u2019s best efforts ( 35 points, 14 rebounds, six assists, three blocks and two steals ). Granted, they were facing the NBA\u2019s hottest team (the Trail Blazers own the league\u2019s longest active win streak at 11) on their home court. Whatever the Cavaliers\u2019 fate is this season, you can rest assured it will include some of LeBron\u2019s finest work. And he hasn\u2019t been shy about acknowledging as much recently, since he\u2019s \u201caging like fine wine.\u201d The Cavaliers, however, are just 7-7 since last month\u2019s trade deadline and just 1-6 against .500 or better teams since All-Star weekend. They are struggling to the finish line of the regular season. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  26.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists You can add Durant\u2019s name to the long list of walking wounded the Warriors are marching with as the regular season winds down. All-Stars Stephen Curry (ankle) and Klay Thompson (thumb) are out of the lineup and Durant is dealing with rib soreness that could sideline him tonight against the Sacramento Kings ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Warriors, of course, are playing the long game. They need their stars as healthy as possible for the playoffs. This current spate of injuries is adversity they\u2019ve dealt with before, albeit in smaller doses. But the Warriors, as coach Steve Kerr indicated after his patched-together bunch practiced Thursday, are dealing with the adversity that comes with trying to conquer the Western Conference for a fourth straight season. Having Durant available while Curry was out was a saving grace, though. And how many teams can lose a two-time Kia MVP to injury and still lean on another former MVP and Finals MVP? But things will get a bit choppy for the champs if Durant (32.2 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 2.2 blocks in his last five games), Curry and Thompson are all sitting for an extended stretch. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  23.6 points, 5.1 assists, 4.0 rebounds DeRozan and the Raptors continue to create space between themselves and the rest of the pack in the Eastern Conference. DeRozan iced the Raptors\u2019 conference-best 10th straight win over Indiana Thursday night with a late-game steal and dunk. He finished with 24 points, seven rebounds and four assists, matching his combined scoring and assist output from the previous two games. The Raptors have a five-game lead over Boston for the No. 1 spot in the final month of the regular season. Their improved depth, and coach Dwane Casey\u2019s penchant for exploiting it on a nightly basis, explains how a team can win back-to-back games with its best player suffering through subpar performances. But as much as we celebrate the Raptors\u2019 share-the-wealth approach, those late-game situations where DeRozan or All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry have the ball in their hands serve as the perfect reminder of what awaits this team in the playoffs. The Raptors, like every other contender, will only go as far as their stars can take them. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  26.8 points, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds Not that he needed the validation, but what LeBron James said about Lillard before the Trail Blazers whipped the Cavaliers was spot on. Lillard\u2019s work since the All-Star break ( 30.5 points, 6.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds ) \u2014 and Portland\u2019s rise to the third spot in the Western Conference \u2014 should be all the confirmation anyone needs. Lillard has been brilliant and even on a night when he can\u2019t find his shooting stroke ( he was 7-for-20 overall Thursday night ), he makes an impact. He dished out nine assists (against two turnovers) on a night when the Trail Blazers had a season-low seven turnovers. Portland is the real deal and the Moda Center, where the Trail Blazers are 17-1 since Dec. 28, should be a torture chamber for any playoff foe. 6. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans 7.

Runaway. And I say that with a healthy appreciation for what the [Donovan] Mitchell kid is doing for Utah. He\u2019s special, too. Simmons is just on another level. Athletically, he\u2019s as big and physical as you could ask for from a rookie. His ball skills are outstanding and he\u2019s clearly taken to the coaching in Philadelphia. Brett Brown has done a nice job grooming him last year when he didn\u2019t play but traveled with the team and learned by observing how things go down in our league. Did that give him an edge over the rest of these true rookie? Absolutely. But that\u2019s not his fault. You can\u2019t help it if you\u2019re injured and unable to play. What you can\u2019t do is waste that time or squander those learning opportunities that come from studying the game, in the flesh and on film, without the normal pressures that come with that transition from college ball or international ball to the NBA. \u201cSimmons used his time well, because he looked like a seasoned veteran early on this season. He didn\u2019t have that rookie deer-in-headlights look. He\u2019s looked really comfortable running that team from the start. And he\u2019s just scratching the surface of what he can become. I think he has chance to be one of the best in the game in the future, I really do. At his size with the ability to put up triple-doubles and overpower opponents at his position \u2026 his potential is just crazy to think about. When he gets a chance to spend an entire offseason refining his game, working on his shot and then banking all of the things he\u2019s learned competing against the best this season, there\u2019s no telling where his game goes from here. I\u2019m really interested to see how he responds in the playoffs. Can he take his game up another level then? That will really be telling, because with he and the big fella [Joel Embiid] as the cornerstones of the future, we\u2019re potentially talking about guys who could be the best at their positions one day growing together at the same time. That doesn\u2019t happen very often in our league.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here and  follow him on Twitter .

You\u2019re next up, apparently, on the list of cities and fan bases trying to lure LeBron James in free agency this summer with billboards. A group of Portland fans have started a Go Fund Me account to raise funds to pay for a billboard inviting James to sign with the Blazers. Similar sets of billboards have been launched by other fans, first by a remodeling company in Philadelphia (which put the billboards installed in Cleveland) and also by an attorney in Los Angeles (who had them put up in L.A.) . Tim Brown of The Oregonian has more on the push to get a billboard in Portland : Personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani put up four billboards around Los Angeles to try and woo James, who can enter free agency this summer .

The company\u2019s CEO says the goal is to bring James, a three-time NBA champion, to Philadelphia because \u201cwe think the best athletes should want to play here.\u201d When the billboards in Philadelphia were erected, James couldn\u2019t help but be flattered by them. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not. Not a distraction,\u201d James told reporters on Feb. 27 . \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering \u2014 but people in their respective city want me to play for them.

He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time. James famously announced he was taking his \u201ctalents to South Beach\u201d and signed with the Miami Heat in 2010.

Benson, who has also owned the NBA\u2019s New Orleans Pelicans since 2012, was 90. The NFL and NBA teams announced Benson\u2019s death on Thursday . He had been hospitalized since Feb. 16 with flu symptoms. When the NBA took over the financially troubled New Orleans Hornets in late 2010 and spent more than a year trying to find a permanent owner, Benson finally stepped in and bought the club for $338 million. The club is now known as the Pelicans and its estimated value exceeds $1 billion. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he\u2019d remember Benson as big-hearted and gracious, and praised the way he not only ran the Pelicans, but also hosted two All-Star weekends in New Orleans, the second after it had been moved from Charlotte following state legislation deemed discriminatory by the NBA. \u201cThe NBA family mourns the loss of New Orleans Pelicans owner Tom Benson,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBig-hearted and gracious, Tom topped off a distinguished business and sports career by acquiring the Pelicans in 2012. During his tenure, he hosted two highly-successful All-Star Games, rebranded the franchise and installed a first-class organization. He was a dear friend to me and so many others in the sports world, and the loss of his authentic and unique presence will leave an enormous void. We send our heartfelt condolences to Gayle, their family, the Pelicans and Saints, and his countless friends.\u201d Benson bought the Saints in 1985 when it appeared the club would be sold to out-of-state interests and perhaps moved out of Louisiana. He paid $70 million for the team, which is now worth close to $2 billion Benson\u2019s business acumen helped turn the Saints from a perennial also-ran into a contender \u2013 and the 2009 NFL champion. Yet his ownership also was less flatteringly marked by the 2012 bounty scandal and reports Benson did not want to bring the team back to New Orleans from San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. \u201cTom Benson\u2019s contributions to New Orleans and the National Football League were legendary. He purchased a team that had never had a winning season; by the third year of his ownership, the Saints were in the playoffs,\u201d NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. \u201cTom kept the Saints together through the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, and his decision to bring the team back to New Orleans gave the entire region hope and confidence that they would recover.\u201d Benson also became a leading New Orleans philanthropist. He helped fund Tulane\u2019s on-campus football stadium and the cancer treatment center at Ochsner Medical Center. The home of the NFL\u2019s Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio, also was renamed for Benson after an $11 million gift, the largest in the hall\u2019s history. Benson \u201cpossessed a deep passion for the game and was committed to its growth,\u201d said Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker, who was also the Arena Football League commissioner when Benson owned an arena team called the VooDoo. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called Benson a \u201cfriend and ally\u201d whose marketing and finance expertise guided the NFL\u2019s Finance Committee. \u201cHe was astute, exceptionally smart and an accomplished sportsman and businessman,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe pumped life and enthusiasm into a community and a franchise that had no winning seasons before he became involved.\u201d Benson\u2019s death comes on the heels of an acrimonious family split that has caused some uncertainty about the future of his professional teams. He made it known in January 2015 that he wanted his third wife, Gayle, to inherit complete control of the Saints and Pelicans, and Greg Bensel, the senior vice president of communications for both clubs, said the NFL and NBA have both approved Benson\u2019s succession plan. However, Benson\u2019s disowned daughter, Renee, and her two children, Rita and Ryan LeBlanc \u2013 who had long been in line to take over the Benson business empire \u2013 have vowed to prove their patriarch was manipulated against them while in a mentally enfeebled state. They lost a 2015 legal struggle for control of the teams, but could still contest Benson\u2019s will. Fans, however, will remember Benson\u2019s heavy New Orleans accent and parasol dances along the sideline after victories. He cut quite the figure among NFL owners when he first joined the league. His jovial game-day persona turned hardheaded, however, when it came to business. In 2001, he negotiated an unprecedented $187 million in concessions and state subsidies to keep his team playing in the Superdome through 2010 \u2013 a deal Benson said was necessary to succeed in small-market New Orleans. That lease was followed by another unusual arrangement in which the state stopped paying direct subsidies to Benson, but committed to relocate numerous state offices in a Katrina-damaged high-rise next to the Superdome \u2013 at above-market rents \u2013 if Benson rehabilitated the building, which is now called Benson Tower. Until recent years, fans often questioned whether Benson\u2019s desire for profit outweighed his loyalty to his native city. With the Superdome and much of the city wrecked by Katrina, the Saints temporarily relocated to San Antonio, where Benson had many business holdings. When officials there said they were talking to Benson about what it would take to keep the team, Katrina-weary residents in New Orleans reacted angrily. Graffiti reading, \u201cWarning, Tom Benson inside,\u201d was scrawled on numerous foul-smelling, discarded refrigerators that lined sidewalks around the city. But when the Saints returned to a still-reeling New Orleans in early 2006 \u2013 or were forced to by the league, which would not allow Benson to abandon the Big Easy \u2013 the region\u2019s fans responded with more than a decade of consecutive sellouts. The Saints became a source of inspiration during the tough early days of post-Katrina rebuilding. They improved from 3-13 in 2005 to 10-6 under new coach Sean Payton, and then advanced to the franchise\u2019s first NFC championship game. A Super Bowl title came in February 2010. Scandal followed two years later when the NFL uncovered a bounty system in which Saints players earned improper, off-the-books cash bonuses for hits that hurt or sidelined opponents. Payton wound up serving an unprecedented full-season suspension in 2012 and the Saints were fined $500,000 \u2013 even though Benson had ordered general manager Mickey Loomis to shut down the bounty program when the owner was told of it. One of four children, Benson grew up in the hardscrabble Seventh Ward of New Orleans. In 1945, Benson served in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS South Dakota. Then he studied business and accounting at Loyola University in New Orleans, went to work as a bookkeeper for Cathey Chevrolet Co., and was sent to San Antonio as a 29-year-old in 1956 to manage a Chevrolet dealership as a junior partner. Six years later, he took full control of the company and established his own dealership. He built his fortune primarily in the automobile business, as well as in banking and real estate. More recently, he got involved in thoroughbred horse racing and took over Dixie Beer. But his passion later in life was the Saints. He kept an office at the training facility and was frequently seen there and at training camp in a golf cart watching practices. Tom Benson and his first wife, Shirley, had three children, two of whom preceded their father in death. He also had several stepchildren from his marriage to his second wife, Grace, who died in 2003. In addition to his wife, estranged daughter and her two children, Tom Benson is survived by grandchild Dawn Jones, the daughter of Tom Benson\u2019s late son, Robert."},{"id":47037,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-owner-tom-benson-passes-away-90","date":"2018-03-15","title":"New Orleans Pelicans, Saints owner Tom Benson dies at age 90","content":" NEW ORLEANS \u2014 Tom Benson, 90, passed away peacefully Thursday, March 15, at Ochsner Medical Center with his wife Gayle Marie Benson at his side.

Mr. Benson purchased the Saints on May, 31, 1985. In 1987, the team posted its first winning season and advanced to the playoffs for the first time. Since being purchased by Mr. Benson in 1985, the Saints have earned 11 playoff berths, six division titles and captured Super Bowl XLIV in 2009, building a foundation for continued success, on and off the field. Known among his peers in the NFL as an important leader, Benson\u2019s input on the league level was instrumental, serving as chairman of the league Finance Committee for three separate stints. He also played a major role in New Orleans become a Super Bowl host five times since his purchase of the team. In 2012, Mr. Benson purchased the National Basketball Association\u2019s New Orleans Hornets franchise from the NBA, which the following season, he rebranded and had renamed the New Orleans Pelicans. Through his sports teams, business interests and the Gayle and Tom Benson Foundation, Mr. Benson was dedicated to assisting a myriad of charitable, faith-based and educational causes in the New Orleans and South Texas communities. Under Mr. Benson\u2019s direction his businesses and sports teams annually have put millions of dollars back into the community in financial support, in-kind donations, charitable appearances and the donations of goods and services. Over 50 deserving charitable organizations, foundations and agencies have annually received financial support from Mr. Benson.

Ainge was asked whether or not Irving may need surgery in the future to fix the recurring knee issues.

The former No. 1 overall pick sat out a March 5 win against the Chicago Bulls to rest that same knee, which he broke during Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

A former two-time All-Star and a Kia MVP contender last season, Thomas says he views himself as more than the reserve he has been for the Lakers since they acquired him in a trade deadline-day deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Thomas was a starter in the Lakers\u2019 last game, a 117-106 loss to the Western Conference-leading Golden State Warriors last night. Of the other 13 games he\u2019s played with the Lakers, though, Thomas has served as a reserve.

However, he says that backup duty is not a role he is looking for at his next stop : Per Amick, Lakers coach Luke Walton and associate head coach Brian Shaw met with Thomas at a Dallas steakhouse the day after the trade. At the time, the Lakers were playing well, having won 12 of their last 16 games heading into the showdown with the Mavericks.

He doesn\u2019t even particularly like standing out there to shoot, since it comes at the expense of other, more active and creative maneuvers on the basketball court \u2014 as his 33rd birthday approaches \u2014 that he still enjoys. But if standing out there to shoot is what\u2019s required in Houston Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system, then that\u2019s what Ariza is going to do.  Because he and his teammates are having too much fun this way. They put their stretch of 22 victories in the past 24 games on the line again Thursday against the LA Clippers. \u201cOne thing I know, these guys are hungry for something,\u201d Ariza said the other day, not just of the All-Hall (of Fame, in time) backcourt of James Harden and Chris Paul but of the squad overall. \u201cThey\u2019re hungry to win a championship. And there\u2019s really no ego there. We\u2019re able to communicate \u2014 I think communication is always the biggest thing allowing you to take that next step. And we\u2019re having fun. We don\u2019t feel pressure, we just go out and play.\u201d Ariza, on a team laden with veterans, is one of Houston\u2019s most reliable rudders. Fourteen seasons and 929 regular-season games into a career that got off to a shaky start \u2014 the No. 43 pick in the 2004 Draft , by a losing New York Knicks team \u2014 Ariza is a constant for the Rockets. With Harden and Clint Capela, Ariza is one of three players whose run with the franchise pre-dates D\u2019Antoni\u2019s arrival in 2015. But then, Ariza pre- or post-dates a lot of coaches\u2019 arrivals \u2014 he has played for 12 of them, from Lenny Wilkens and Larry Brown early in his career, through Stan Van Gundy and Rick Adelman, to Kevin McHale and D\u2019Antoni. Born in Miami, raised in Los Angeles, Ariza has changed teams six times. And changed his game considerably in the process.  How Ariza played when he reached the NBA compared to now reflects the evolution of the league\u2019s prevailing offensive strategies. In his first four seasons, divvied up between the Knicks, Magic and Lakers, Ariza used his quickness and his lean, 6-foot-8, 215-pound frame to slash to the basket or shoot from inside the opponent\u2019s defense. Only 3.8 percent of his field-goal attempts came from outside the arc; nearly one quarter of his shots were the \u201clong twos\u201d now considered so abhorrent. Ariza shot them at a poor rate (33.9 percent) but at least he was more accurate there than he was on 3-pointers (20.9). Compare that to Ariza\u2019s last four seasons, all in Houston (with the past three under D\u2019Antoni). Nearly two-thirds of his shots (64.4 percent) have been 3-pointers. His long twos are down to 5.5 percent, and 87 percent of his field-goal attempts come either from 3-point range or in the restricted area. The game has evolved and Ariza has adapted. \u201cHe\u2019s been about the same as he\u2019s always been,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m definitely not complaining. He might be shooting it a little better this year. Maybe making a few more drives to the basket, getting a little more comfortable with what we do.\u201d Ariza has occasionally been putting the ball on the floor and attacking to counter the perimeter-focused resistance Houston faces. That anyone has even noticed, and considers it a new wrinkle, amuses Ariza, because he always had that as part of his game. \u201cWhen I first got into the NBA, that\u2019s what I was pretty good at, getting to the basket,\u201d he said. \u201cAs my career played on, I developed a jump shot. I\u2019m just trying to do what my teammates need me to do. The defense takes away certain things, so in order to be successful and help my team, I have to do other things.\u201d Like a lot of players new to D\u2019Antoni\u2019s style, Ariza had to dial up his willingness to shoot the ball. That\u2019s a mindset that often doesn\u2019t come naturally to guys who haven\u2019t traditionally been first or second scoring options. \u201cJust being aggressive is the main thing,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cOne hundred percent you\u2019ve got to be aggressive. When you\u2019re not aggressive, you won\u2019t help this team at all. It messes up the whole flow.\u201d Said D\u2019Antoni: \u201cIt takes a little bit \u2014 even Chris Paul is going through that process. To catch and shoot takes a pretty quick trigger.\u201d At 12.1 points and 9.7 field-goal attempts per game, Ariza is Houston\u2019s No. 5 scorer. As a 3-and-D guy, the latter is a little more important than the former. His offensive (113.3) and defensive (105) ratings are solid \u2014 and he flexed new skills as a back-seat singer in one of Paul\u2019s State Farm commercials \u2014 but Ariza\u2019s efficiency ratings have him pegged as a below-average NBA player the past four seasons. That\u2019s one area in which the analytics-devoted Rockets might quibble with the numbers. Ariza has started all 54 games this season and is averaging 34.6 minutes. \u201cTrevor\u2019s a blue-collar player who does everything,\u201d veteran big man Nene said. \u201cHe can defend, he can pass, he can shoot it well. He can do multiple things in a game, and of course the way he deals with the players is very important. He is open to anyone in here. Everybody likes him, he\u2019s a leader and he makes everybody better.\u201d Here\u2019s a for-instance: D\u2019Antoni credited the Rockets\u2019 veterans, Ariza among them, for making sure bad habits didn\u2019t creep in during the team\u2019s recent 17-game winning streak. Coaches often dread such streaks, because it\u2019s harder to bend players\u2019 ears without a few teachable-moment losses. Not these days, though. \u201cIf we\u2019re not setting the right picks or boxing out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, \u201cbefore they even get back to the bench, they\u2019ve already discussed it and got it.\u201d Said Ariza, who won a championship ring with the Lakers in 2009 and is hoping for a second this spring: \u201cWe know how to police ourselves. He lets us be creative. He lets us do our thing. And he\u2019s there for reinforcement, the staff\u2019s there for reinforcement. We appreciate it. We do our best not to let him down. That\u2019s the benefit of having a veteran team.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry wanted nothing more than to play on his milestone 30th birthday, a home game against the Lakers on Wednesday night. The two-time MVP is doing his best to see the big picture, though. The playoffs are a month away and he plans to be in top form to lead another special Golden State run. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this countless times but I feel very confident in the approach that we\u2019re taking to get to as close to 100 percent as possible going into the stretch run of the regular season and then obviously the playoffs,\u201d Curry said after his team\u2019s shootaround Wednesday. \u201cI would obviously love to be out there playing every game down the stretch, to be out there with my squad. At this point there\u2019s enough time, not just me, we have a bunch of guys banged up, that we all can prioritize health and understand that we need to all be ready to go.\u201d Curry will miss at least the next four games for the ailing defending champions as he heals from his latest right ankle injury, while Splash Brother Klay Thompson also will miss those games. The Warriors announced on Tuesday\u2019s injury report that Thompson has a fractured right thumb that will sideline him until he is re-evaluated March 22. After Wednesday\u2019s matchup with Los Angeles, they also will miss Friday at home against the Kings, then road games at Phoenix on Saturday and at San Antonio on Monday. Golden State is 11-6 this season without Curry, who missed an 11-game stretch with the ankle in December then injured it again March 2 at Atlanta but was able to play. Draymond Green was also out Wednesday with soreness in his right shoulder. Backup center David West was sidelined for a fifth consecutive game with a cyst in his right arm. Rookie Chris Boucher was up from the G League Warriors for his possible NBA debut. It was still hard for Curry to think about missing Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cSelfishly I was always keying in on tonight just because it was a big day,\u201d Curry said. \u201cYou only turn 30 once. I have to keep a big-picture perspective. I understand the thought process around not just how my ankle feels today versus next Wednesday versus next Friday but the things that I need to do rehab-wise to strengthen my core, everything that protects your ankle so that when I do come back I\u2019m ready. Obviously there\u2019s risk playing. The reason I hurt my ankle, I landed on somebody\u2019s foot twice. You can\u2019t help that. I\u2019ve got to do whatever I can to lower the probability of putting myself in that situation again, especially at this point in the season.\u201d Curry rolled his ankle driving left for a layup at the 9:38 mark of the first quarter in the win against the Spurs. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next Tuesday. Golden State did not practice Tuesday as originally planned after the team held an early surprise birthday celebration Monday for Curry, whose wife Ayesha was involved. The couple arrived into San Francisco for the bash \u2013 200-plus people, according to the man of the hour \u2013 on a yacht. Coach Steve Kerr was seen dancing on stage with his players in social media videos from the festivities. \u201cI\u2019m really nosy, too, so the fact that they still were able to execute it is pretty remarkable,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely thankful for that, all that love.\u201d"},{"id":41325,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-golden-state-warriors-klay-thompson-fractured-right-thumb","date":"2018-03-14","title":"Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson out with fractured right thumb","content":"A day after finding out that former Kia MVP winner Stephen Curry will be out at least another week, the Golden State Warrirors got some more injury news.

In the Warriors\u2019 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday, Thompson sprained the thumb . According to Sam Amick of USA Today , the team is confident he\u2019ll return around March 22. Thompson has missed only one game this season, on Jan. 10 against the LA Clippers for rest . He is averaging 19.7 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game this season and ranks in the Top 5 of the NBA in 3-pointers made (206) and 3-point percentage (44.2 percent) .

But he\u2019s worthy of it. Branded early in his career as more of a team liability than an asset \u2013 a bundle of size, skills and potential undermined by a lack of discipline and an allegedly low basketball IQ \u2013 McGee wound up typecast as one of the league\u2019s court jesters with a recurring role in \u201cShaqtin\u2019 A Fool,\u201d the TNT segment that laughs at NBA players and their most jaw-dropping, knuckleheaded mishaps. Even as McGee began demonstrating his value last season in a bit role with the Golden State Warriors \u2013 he posted career highs on a per-36 minute basis at 23.0 points, 11.9 rebounds, with a 25.2 player efficiency, while actually averaging only 9.6 minutes \u2013 it took a notorious Twitter war with Shaquille O\u2019Neal to get the Hall of Famer\u2019s size-22 sneakers off his throat. Now McGee has taken the next step, moving into the Warriors\u2019 starting lineup since the All-Star break and giving them much of what they need at just the right time. It goes deeper than Golden State\u2019s 7-2 mark since then, because the champs were 44-14 before McGee got this opportunity. The Warriors play host to the Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday night at Oracle Arena ( 10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). \u201cOur record was good before, too,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Sunday in Minneapolis. \u201cThe change was basically to give us a little burst early \u2013 JaVale\u2019s a burst guy, he\u2019s a high energy player. We were getting off to very slow starts. We saw some things on tape, for how teams were guarding us, and we felt that having that lob threat made some sense to start.\u201d McGee, 30, in his 10th NBA season, has started 13 games in all, averaging 13.7 minutes, 6.4 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks while shooting 69.6 percent. But his impact on the Warriors overall since Kerr went to him for a transfusion is far greater. Prior to All-Star Weekend, Golden State essentially was breaking even early in its games, posting a 111.9 offensive rating and 111.3 defensive rating in 58 contests. Since McGee got swapped into Zaza Pachulia\u2019s spot, both those numbers have improved: 123.3 offensive rating, 103.2 defensive. \u201cWe play center by committee,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cZaza\u2019s going to play a role. Jordan Bell, David West, [Kevon] Looney, they\u2019ve all got to contribute for us. But right now we like JaVale starting and he\u2019s playing well. \u201cHe\u2019s gaining some confidence. He\u2019s had a tough season in the consistency of his minutes \u2013 it\u2019s harder to play, harder to perform at a high level when you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going in. I don\u2019t know how many games I didn\u2019t even play him at all. But I\u2019m really proud of JaVale for how he hung in there and handled himself while he was out, working hard just like Zaza\u2019s doing now.\u201d McGee has kept a relatively low profile, taking over for Pachulia as the Warriors\u2019 lone non-All-Star starter. He quipped recently to Warriors\u2019 beat writer Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle that his one big adjustment to this new role is simply drinking \u201cmy energy drink earlier.\u201d This is his longest unbroken string of starts since 2011-12 in Washington. Since then, through stints with Denver, Philadephia, Dallas and Golden State, McGee started only 26 times in his next 299 appearances. Yet he brings a game at both ends not unlike center DeAndre Jordan for the Clippers. \u201cHe\u2019s almost a defense unto himself just because of the shot-blocking and the length,\u201d Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said of McGee. \u201cPachulia is going to be a physical, body guy. McGee is length and athleticism. And then of course, if David West plays, it\u2019s veteran savvy.\u201d McGee had one of his poorer performances Sunday at Minnesota , scoring two points with three rebounds and finishing firmly in the red at minus-15. Pachulia, by contrast, had 16 points and 11 boards off the bench. But McGee still is a plus-28 in the nine games he has started since the break.  \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t get a lot of credit that he deserves,\u201d Wolves veteran forward Taj Gibson said. \u201cHe\u2019s changed his whole game around, changed his whole mentality around, being on a winning team. He does everything the right way. You haven\u2019t heard any kind of crazy things about him in the papers, so I\u2019m truly happy for him. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you play for a playoff-bound team, a team that is trying to do something special. It kind of make everybody better. He\u2019s just an athletic big. He\u2019s one of those guys who, no matter how many years he\u2019s been in the league, he\u2019s always a lob threat. He\u2019s always a weak-side shot blocker. I\u2019ve got to be on my toes to keep him off the boards.\u201d Said Kerr: \u201c[It is] important for our guys to understand \u2013 if they don\u2019t know me by now, I mean, I play everybody \u2013 at some point you\u2019re going to get your chance. So you have to stay ready. That\u2019s exactly what JaVale\u2019s done.\u201d Like any NBA player, McGee still is capable of an occasional bonehead moment. But he has the Warriors laughing with him rather than at him, and that makes all the difference. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers. Across the board career-highs \u2014 points (23.6), rebounds (5.3), assists (4.3), steals ( a league-leading 2.2 ), field goal percentage (.472), 3-point percentage (.369) \u2014 and, he\u2019s shooting 80.4 percent from the line. Per NBA.com\/Stats, among all regular guard starters this season (60 or more games), Oladipo is second in the league in Defensive Rating (101.7, behind only Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown). He looked like a high-volume, low production player his first four seasons in the league. He\u2019s changed that narrative with one outstanding season, and looks for all the world like a building block for Indy with Myles Turner going forward. 2. Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets. He\u2019s embraced being the every day point guard for the Nuggets, seemingly with very little adjustments or problems, while raising his averages (16.2 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game) and shooting the ball much better this season on twos and 3-pointers. 3. E\u2019Twaun Moore, New Orleans Pelicans. It\u2019s hard to judge with certainty whether he\u2019s just benefiting playing off of Anthony Davis (and, for half the season, DeMarcus Cousins), but Moore has been terrific in his first season as a full-time starter at the two, solidifying New Orleans\u2019 lineup. He\u2019s been outstanding behind the arc ( 41.6 percent on 3-pointers ) and pretty efficient shooting overall, while guarding his position \u2014 he\u2019s seventh among starting two guards this year in Defensive Rating . Honorable Mention: I didn\u2019t think you could give MIP to a guy with eight years in the league coming into the season, but Jrue Holiday has also been really, really good in New Orleans this season.  Steve Aschburner : Victor Oladipo is going to win this award and it won\u2019t even be close. Oladipo turned whatever pressure he felt from being traded by OKC and stepping into Paul George\u2019s sneakers in Indiana into extreme motivation and a laser focus on this season. The results have been astounding, with Oladipo playing his way to an All-Star selection while leading the Pacers to a 40-28 record that a lot of us figured would be more like 28-40 by now. For my second and third slots, I like a couple of big men : Houston\u2019s Clint Capela , who is the indispensable third side of that Rockets triangle ( they\u2019re 35-2 when Chris Paul, James Harden and Capela play together ). And the Lakers\u2019 Julius Randle , who since Jan. 1 is averaging 18.3 points on 57.4 percent shooting with 9.1 rebounds, compared to last season\u2019s 13.2 ppg, 8.6 rpg and 48.8 percent. Shaun Powell :  First: Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers. He went from riding shotgun in OKC to being the top gun in Indiana and made himself into a steady and reliable first option. Second: Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets. The Pistons gave up on him once . The Bulls gave up  on him twice . He began the season coming off the bench in Brooklyn. Then, everything changed once he was elevated to starter, averaging 13 points and 6.9 assists per game. Third: Clint Capela, Houston Rockets. His development from a raw and gangly center to a more polished finisher and rebounder has given the Rockets a much-needed inside guy on a team of shooters. John Schuhmann :  1. Victor Oladipo , who has been better (more efficient) in a much bigger role than he had with the Thunder. He has seen the league\u2019s second biggest increase in usage rate (among players that have played at least 1,000 minutes each of the last two seasons), has increased his scoring efficiency ( true shooting percentage ), and has seen just a minimal drop in assist-turnover ratio. In short, he\u2019s gone from sitting in the back seat for the Russell Westbrook Show to being the leading man for a team that has been just as good as his old one. 2. Domantas Sabonis. I prefer not to look at second-year players for this award, but Sabonis makes too compelling of a case. He\u2019s seen the league\u2019s eighth biggest increase in usage rate, the league\u2019s biggest increase in rebounding percentage, and the league\u2019s third biggest increase in true shooting percentage (among players who have taken at least 300 shots each of the last two seasons). He went from being an afterthought in the OKC offense to being a fulcrum on a team that\u2019s been better offensively than his old one . 3. Spencer Dinwiddie\u2019s poor shooting of late (he has the league\u2019s worst effective field goal percentage over the last five weeks ) has this spot on my ballot up for grabs. Other candidates include Ed Davis, Tyreke Evans, Brandon Ingram, Trey Lyles and Tomas Satoransky.  Sekou Smith :  Clint Capela is the first name I\u2019m putting on my list, which values organic improvement as opposed to say, a change in scenery that produces better results. The Rockets, as devastating as they\u2019ve been this season with Chris Paul in the fold, have gotten a huge lift from Capela\u2019s breakout season. There\u2019s a reason the Rockets got out of the Dwight Howard business a couple years ago. They clearly saw something in Capela and it\u2019s paying huge dividends this season. I know some people have probably forgotten about it already, but before he went down for the season with that torn ACL, Kristaps Porzingis was showing signs of being a potential two-way superstar . Who knows how he bounces back after a 10-month, or more, recovery? But he\u2019s second on my list. And finally, while he doesn\u2019t have the raw numbers on his side, it\u2019s hard to ignore the boost the Boston Celtics get when Terry Rozier is in the mix . The player-development component in Boston is sound and Rozier, who is third on my Most Improved list, is proof."},{"id":41357,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-more-remarkable-no-3-seed-indiana-pacers-portland-trail-blazers","date":"2018-03-14","title":"Blogtable: More remarkable that Indiana Pacers or Portland Trail Blazers are No. 3 seed?","content":" * * * More remarkable to you: The Pacers as the No. 3 seed in the East, or the Blazers as the No. 3 seed in the West?  * * * David Aldridge :  The Pacers. I was loud wrong about the Paul George trade ; it\u2019s not just that Indiana survived the loss of its best player, it seems to have gotten a franchise-level player in return in Victor Oladipo. As we went to the same high school (One DeMatha!), this pleases me, but I\u2019m not going to pretend I saw this in Oladipo during his stints with the Orlando Magic and Oklahoma City Thunder. I believed Indiana would be a Lottery team and that that was the way it would have to rebuild. But Oladipo has had an All-Star season and Nate McMillan will get strong Coach of the Year consideration for the job he\u2019s done. GM Kevin Pritchard should get some Executive of the Year nods, too; not only did he not listen to me and other members of the chattering class who insisted he got rooked by OKC, he also softly added a key free-agent piece in Bojan Bogdanovic ( career-high 39.6 percent on 3-pointers this season) who has been crucial to the Pacers\u2019 rise, solidifying them at small forward in George\u2019s stead. Steve Aschburner : The Pacers are a bigger surprise, because they supposedly were cinches to land in the lottery without Paul George. The Blazers at least looked to many like a lower seed out West and were fare more of a known commodity. But what Indiana has done has been one of the league\u2019s happier, unexpected stories, rallying around Victor Oladipo\u2019s resurgence and truly tackling the long season as a cohesive team. Shaun Powell :  The Pacers win this contest and it\u2019s not even close. Remember, they were universally targeted for last place after the Paul George trade , which was roundly criticized. Yet here it is, mid-March, and they\u2019re still winning games. As good as the Blazers have looked lately, their rise is partly due to Kawhi Leonard\u2019s injury and the continued confounding nature of the Oklahoma City Thunder. John Schuhmann :  In my Week 1 Power Rankings , I had Portland ninth in the West and 13th overall, and every West team I had above them is still in the playoff race. So, no major regrets there. I had Indiana 12th in the East and 26th overall, behind Orlando, Brooklyn and Sacramento. So, I\u2019ll take the \u2018L\u2019 on that one and say that the Pacers\u2019 success is more remarkable. And maybe what\u2019s most remarkable is that they\u2019ve played so well without Myles Turner taking a real step forward until after the All-Star break. Victor Oladipo is a star, other guys have played well in their roles, they\u2019re pretty relentless with their offensive attack and, with time, Turner has become a strong defensive anchor.  Sekou Smith :  Both the Trail Blazers and Pacers being in the top three of the standings this late in the season is an absolute stunner, given the preseason prognostications for both teams. I give a slight nod to Portland, though, because the Western Conference playoff terrain is a bit tougher than what the Pacers have to deal with in the Eastern Conference. What great stories from both places, though. All-Stars Damian Lillard and Victor Oladipo have done yeoman\u2019s work driving their respective teams to this point. Portland\u2019s Terry Stotts and Indiana\u2019s Nate McMillan should also get strong consideration on Coach of the Year ballots, as well. This is a great reminder, too, that nothing serves as a better motivator than diminished expectations. Lillard has been proving that from the moment he entered the league. And no one guessed the Pacers would be better after the Paul George trade. And yet, here they are \u2014 with a nice assist from Cleveland\u2019s struggling bunch and John Wall\u2019s injury absence in Washington. * * *"},{"id":41356,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-does-it-make-sense-kawhi-leonard-come-back-now","date":"2018-03-14","title":"Blogtable: Does it make sense for Kawhi Leonard to come back now?","content":"* * * Looking at the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 remaining schedule, does it even make sense to bring Kawhi Leonard back now ?

But when you have the tradition of San Antonio, you don\u2019t fold, even when you don\u2019t have a team good enough to win a title, as certainly seems the case this season. The Spurs play it out, no matter what. It\u2019s one of the things I most admire about the franchise; like the Utah Jazz teams of the Jerry Sloan era , it can accept losing in the playoffs if the team has done all it could do in a given year. So the Spurs would, and should, play Leonard down the stretch. He is the team\u2019s best player and his presence will help Dejounte Murray immensely, if nothing else. And, unfortunately, you never know what can happen; every team, including the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors, is one ACL away from disaster. Steve Aschburner : Certainly they should bring Kawhi back if he\u2019s deemed to be healthy. This is a franchise that has played for the postseason for a long time, and that\u2019s still intact, given how closely the lower seeds are grouped in the West. Is there really that much difference between coach Gregg Popovich giving players occasional nights off vs. Leonard getting a bunch of weeks and, OK, months off to rest, rehab and recuperate? Who knows, this might start a new trend of star players being kept in bubble wrap until April, with the first 82 games devalued to exhibition level. Shaun Powell :  If you\u2019re suggesting the Spurs tank, let history show that the franchise was accused of doing so twice, and came away with David Robinson and Tim Duncan. We all know what happened after that. The foundation of the respected franchise is built on getting those Hall of Famers. That said, it would go against everything the Spurs stand for today to sit a player, much less their star, for the sake of the lottery. If he\u2019s healthy, he should play. And they\u2019d make the playoffs if he did. John Schuhmann :  First of all, I would ignore the standings in regard to the decision about Leonard.  If he\u2019s healthy and isn\u2019t risking further damage by playing, then he should play, because the Spurs certainly aren\u2019t going to be mathematically eliminated any time soon. And if he gets the green light, the Spurs should hit the gas. They play 12 of their final 14 games against teams with winning records (and another against the spoiler Los Angeles Lakers), but they can beat good teams when healthy and a 21st straight trip to the playoffs is worth playing for. Right now, they\u2019re tied for eighth place with the Jazz , who they will play in San Antonio next week . So they control their own destiny and folding would be silly.  Sekou Smith :  I don\u2019t believe in using the \u201cT\u201d word, not even hypothetically, after seeing that fine the league handed down to Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban . But I do not believe all is lost in San Antonio just yet. I also believe in Kawhi Leonard and the impact he would have on the Spurs down the stretch of this season. He should definitely play if he\u2019s healthy enough to do so. Then we can let things play out in whatever way basketball\u2019s higher powers decide. That said, if there is one organization I\u2019d ride with at lottery time it\u2019s the Spurs. Sure, they are rarely in that space. But their success rate is fantastic (see David Robinson and Tim Duncan). But chasing ping pong balls goes against every competitive fiber of my being. I cannot go there \u2014 not even in theory."},{"id":41323,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hassan-whiteside-dwyane-wade-miami-heat-may-be-out-vs-sacramento-kings","date":"2018-03-14","title":"Hassan Whiteside, Dwyane Wade ruled out for game vs. Sacramento Kings","content":"As their West coast road trip forges on, the Miami Heat will be without two key members of the lineup again tonight.

There is still time, however, for them to climb from that No. 10 spot they hold and, perhaps, soon make a playoff run with a familiar face in the mix. After last night\u2019s 109-93 loss to the Houston Rockets , Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he plans to talk with injured All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard about his possible return date. Leonard has not played since Jan. 13 and has appeared in just nine games this season. Reports surfaced last week that the Spurs were targeting Thursday\u2019s home date with the New Orleans Pelicans as a possible return date for Leonard . However, Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports and Ramona Shelburne of ESPN reported on Tuesday that the Spurs don\u2019t expect Leonard to be ready for Thursday\u2019s matchup. Here\u2019s more from Charania on what\u2019s next for the Spurs and Leonard : ESPN\u2019s Michael C. Wright has more on Popovich\u2019s talk with Leonard : Leonard was a top three finisher in the voting for the past two Kia MVPs and cornerstone of the Spurs\u2019 post-Tim Duncan era. His injury followed a sprained ankle that forced Leonard to miss all but the first game of the Spurs\u2019 4-0 loss to the Warriors in last season\u2019s Western Conference finals .  Leonard\u2019s return would bring an end to a seemingly endless saga, and one highly unusual for the usually drama-free Spurs. Leonard, the 2014 Finals MVP and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, was first revealed to be injured in training camp. Popovich would later say that he\u2019d never encountered an injury like Leonard\u2019s during a career stretching back to the early 1970s. Leonard finally made his season debut on Dec. 12, scoring 13 points in 15 minutes as the Spurs lost to the Dallas Mavericks . He saw limited action in eight of the next 16 games, averaging 16.2 points in 23.3 minutes, before returning to the sideline in early January. The Spurs have withered in his absence, faltering in 15 of their last 23 games after last night\u2019s defeat. More unusual still were the stream of stories surrounding Leonard\u2019s rehabilitation, with ESPN reporting that his relationship with the Spurs had \u201cchilled\u201d as the process wore on and Popovich saying last month that he\u2019d be \u201csurprised\u201d if Leonard returned this season.  But Leonard disputed those reports last week, asserting that he said he and the Spurs had always been on the same page during his rehab and that he \u201cfor sure\u201d hoped to finish his career in San Antonio. * * *"},{"id":41362,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/indiana-pacers-new-arena-name-2019","date":"2018-03-13","title":"New name coming to Indiana Pacers' arena in 2019","content":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Bankers Life name will be coming off the Indiana Pacers\u2019 arena after next season.

To put that into perspective, starting point guard Dejounte Murray was not yet a year old when that disastrous season ended, while the man he replaced, Tony Parker, was a precocious teenager just finishing his first year at France\u2019s prestigious National Institute of Sport. But as has been well-chronicled over the years, it came with the silver lining of all silver linings: An unexpected victory in the ensuing Draft lottery, and the right to draft Tim Duncan . The rest is, quite literally, history: A run of consistent success never before seen in the NBA featuring five championships , 20 straight playoff appearances and 18 straight campaigns with at least 50 victories . (That run would stand at 20 as well were it not for the strike-shortened season in 1998-99, when the Spurs finished 37-13 \u2014 a 61-win pace over 82 games \u2014 en route to their first title .) Reports of the Spurs\u2019 imminent demise have been plentiful over the years, and invariably wrong. When \u201999 mainstays like David Robinson, Avery Johnson and Sean Elliott succumbed to age, they promptly reloaded with Parker and Manu Ginobili. And as that crew began to wear down, they made a shrewd draft-day trade for Kawhi Leonard and squeezed out another title in 2015 . When Duncan finally retired after 19 illustrious seasons in 2016? The Spurs won 61 games without him, and were well on their way to victory over the Warriors in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals before Leonard went down with a series-ending sprained ankle. But now, with only 15 games remaining in the 2017-18 campaign, even more streaks are in jeopardy. At 37-30, with 14 losses in their past 21 games, the Spurs must finish 13-2 to keep their string of 50-win seasons alive. With Leonard reportedly set to return from his lengthy battle with right quadriceps tendinopathy as early as Thursday, it\u2019s certainly possible. And 10 of those remaining games are at home, where the Spurs are a formidable 23-8. But those are about the lone positives. Otherwise, 13 of those games coming against winning teams, including one apiece with Western Conference leaders the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors. The Spurs\u2019 situation is even more dire given that they have zero margin for error, sitting in 10th place in the West and just one game away from missing the playoffs entirely, something an entire generation of NBA fans has never experienced. But with one streak snapped and several more on life support, could the long-prophesied end of the Spurs\u2019 historic dynasty be here?

Kerr, the Golden State Warriors coach who has been outspoken on many social justice issues , drew a big crowd and a standing ovation before sharing how his life was affected by gun violence more than three decades ago when his father was shot dead in a terrorist attack. \u201cI\u2019m not here because I\u2019m the Warriors coach. Actually I am, because I wouldn\u2019t have been invited. I\u2019m here because I\u2019m a citizen of this country and we\u2019re a democracy and when people say stick to sports, stick to coaching, that means nothing,\u201d Kerr said Monday at Newark Memorial High School. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to speak on something that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d Kerr joined U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and students from throughout the South Bay to discuss the issue. Also in attendance was Matt Deitsch, 20, whose younger brother and sister stayed locked in closets during last month\u2019s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cI think he sees what so many of us see: There\u2019s a moment in this country that can make a difference,\u201d Khanna said. Deitsch identified himself as the oldest member of the \u201cNever Again\u201d movement. He and others in his group plan to march in Washington, D.C., on March 24. \u201cIt will change things because the youth is mobilizing at a rate that scares the status quo,\u201d said Deitsch, who noted: \u201cThis is affecting all communities. It can happen anywhere.\u201d Kerr believes young people will help create change. \u201cAll I\u2019ve really done is expressed my outrage and my concern,\u201d he said. Kerr said he\u2019d like to do more, perhaps getting \u201cmy team involved.\u201d \u201cI have been truly inspired by what I\u2019m seeing lately from the kids at Douglas High School,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by what\u2019s happening. It feels real. For the first time, it feels like something\u2019s happening.\u201d Kerr\u2019s father, Malcolm, president of the American University of Beirut, was murdered in Beirut when Kerr was 18 and a freshman at the University of Arizona. \u201cI know how the Parkland families feel, or the Aurora families, or Sandy Hook,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI know what it feels like. I met family members from Las Vegas. I know what that feels like. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d"},{"id":41354,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kent-bazemore-knee-out-season","date":"2018-03-12","title":"Atlanta Hawks' Kent Bazemore out for season with knee injury","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Atlanta Hawks guard Kent Bazemore will miss the remainder of the season with a bone bruise in his right knee.

Matthews is averaging 12.7 points in his third season with Dallas since signing a $70 million, four-year contract in 2015.

I\u2019m not defined by that moment, but it was a defining moment in my life.\u201d Dooling, then, knows what could be in the offing for Kevin Love and DeMar DeRozan \u2014 two All-Stars \u2014 who became the latest NBA players to detail their public battles with mental wellness . Love wrote a first-person account last week in The Players\u2019 Tribune of the panic attack he suffered earlier this season. DeRozan spoke last month of the depression he\u2019s dealing with during what may be his most successful NBA season . Their disclosures came as the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are close to naming a Director of Mental Health and Wellness, who will run an independent mental wellness program that is being jointly funded by the league and union. The league has had programs dealing with wellness be part of the Rookie Transition Program, Team Awareness meetings with players during the season and its Player Assistance Program over the years. Players who\u2019ve dealt with mental illness have provided testimony about dealing with the stresses of life as pro basketball player \u2014 the constant demands for money, attention, time and the like \u2014 in healthy ways. But the new office will be the most comprehensive program dealing with mental wellness created to date.  The mental wellness program \u2014 the product of almost a year of discussions between the league and union that began as the sides were working out the new Collective Bargaining Agreement \u2014 will allow players to seek treatment and counseling outside of the framework of their individual teams, if they want. Existing team physicians and other resources will still be available to them, too. The new director will have authority and a significant role for players who seek his help. But it is not clear if the director will have the ability to unilaterally decide if a player dealing with a mental wellness issue should not play in a given game or games to deal with those issues, regardless of what the player\u2019s team medical staff may think. This was a main point of contention, you may recall, between the Houston Rockets and forward Royce White, whom Houston selected in the first round of the 2012 Draft . White wanted his own personal doctors, all of whom were experts in mental wellness, or third-party doctors who could act as a go-between, to have a say in determining an overall wellness program for him, which could have included consulting on decisions such as when his Generalized Anxiety Disorder was at a point that he would not be able to play on a given night. He says the Rockets agreed to help formulate a protocol that laid out a treatment plan for him going forward, while White played in the G League. But White was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in the summer of 2013 , having never played a game for Houston, before any formalized protocol was finalized. Other than a three-game stint with the Sacramento Kings the following season and a Summer League stint with the Clippers, White has not yet played in the NBA. The new mental wellness program also dovetails with the league reviewing mental health and wellness policies and programs in the NBA, WNBA and G League. Late last year, the NBA hired the Jed Foundation to serve as an advisor on mental wellness issues. The Foundation, founded by Donna and Phil Satow in 1998 after their son, Jed, committed suicide, seeks to prevent suicides in teenagers and young adults. Its Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Victor Schwartz, has been reviewing the NBA\u2019s policies. Schwartz has found strengths and gaps within individual teams, and has been working to fill some of the gaps at the team level. The NBA has been drilling deeper into youth basketball as well, engaging programs like Jr. NBA and NBA Fit with wellness messages and programs, realizing that physical fitness is not all of total health. Mental wellness outreach will be a part of the inaugural Jr. NBA World Championships, a global basketball tournament for players 14 and under, that will be in Orlando next August. Dooling is also part of the league\u2019s new initiatives. In January, he started working as a Player Wellness Counselor, going around the league to talk with NBA teams and players about trying to deal with problems before they metastasize the way they did in Dooling. Dooling was sexually abused as a child , first by a friend of his older brother, then by women in the Florida neighborhood in which he grew up. Dooling buried the events in his subconscious, going on to star at Missouri and was picked 10th overall in the 2000 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic . He played 13 NBA seasons and became known as a good teammate, close with guys like Rajon Rondo when they were on the Boston Celtics together.  But Dooling was triggered when a man grabbed him in a restroom in Seattle in 2012 , just after he\u2019d agreed to re-sign with Boston. The event brought everything boiling to the surface. He began acting strangely and lost weight. His wife, Natosha, couldn\u2019t reach him emotionally; she called Dooling\u2019s mother trying to find out what was wrong, but no one knew \u2014 Dooling had never told Natosha about the abuse. Finally, in August, 2012, Dooling\u2019s behavior concerned his neighbors outside of Boston, where he and the family had returned to get ready for the season. He was outside with his children when a neighbor thought he was playing too roughly with his kids and called the police. Police arrived at the house and didn\u2019t arrest him, instead taking him to a mental health facility, where he signed in voluntarily and spent a week there as doctors found levels of medication that allowed Dooling to process clearly as he began dealing with his breakdown. It is a difficult thing for a professional athlete to be able to do, especially in real time, Dooling says. \u201cFrom my experience as a player, in order to make it to the apex in sports, you have to be almost flawless and perfect at every intersection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to just shut up and play. We\u2019re trained to not process and talk about our emotions, how we feel. The environment we come from. We don\u2019t process things. We internalize a lot. Our body acts out on us. It comes out in the form of anxiety, PTSD. A lot of people will self-care for the symptoms but they won\u2019t deal with the core issues. You have to do therapy. You have to make sure you have a great support system. There are a lot of variables you have to have to have total wellness.\u201d Dooling will report to the new Director of Mental Health and Wellness, serving as liaison between players and the program resources. \u201cI can respond and I\u2019m still pretty relevant,\u201d Dooling said. \u201cI played against most of these guys. They see a safety net in me. I\u2019ll be providing them with support and resources. We\u2019ll be able to respond in real time, not only doing preventative stuff, but infrastructure that will outlive all of us \u2026 in 20 years, this program will be further advanced than it is now. It will be able to help not only ballplayers but society in general. If we start taking it seriously, society will follow that. We have the capacity to scale our model. The most important thing is to get that director in place so we can grow organically.\u201d So many players in recent years have acknowledged they were dealing with mental health issues while playing: Metta World Peace , Delonte West , the late Eddie Griffin , Larry Sanders , White, former WNBA star Chamique Holdsclaw and Hall of Famer Jerry West . And now, in the last few weeks, so have DeRozan and Love, along with the Washington Wizards\u2019 Kelly Oubre, who told NBCSportsWashington.com last week that he also has dealt with anxiety . In The Players\u2019 Tribune story, Love detailed a panic attack he suffered Nov. 5 in a game against Atlanta . He said he was already \u201cstressed\u201d with family problems. After not feeling right throughout the first half, Love said everything \u201chit the fan\u201d early in the third quarter. \u201cCoach (Tyronn) Lue called a timeout in the third quarter,\u201d Love wrote. \u201cWhen I got to the bench, I felt my heart racing faster than usual. Then I was having trouble catching my breath. It\u2019s hard to describe, but everything was spinning, like my brain was trying to climb out of my head. The air felt thick and heavy. My mouth was like chalk. I remember our assistant coach yelling something about a defensive set. I nodded, but I didn\u2019t hear much of what he said. By that point, I was freaking out. When I got up to walk out of the huddle, I knew I couldn\u2019t reenter the game \u2014 like, literally couldn\u2019t do it physically.\u201d Love said Lue came up to him during the timeout, but he ran past him into the Cavs\u2019 locker room. \u201cI was running from room to room, like I was looking for something I couldn\u2019t find,\u201d Love wrote. \u201cReally I was just hoping my heart would stop racing. It was like my body was trying to say to me, You\u2019re about to die . I ended up on the floor in the training room, lying on my back, trying to get enough air to breathe.\u201d This came after DeRozan acknowledged that a tweet he sent out the morning of the All-Star Game \u2014 \u201cthis depression get the best of me\u201d \u2014 was far more than his quoting Kevin Gates\u2019 song \u201cTomorrow.\u201d DeRozan\u2019s battles with depression, a condition that was exacerbated in recent months by the illness of his father, Frank, who\u2019s been in an L.A. hospital with serious medical issues. \u201cHonestly, the response, I can honestly say that I wouldn\u2019t have even thought how the response, how it came out, I wouldn\u2019t have thought I\u2019d ever gotten anything like that,\u201d DeRozan told me recently . \u201cEspecially me. I\u2019ve never been one who wanted any type of attention, good nor bad. The response I got from people was so uplifting, positive, refreshing. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. But it made me feel good. You just look at certain things. People say \u2018you helped me. Because if you\u2019re going through something like this, I can get through it.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible. By far one of the most incredible things in my career that I\u2019ve witnessed outside of basketball.\u201d The National Institute of Health\u2019s National Institute of Mental Health estimates that, in 2016, more than 44 million Americans suffered from some form of mental illness, ranging from mild to moderate to severe, and impacting more than 18 percent of all U.S. adults. Of that 44.7 million, all with what NIMH calls AMI \u2014 Any Mental Illness, defined as a mental, behavioral or emotional disorder \u2014 10.4 million had a Serious Mental Illness (SMI), defined as \u201ca mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.\u201d Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act, passed in 1990 and which bars discrimination against individuals with mental health issues, requires an employer to provide what the Act calls \u201cReasonable Accomodation\u201d to qualified individuals with disabilities, \u201cunless to do so would cause undue hardship.\u201d Reasonable Accomodation, according to the ADA, should allow the employee to \u201cperform the essential functions of the position.\u201d ADA cites as an example a cleaning company that rotates its staff to different floors of a building on a monthly basis. \u201cOne crew member has a psychiatric disability,\u201d the ADA example continues. \u201cWhile his mental illness does not affect his ability to perform the various cleaning functions, it does make it difficult to adjust to alterations in his daily routine. The employee has had significant difficulty adjusting to the monthly changes in floor assignments. He asks for a reasonable accommodation and proposes three options: staying on one floor permanently, staying on one floor for two months and then rotating, or allowing a transition period to adjust to a change in floor assignments. These accommodations are reasonable because they appear to be feasible solutions to this employee\u2019s problems dealing with changes to his routine. They also appear to be effective because they would enable him to perform his cleaning duties.\u201d Whether Reasonable Accommodation will be a part of the new NBA\/NBPA program is also uncertain. For years, the NBA left decisions about players\u2019 fitness to play in games while dealing with mental wellness issues to the individual team\u2019s physicians, many of whom were not experts in mental health. The Dallas Mavericks were the first team, in 2000, to employ a full-time psychologist, Dr. Don Kalkstein , as the Director of Sport Psychology\/Mental Skills. But now, many teams do. The Indiana Pacers, for example, hired Dr. Chris Carr as their Team Performance Psychologist in 2011 . He has an office at the team\u2019s practice facility, and frequently travels with the team on the road. \u201cI think he\u2019s a tremendous resource for all our guys,\u201d Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard said Sunday. \u201cAt some level, everybody uses him for a sounding board, some deeper than others. We give our players full access. We talked about it early, and our players feel like it\u2019s important, too. Not only do we give them the resource, but they have to use it.\u201d  Pritchard says the team is not privy to the details of conversations Carr has with team employees \u2014 which are not limited to the players. \u201cWe all want to have a stake in our players\u2019 health and wellness. We don\u2019t look at them as just players; we look at them as human beings. We want to help not only our players, but our coaches, everybody. Dr. Carr is not just with the players. He helps us all communicate better.\u201d But the issue of who decides the best course of action for a player \u2014 program director, or team, or some combination of both in conjunction with the player \u2014 is still a salient one. Teams don\u2019t even know, by way of contrast, if one of their players is in the league\u2019s Drugs of Abuse program, until after the player fails multiple drug tests or doesn\u2019t comply with a mandated treatment program. The medical director of the program is the only person with that information; once it\u2019s determined a player isn\u2019t in compliance, he can be suspended or, ultimately, terminated from the league. But there is no arguing with the medical director, unless the player can provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence , per cap expert Larry Coon\u2019s invaluable FAQ , to the league\u2019s grievance arbitrator that he was not at fault or negligent for the presence of a drug of abuse or sports enhancing drug. (The grievance arbitrator has the authority to reduce or rescind the player\u2019s penalty.) The player could argue, for example, that he didn\u2019t know or suspect he was taking a banned substance. What is clear is that the new program will be run independently of the teams, league and union. \u201cWe don\u2019t want players to be discouraged from getting help when they need it because they\u2019re concerned that it will get back to the team, or it may affect their play, or it may affect their next contract,\u201d NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts told SB Nation\u2019s Paul Flannery in an interview last month . Yet even that can be debated when it comes to wellness. White is one of 6.8 million adults (3.1 percent of the U.S. population), according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, who lives with GAD. People with GAD, according to the ADAA , \u201cmay anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry. They may worry more than seems warranted about actual events or may expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern.\u201d But White believes, strongly, that transparency when it comes to mental wellness is crucial. Even something as seemingly innocent as anonymity for players who use the new wellness program, White argues, helps contribute to the continued stigma about mental wellness. No one, for example, would seek anonymity if they had a sprained ankle or separated shoulder. Why, then, is this treated differently, he asks?  \u201cThe articulated aspiration for a union that would call for a new policy, kind of in its genesis, should set the bar really high,\u201d White, now playing his second season for the London Lightning of the National Basketball League of Canada, said by phone Saturday. \u201cThe height of the bar shouldn\u2019t be that players need anonymity when it comes to mental health issues, which is what (Roberts) suggested, that everything\u2019s going to be kept private, with the independent people,\u201d White said. \u201cThe articulated aspiration should be a collaborative and comprehensive program that involves all of the parties involved, that is going to be founded and based on a newly introduced knowledge of what mental health is. And that\u2019s going to take the owners being educated; it\u2019s going to take the GMs being educated, and the coaches and the trainers and the ballboys and the players and everybody else, up and down the line. When that happens, the players won\u2019t need anonymity.\u201d White argues that Love\u2019s disclosure exemplifies the problem of granting or desiring anonymity. \u201cThink of what Kevin Love said about his panic attack, and think of the pressure that it added that he couldn\u2019t tell his teammates,\u201d White said. \u201cThink of the consequences of him not being able to tell his teammates. Those same consequences, you could map onto management as well, and the ownership. Ideally, and what we are seeing and continue to see, is the sort of optimal support and treatment plan for people with these conditions is that people with these conditions be afforded the opportunity to come forth with their struggles openly, and communicate them on an ongoing basis. \u201cThe reason why anonymity is kind of the default is because people have conceded that when certain decision-makers get a hold of certain information, they will do corrupt things with it. That shouldn\u2019t be the system. We have to be able to get over the hurdle of things like that. The reason they created HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which keeps medical information confidential) is \u2026 why? Because people don\u2019t want other people to have their medical information, because they\u2019ll do unjust things with that information \u2026 \u201cI know the NBA is a big corporation, but when it comes to decision-making, there\u2019s not that many parties involved. How many owners are there? There\u2019s an ownership group; it can\u2019t be that many. It\u2019s a situation where you could give a baseline education to where anonymity is maybe no longer needed. Maybe a player still does want to keep the anonymity \u2026 well, then, that\u2019s up to the player. But don\u2019t set the standard so that the players who would be up front, like me, are actually then persecuted for being up front.\u201d White also notes that the new program lays out many ideas he has been advocating since 2012 , including bringing in outside experts like the Jed Foundation who can help fill in some of the gaps in the league\u2019s knowledge and protocols. White has had no issues in Canada. \u201cOne of the misconceptions is that I was really asking for much in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no special formula or plan that I really need. All I\u2019m saying is that should be an issue, is there a system that we can properly deal with it? \u2026 Here in Canada, the traveling isn\u2019t the same, so there wasn\u2019t a huge conversation about that. And as far as the mental health side goes, the owner straight up told me, \u2018you have anxiety. I know a lot of people who have anxiety. If you ever need any help or any support when it comes to anxiety, don\u2019t be afraid to come to me and we\u2019ll figure things out.\u2019 That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the potential of what support looks like.\u201d Dooling often tells the story of when his father died in 2009, and how, in the course of burying him, people he knew came up to him and asked for money (\u201calmost $200,000,\u201d he says), asked for pictures, and autographs, and jobs. He felt like he never really got a chance to mourn his loss. How does someone process that in a healthy manner? \u201cA lot of things are sexy on the surface, like money and fame,\u201d Dooling said. \u201cBut people try to run scams on us. Family members might try to take advantage of us. We\u2019re often thrust into the patriarch position and we might be the youngest member of the family \u2026 when it was time to pay the bill, all the family members look the other way. \u201cYou internalize those things. And it can have an impact on your body \u2026 but we\u2019re told, don\u2019t talk about it. Shut up. Suck it up. You\u2019re a man. And we develop this condition of not being able to express our emotions. Because I chose to go to therapy there have been a lot of members of my family who\u2019ve gone to therapy as well. It forced them to look at their own issues. My kids, my wife, my mother, my siblings, they\u2019ve started to do their work.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Most everyone figured there\u2019s be some kind of valedictory, a final lap when Wade was ready to retire, a ceremonial last contract with the team that took him with the fifth pick of the historic 2003 Draft , and for the player who became the most important player in the franchise\u2019s history (with all due respect to Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and LeBron James). But that was supposed to happen down the road, not when Wade still had some tread left on his tires. It didn\u2019t work for him in Cleveland and few thought it really would, with him starting, and then coming off the bench (though he actually wasn\u2019t that bad defensively). But when Cleveland\u2019s General Manager Koby Altman blew up his underachieving team, he did Wade the solid of sending him home for nothing, really, something that went over well in the Wade household . Yet Wade hasn\u2019t been back just for the fun and games. Life has smashed all South Florida in the face, with the horrific killing of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14 \u2014 an awful Valentine\u2019s Day. One of the kids killed, 17-year-old Joaquin Oliver, had just become a U.S. citizen, and he was a huge Wade fan. His parents buried their son in Wade\u2019s jersey . It tied Wade up in knots emotionally, as you\u2019d expect; he dedicated the rest of the season to Joaquin and has done more than send thoughts and prayers. He met Joaquin\u2019s parents (as did his mother) and gave them a pair of custom-made shoes; he paid a surprise visit to the school last Friday ; he had an exhibit honoring the slain students set up this past weekend at Miami\u2019s Art Walk in the Wynwood neighborhood . He and his wife donated $200,000 toward defraying the expenses of local teenagers who are planning to go to the march in Washington, D.C. and other cities in two weeks supporting gun control reform, got a commitment from the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Carmelo Anthony and challenged other NBA stars to pony up. In the midst of all that, he\u2019s not just been a show pony for the Heat. He\u2019s not the Finals MVP from 2006 anymore, but he can do so many things that were familiar to the Heat during their glory days. Not much homework was required \u2014 \u201cwe know him as well as anybody,\u201d Coach Erik Spoelstra said last week. \u201cHe\u2019s a family member, so we know how he is. It\u2019s also not like we didn\u2019t keep in touch.\u201d Wade\u2019s already helped win a couple of games off the bench \u2014 27 points in 25 minutes against the 76ers ; 16 points and six rebounds a few days later to help throttle Philly again. It has followed that the often-somnolent home crowds in Miami have reawakened, seeing not an apparition but a still-capable veteran, grateful to be home but aware that more is required of him these days than leading the Heat on a postseason run. Me: What are those moments like for you now, when the crowd is getting up and cheering even before you take off the warmups? Dwyane Wade: It\u2019s special, you know? It\u2019s something (different) about me when I have a Heat jersey on than when I had the Bulls or Cleveland jersey on. I\u2019ve been to all these cities. I\u2019ve been on the road. It\u2019s just something about Dwyane Wade with Miami on his chest. Our fans are amazing. It\u2019s definitely, a night like tonight when you\u2019re on a back to back and you\u2019re coming in late. But when you hear the crowd behind you and they\u2019re cheering, you get up, it gives you that extra motivation and energy to give them everything you have. \u2018Cause they came to see you. Might be their first time, you don\u2019t know. Me: I think we all figured you\u2019d wind up back here at some point, but did you think it would be this soon? DW: Nah. I mean, when I made the decision to go to Cleveland , I didn\u2019t think it would be this season. Definitely, I knew, I always wanted it to be one day. I think it was just perfect timing, too. It was just right, the timing to come back. Everything works out in its weird ways. I definitely think the timing was better than if I had come back at the beginning of the year. For the city, the state and the team, I felt like my leadership, my voice, my face was needed at that time I came back. Me: But in coming back, to that team as opposed to any other, how did you reconcile the fact that you can\u2019t be that guy you were in 2009, 2010? I can\u2019t be the Finals MVP. I have to be the best version of who I am now. DW: I\u2019m a realist. I\u2019m real to myself. I know who I am. I\u2019ve always been that way. I look in the mirror every day at myself, and if I can\u2019t tell myself who and what I am, then no one can. I\u2019ve always been able to look in the mirror and say all right, this is where you are, this is where you are, this is where you are. And try to put myself in a position where I get the best out of where I am, and also the team that I play for gets the best of what I am. Coming back to Miami at this time, for me, it\u2019s selfless, man. I just want to help this team win, and I don\u2019t really care about how many minutes I play right now, how many shots I get. I\u2019m just taking what the game gives me. Last night, nine shots. Tonight, probably more. So each game is different and I\u2019m trying to do whatever I can each game to help this team get to the point where they\u2019re in the playoffs. Me: Whatever needs doing that night? DW: Whatever needs doing that night. That\u2019s what my dad told me. When I first started playing basketball, my dad was the first one who was never, never patted me on the back when I scored 30. He always wanted me to be a complete player; he always wanted me to be a team player. I didn\u2019t get it early on, and as I got to high school, my high school coach was the same way. My college coach was the same way. So I\u2019ve always been, whatever the team needs, I play a team sport. I don\u2019t play an individual sport. And you can still get everything you want in the midst of that. You can still star in it. It hasn\u2019t changed anything in my life, coming off the bench, at all. I understand that. Me: How important was it for you that your kids got to see you in that uniform again? DW: I think especially for my oldest son, Zaire, I think it was great. Obviously me being home, but it\u2019s just like everyone else \u2014 I look right to him in a Heat jersey. He\u2019s getting older, he\u2019s 16 years old, and he got to feel the love. My youngest son Zion, he gets to feel the love of the city. They come home and we\u2019re talking, and he says \u2018dad, everyone\u2019s so happy you\u2019re back.\u2019 It has to feel good for them as well. I know as a 36-year-old athlete, to still have my kids proud of me and not saying little smart comments like kids do, it feels good. Me: You mentioned that this was the right time to come back. Was that especially acute given what happened at Stoneman Douglas, and with the young man that really was a fan of yours that was killed in the shooting? DW: Something\u2019s going on in the world, and it speaks to you. You try to get involved and you try to get into it. When something happens in your backyard, it\u2019s even tougher. We represent, the Miami Heat represents the state of Florida. And not just on the entertainment side, off the court. And I\u2019ve learned that from the Miami Heat organization. This situation happened, and you start hearing all the stories from all the kids. From a basketball side, and being fans of mine and the Miami Heat, the only thing we can do for the families is to honor them \u2014 obviously by the way we play, but honoring the school. Putting the hashtag on my shoes. Honoring a young man who was buried in my jersey. Continuing to make sure that the kids who was lost, that their legacy in life continues to live on. Just keep talking about them, moreso than the one who took their lives. Let\u2019s not put the light on him; let\u2019s put it on the 17 young lives that was lost. It\u2019s definitely, myself and Udonis (Haslem) and other guys that\u2019s been trying to do things to impact the families, try to impact the community as much as possible during this tough time. It\u2019s our duty, I feel, as public figures and figureheads in the state to do that. Me: And not shut up and dribble. DW: Definitely. We\u2019re never going to do that. I love athletes today, nowadays, feeling confident to step up and stand out, and talk about things that they believe in. We\u2019re, we might make a lot of money, we might be on TV, we might be looked at, but we\u2019re part of the community. We hear the community. We hear what everybody\u2019s talking about. And we understand that their voices might not be heard the way our voices would be heard. Like I said, it\u2019s my duty to speak for them as well. We might not have the same challenges that our community is having, but it\u2019s our job to not only give back and do things that we do, but also be the voice and be the face for our community. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. \u2014 Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster ( @TeamJuJu ), Tuesday, 3 p.m. Well, at least it\u2019s different from \u201cLeBron to the Lakers\u201d or \u201cLeBron to the Sixers\u201d or \u201cLeBron to the Rockets.\u201d He could have been a hell of a tight end if he\u2019d gone that route, to be sure. \u201cIt\u2019s not even worth talking about those Magic years, and it\u2019s definitely not worth talking about those Knicks years. That part of the story is like the end of Goodfellas, when everybody\u2019s getting jammed up and ratting on each other and they\u2019re driving around looking up in the sky for police helicopters. It was a mess, man. I got to both of those teams, and it takes you like five minutes of being in the locker room before you realize: Nope. No wins here.\u201d \u2014 Former Houston Rockets star Steve Francis , in The Players\u2019 Tribune , recalling some of his wild ride from the streets of D.C. as a kid, to being a Lottery pick of the Grizzlies, to playing with Yao Ming in Houston, to being unceremoniously dumped to Orlando late in his career, to being done at age 32. \u201cI can\u2019t control what the other team\u2019s gonna fee. I\u2019m just gonna go out there and hoop and whoever takes it to heart and takes their losses salty, I can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d \u2014 Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray , to the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tania Ganguli , after Lakers coach Luke Walton said that Murray had, for the second time this season, been \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his team in the waning moments of a game, both Denver victories. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve disappointed the fans and we haven\u2019t won enough. I can tell you this team works really hard and Stan works hard. He\u2019s been here for four years and has dedicated his whole life. We talked the other day and I\u2019m not giving up on Stan and I\u2019m not giving up on this team.\u201d \u2014 Pistons owner Tom Gores , to local reporters , in the midst of what looks like another year without a playoff berth for Detroit, which has made the postseason just once in Stan Van Gundy\u2019s first three years there as team president and coach. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Li Rui: Lottery Reform, Part the Thousandth. From Jimmy Chow: Lottery Reform, Part Infinity. From Roland Beech: Let me take the last first. Roland, for those who don\u2019t know, is a legend in the analytics game, the founder of the website 82games.com who was thought of so much he has had subsequently VP jobs with both the Mavericks and the Kings in recent years. And as evidenced by his Fighting Loss stat, he keeps on top of these kinds of things. (Thank you for writing, Roland!) It should thus not surprise that of all these ideas I think his is the best and most equitable. Returning to the simple, one ball\/card per Lottery team system, which the NBA used until 1990, when it went to the weighted system to give the team with the worst record the best chance to get the first pick, would also be my preference for fixing the current system. As Roland wrote, the beauty of a system like this is that it would fully democratize the Lottery and give all teams in all situations a chance to get better fast. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say New Orleans stumbles down the stretch and misses the playoffs by a game or two. How great would it be for the future of basketball there if the Pelicans got the first-or second-pick and could add a great young player to team with Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and\/or DeMarcus Cousins if he re-signs? But it would also provide immediate help to the Phoenixes and Sacramentos of the league if they were so lucky. Most importantly, as Roland wrote, going back to the old system would eliminate any benefit from tanking \u2014 and, thus, would likely end most of it around the league. Which is the best possible outcome for everyone. We discuss guns. Again. From Scott Young: Well, let\u2019s unpack all of that, Scott. First, I do not assume that any discussion about banning certain types of guns (or, in our country, banning anything) would or should be \u201ceasy.\u201d I would cite in response the quote attributed by most to Albert Einstein: \u201cwhat is popular is not always right, and what is right is not always popular.\u201d Getting Civil Rights and Voting Rights and Housing Rights for African-Americans was not \u201ceasy.\u201d Nor was it \u201ceasy\u201d to get women the vote. Nor was it \u201ceasy\u201d to get same-sex marriage rights. But, in all of those cases, it was the right thing to do. So is common sense gun regulation. The \u201ctyranny\u201d argument supporting the availability of all weapons for everyone is, as you no doubt know, one that has been twisted into grotesque caricature over the last few decades by a relentless push from the right wing of the American body politic, financed in large part and fanned rhetorically by the National Rifle Association (which is, by the way, its complete right to do; our country is based on the notion that if you can get enough people to agree with your position on anything, you can try and get it codified into law). But that doesn\u2019t mean that I have to agree with that push. Warren Burger, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court appointed by Richard Nixon \u2014 he, no liberal \u2014 famously said in 1991 that the Second Amendment \u201chas been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud \u2014 I repeat the word \u2018fraud\u2019 \u2014 on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v Even the late Antonin Scalia \u2014 he, also, no liberal \u2014 wrote, in the case that actually established, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, a Constitutional right of citizens to carry weapons in 2008, Heller vs. District of Columbia , that there were limits to the Second Amendment : We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. \u2018Miller\u2019 said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u2018in common use at the time.\u2019 307 U.S., at 179, 59 S.Ct. 816. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \u2018dangerous and unusual weapons.\u2019 I would argue that the AR-15 is a \u201cdangerous and unusual weapon.\u201d And, while many cite the example of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in Schenk vs. United States in 1919 that a person cannot falsely shout \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theatre as evidence of the limits of the First Amendment protection regarding free speech (Schenk, a socialist, had been arrested and charged under the Espionage Act, whose limits on speech during wartime were upheld by the Court), the Court\u2019s current position on First Amendment limits was set in a case where, ironically, the Court overturned the conviction of a Klansman for speech that had initially been viewed as advocating violence. The case, Brandenburg vs. Ohio , was heard in 1969. Brandenburg, a Klan leader in Ohio, had invited a reporter to come to a Klan rally in 1964 in which the usual things about black people and Jews were said. Brandenburg spoke at the rally and said the usual things Klansmen say about the government being on the side of blacks and Jews and against the white man. But because the reporter was there and wrote down the things Brandenburg said, he was subsequently arrested and ultimately convicted under Ohio\u2019s Criminal Syndicalism statute, that state\u2019s version of a law passed by many states after World War I, most notably California. That law forbid \u201cany doctrine or precept advocating, teaching or aiding and abetting the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts of force and violence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control or effecting any political change.\u201d Brandenburg hired the ACLU (!) to appeal his conviction after subsequent Ohio courts had upheld it, and in \u201969, the Supreme Court overturned his conviction \u2014 and in doing so, overturned much of the precedent set in the Schenk decision. The Court held that abstract discussion of violating laws, as Brandenburg had done in his speech, could not be subsequently punished by government \u2014 with one exception: Freedoms of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. (emphasis mine) The point is that there are , in some cases, limits to free speech, and thus, limits to even the First Amendment \u2014 of which journalists, especially, are quite protective. And, as Scalia wrote in supporting Heller, there are limits to the Second Amendment as well. (There are limits to just about all the Amendments; police cannot enter your home and search it, as enumerated in the Fourth Amendment \u2014 unless they have probable cause and can get a warrant from a judge to do so.) I would not support any law or law enforcement body that tries to take away legally purchased handguns (and I would include in this automatic\/semiautomatic handguns like the Luger, Glock, Beretta, etc., that not only are used for home defense and sport, but also have historic and\/or retail value). I would not support any law or law enforcement body that tries to take away legally purchased rifles (but not knockoffs of the M-16, like the AR-15, or other military weapons). I would not support any law or law enforcement body that tries to take away legally purchased shotguns (I am willing to listen on the arguments about why you\u2019d need semiautomatic\/automatic shotguns). I think any of those types of guns, used individually or in tandem by people who have been properly trained to use them, are more than adequate enough for home defense, and certainly should be free to be used for hunting, target shooting and the like. I draw the line at guns like the AR-15, that are not, as much as you or others may argue, designed for hunting, or home defense, or anything of the sort. They are designed to kill as many human beings as possible in as short an amount of time as possible. They are weapons of war, which were designed to be used on a battlefield, not to be purchased by teenagers or the mentally ill. Fox News contributor Retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters \u2014 he, he writes for the third time, no liberal \u2014 just wrote that these types of weapons should be banned from civilian use . I support a ban on the AR-15. I also support slowing down the process of legally purchasing other guns. The reasoning is the same as it would be for someone who wants to buy a car, or a house, or who wants to become a lawyer, or a doctor. No one says \u2018why can\u2019t I become a doctor in three days?\u2019 We all understand that such an important undertaking requires that you demonstrate, over a period of time, that you are competent and trustworthy enough to handle the job. We all understand that buying a car requires you to demonstrate that you can drive well enough to use one, that you have enough money to buy one and can make the payments, and that you can purchase insurance to protect yourself and others in case of an accident. Buying a gun should require, at the least, similar demonstrations of fitness. In Japan, it takes four months to get a gun , during which time prospective buyers have to take classes in gun ownership and use, visit their local police, and are thoroughly investigated to see if there are any red flags in their background, if they can properly lock and store the weapon(s) in their homes, and the like. And then, they get their gun. I applied for the Global Entry program a few years ago, which allows for expedited security through airports around the world. I had to meet with and be interviewed by law enforcement. I had to wait a few weeks so that they could check me out. Which they did. Eventually, I got my Global Entry card. I did not ask, \u2018why can\u2019t I get my card in 48 hours?\u2019 If you are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide in your past, why would that kind of procedure to get a gun be a problem for you? And before you ask, no, it would not catch every crazy person who wanted to buy a gun. But it would catch more of them. Similarly, a ban on the AR-15 and similar types guns would not end all mass shootings. It would not end all killings associated with domestic violence. It would certainly not stop all crime. No sentient person would argue the contrary. My argument is that we have to start somewhere. There is a reason the most of the most recent mass murderers used this particular gun. No, it wouldn\u2019t stop anyone from stabbing death, or getting killed by getting hit in the head with a shovel. When we have a spike in mass stabbing\/shovel deaths, perhaps I will rethink my position.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (29.7 ppg, 4 rpg, 7 apg, .564 FG, .905 FT): Making 40-burgers seem commonplace. 2) Kevin Durant (33.8 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 4.3 apg, .463 FG, .909 FT): This seems \u2026 disloyal . Where are your principles, man? 3) LeBron James (29.8 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 7.5 apg, .561 FG, .571 FT): My invite, apparently, got lost in the mail . 4) Kyrie Irving (15 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 4.5 apg, .571 FG, .1.000 FT):  Uhh, we\u2019re gonna need to take 10 here . As a matter of fact, let\u2019s just take lunch here and come back at 2, okay? 5) Anthony Davis (27.7 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 6.3 bpg, .516 FG, 1.000 FT): Just turned 25. Ooof. 54 \u2014 Years since Boston last hosted an All-Star game, a streak that will continue after the Celtics decided last week not to make a bid for the 2022 Game . Boston hosted four of the NBA\u2019s first 14 All-Star games at the old Boston Garden, but the last of those was in 1964. 334 \u2014  Days, per Elias Sports Bureau, since the Rockets, Warriors and Cavs all lost on the same date. Each went down Friday night, to the Raptors, Blazers and Clippers, respectively \u2014 the first time that had happened on the same date since last April 10, near the end of the 2016-17 regular season. 98 \u2014 Career triple doubles for Russell Westbrook, after posting his 19th of the season Saturday in the Thunder\u2019s win over San Antonio. Westbrook will soon become just the fourth player in history to have 100 triple-doubles when he hits the mark, joining Oscar Robertson (181), Magic Johnson (138) and Jason Kidd (107). 1) A million moons ago, Doc Rivers coached an Orlando Magic team whose leading scorers were Darrell Armstrong and Ron Mercer to an improbable 41-41 record, missing the playoffs on the last day of the season. It was a great coaching job. The job he\u2019s doing this season with the Clippers, who might just sneak into the playoffs despite trading\/losing Chris Paul before the season and moving Blake Griffin during the season and having about 11,931,104 injuries to the players that were left, is just as good. 2) My beloved American University Eagles are dancing again for the second time in four years, after beating Navy for the Patriot League championship Sunday morning! They didn\u2019t lose a game all season at home (including a win over the Big 10\u2019s Penn State), they set a school record for wins with 26 and they featured the Patriot League Player of the Year and Coach of the Year, along with the conference tournament MVP. Pretty great season! Congrats! 3) A Sunday seeing Tiger in red again, near the top of the leader board, getting himself back into form and ready to challenge for championships again, is a beautiful Sunday indeed. 4) Juliet Macur, a brilliant writer and journalist,  writes and journals brilliantly here . 1) Utah has won six straight and 18 of its last 20 games, Rudy Gobert has been outstanding and Defensive Player of the Year worthy. Yet the Jazz is still in ninth place in the west, and outside the playoffs, this morning, tied with the Nuggets. But Utah has a great chance to move ahead of Denver and catch the eighth-place Clippers with a very favorable schedule down the stretch. 2) Enough with the LeBron billboards begging him to come play for your city . Stop groveling. He\u2019s a basketball player, not Amazon II. Thousands of jobs aren\u2019t going to come to town if he plays for your squad, nor will Elon Musk build a high-speed rail system for your town. Just get on with life. 3) Who in the everloving holy hell thought this was a good idea ? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Did it count double what some ordinary contest might have? Triple? Keep going. More like exponential. It\u2019s too early to claim that Minnesota\u2019s resiliency in the comeback from 12 points down, against the defending champ, saved their season. But the dueling scenarios, win vs. lose, were rather stark for a team facing a rigorous and largely uncharted final month. Fail Sunday, and the Wolves would be lugging a four-game skid on the road to face Washington Tuesday and San Antonio Saturday. By the time they got home to face Houston Sunday night, the losing streak could be six, going on seven. The Timberwolves at the All-Star break was a surprising third seed in the West. However, since Jimmy Butler\u2019s absence from the lineup after a right meniscus tear on Feb. 23, the Wolves have gone 2-4. Now the Wolves, whether they admit it publicly or not, are driven simply to qualify. Period. Ending up seventh or eighth is no prize, given a likely first-round ordeal against either the Rockets or the Warriors. But for a franchise that hasn\u2019t reached the postseason since 2004, either would be far better than landing ninth. By beating the Warriors, though, the Wolves bought themselves time and opened a smidgen of breathing room over the next few days. More than that, they responded to a serious challenge the way a playoff wannabe is supposed to. They didn\u2019t unravel, they stuck to what was working and they had players slide into Butler\u2019s roles as primary defender, go-to scorer and late-game closer. That is essential until the All-Star wing and obvious team leader returns, ideally, for playoffs that his teammates can deliver. Center Karl-Anthony Towns scored 14 of his team-high 31 points in the fourth quarter. Wing Andrew Wiggins scored 22 of his 23 in the first three quarters to help Minnesota claw back to an 84-84 tie. Those two stepping into the void of Butler\u2019s injury suggested the sort of growth that, frankly, coach Tom Thibodeau and the team\u2019s followers might look back on after this season (and postseason?) as a turning point. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for everybody, and certainly those two, in that whenever you have someone like Jimmy go out, it\u2019s an opportunity to grow and get experience in different situations,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it a lot. We have good veterans on the team. But this is an opportunity for them to step up and lead.\u201d Sure, Golden State was playing without team MVP Steph Curry (ankle) and ace reserve Andre Iguodala (wrist). But the visitors still had three All-Stars and the motivation of Friday\u2019s loss in Portland to propel them through the matinee. So, the Wolves did well to start with what Towns admitted was both \u201curgency\u201d and \u201cdesperation.\u201d They did even better to close with aplomb. Towns and Wiggins, both still 22 years old, stayed cool in reacting and thwarting Golden State double-teams. Wiggins, who still needs to attack and earn his way to the foul line more often, wound up with a team-high plus-21. Towns shot 6-of-10 in the final quarter, while Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson were combining to go 3-for-13 and 11 points. Butler\u2019s presence this season often has taken the ball out of the two younger stars\u2019 hands late in games. But Towns is so skilled, inside and out, he should get more opportunities when games are on the line \u2013 and will in Butler\u2019s absence. He came in averaging just 3.2 field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter this season, with 1.8 buckets and 5.1 points. Compare that to his 5.7 makes, 10.6 shots and 15.4 scoring averages through the first three quarters of games so far this season. His usage rate drops from 22.4 to 20.9 when it ought to go up. You\u2019d believe that too if you saw his work in the final three minutes, from bulling through Draymond Green for a layup that made it 101-96 to stepping in for a left baseline jumper two possessions later. At 104-103, Towns posted up Green near the end line again, banged a bit, then spun for a fadeaway jumper. Next time down, he followed up a shot against Durant to all but clinch it. The play of Towns, Wiggins and the other three Minnesota starters took any onus off Derrick Rose. Newly signed by his old Chicago coach, Rose had a rusty, regrettable debut with the Wolves, missing five of his six shots with two turnovers and a minus-17 in just 6:36. But his presence, if nothing else, ought to remind Towns and Wiggins that 22 is plenty old enough to grab a pack of Wolves by the scruff of their necks and take responsibility. Rose was 22 when he became the youngest MVP in NBA history, leading the Bulls all the way to the Eastern Conference finals that season. Minnesota basically is in the playoffs now \u2013 every outcome matters, bolstering or damaging its run to the postseason. There\u2019s no running away now, no hiding either. \u201cI think we\u2019re more prepared because we\u2019ve had most of the season to go through experiences,\u201d Towns said. \u201cNow that we\u2019re at this point, we have the chance to do something great. It\u2019s for us as a group to take all the experiences we\u2019ve had \u2013 of losing close games, winning big, winning games offensively, winning games defensively \u2013 and putting them to [use].\u201d It is vital that the Wolves\u2019 young stars stay focused on the opportunities before them, rather than succumbing to the pressure. Said Towns: \u201cThe thing is, you don\u2019t ever want to have pressure turn to stress. We have to make sure we keep our composure. Obviously, the situation we\u2019re in, it\u2019s a lot of pressure on us. But we can\u2019t turn that into stress, because that\u2019s when we start becoming undisciplined and start making errors that are more mental.\u201d The proof now is in the playing, said Thibodeau. \u201cThe best leadership you can have is your actions,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s not what you say. Oftentimes people say things and never do what they say. It\u2019s what you do.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It\u2019s one of Tom Thibodeau\u2019s most familiar exhortations, a mantra of sorts to keep his teams locked in, digging down and generally committed through whatever grueling test they\u2019re facing, be it a game, a road trip, a spate of injuries or the entire season. The trouble for Derrick Rose with that particular Thibs-ism is, so often, he has been the rope. On one side of an unfortunate tug o\u2019 war, we\u2019ve had the Rose loyalists, the fans, friends and family who believe that the 2010-11 NBA Most Valuable Player\u2019s return from injury hell to elite status is just one more, legit opportunity away. Pulling from the other side, there is a growing group of Rose skeptics who are convinced that the Chicago kid\u2019s best days \u2013 his most explosive, elusive, game-changing moves \u2013 are behind him, strewn on the floors of too many surgical rooms and rehab gyms. Rose, 29, knows they\u2019re there. One group pulling for him, the other doubting him. And in an unusually candid and forceful moment Saturday, the normally soft-spoken Rose delivered a stark message to them all. \u201cYeah,\u201d Rose said after his first full practice since signing a minimum-salary contract Thursday to join the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cThis is how I feel about the whole perspective on it: You can have your perspective on me as far as I\u2019m a bum, I can\u2019t play, I can\u2019t shoot, this and that. All right. Cool. I have no hard feelings with that. I\u2019m cool with that. If that\u2019s how you feel, that\u2019s how you feel. \u201cBut at the same time, I don\u2019t need your [bleeping] validation.\u201d Rose\u2019s eyes burned bright, in a direct response to the many health challenges he has endured from acquaintances and strangers both, picking at whatever good or bad is left of his basketball career. \u201cI know who I am,\u201d Rose continued. \u201cI know the type of player I am. So, you respect that and I respect that, and we should be good. That\u2019s how I feel about it.\u201d In other words, you work your side of the street, Rose will continue to work his. If there are NBA administrators like Thibodeau, the Wolves\u2019 head coach and president of basketball operations, willing to give him another chance, he\u2019ll be chasing the ghost of his own self while trying to help somebody win. Rose\u2019s latest grab at faded glory began in Sunday\u2019s matinee against the defending champion Golden State Warriors at Target Center, where the Timberwolves beat the Warriors, 109-103 . Rose scored two points on 1-for-5 shooting from the field in his Wolves debut. It probably is his last, best shot to salvage something from a 2017-18 season that\u2019s been largely lost due to injury, yes, but other factors outside Rose\u2019s control as well. What looked like a terrific opportunity back in training camp \u2013 signing with Eastern Conference power Cleveland Cavaliers and home to the game\u2019s best player (and Rose nemesis) in LeBron James \u2013 got sideways fast. In the Cavs\u2019 second game, on a drive to the rim, Rose got whacked across the face and neck by Milwaukee center Greg Monroe. He landed badly on the baseline, suffering a \u201cjacked-up\u201d left ankle that left him in a walking boot and sidelined him for 11 of Cleveland\u2019s next 15 games.  Then word got out just before Thanksgiving that Rose had left the team, reportedly to contemplate his future as an NBA player. He was gone for nearly two weeks, at least part of it back home in Chicago, during what Cavs GM Koby Altman called \u201ca very challenging and difficult time for Derrick.\u201d Rose didn\u2019t play again until Cleveland\u2019s 44th game. In nine appearances over the next three weeks, he was a shell of the three-time All-Star he\u2019d once been, averaging 6.3 points, 1.6 assists and 13.3 minutes, while shooting 39 percent. On Feb. 8, he was one of six Cavaliers players dealt by Altman at the NBA trade deadline, sent to Salt Lake City as a throw-in to acquire Utah\u2019s Rodney Hood and Sacramento\u2019s George Hill. Two days later, the Jazz waived Rose . Four weeks passed before Thibodeau got the green light from Minnesota owner Glen Taylor to sign Rose. The Oklahoma City Thunder had sniffed in his direction, only to opt for veteran backup Corey Brewer. Rose had family duties to attend to \u2013 he and Alaina Anderson had a baby girl in Chicago to start the week \u2013 but he also had spent time working out by himself in the Cavs\u2019 facility or at Cleveland State\u2019s gym. The end seemed near. Given Rose\u2019s limited involvement this season, he probably would have been a long shot to land with one of the league\u2019s 30 teams in 2018-19, had Thibodeau not reached out. The people on the dark end of Rose\u2019s rope were winning. Now, this buys him time for a shout-out to the folks on the other end. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t give up,\u2019 Rose said he would tell them. Talking later at the downtown Minneapolis hotel where he\u2019s staying, he wanted to assure people that his desire to play remains strong, his passion to keep trying still burns, and his mental fitness for this and future challenges on or away from the court is fine. \u201cI still have faith,\u201d Rose said, two bags of ice strapped to each leg. \u201cNo matter what happens, I still have a lot of faith in myself and my ability. It\u2019s just about opportunity and catching a rhythm. Whenever I do catch a rhythm, I\u2019d rather see what it is then. Than to, like, give up knowing I have so much left. Like, \u2018Damn, I should have kept playing.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m going to give it my all. And once I do, then it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, cool. I gave it my all, now what\u2019s this next phase in my life?\u2019 \u201cBut as far as right now, I\u2019m still in it. I\u2019ve got two kids that can look at me now. The oldest, my boy [P.J.] is 5 years old. He\u2019s looking at me right now. He sees everything. I\u2019m going to tell him, \u2018No excuses. Don\u2019t come to me cryin\u2019, this and that. Nah.\u2019 He\u2019ll see what I\u2019ve had to go through. \u2018Now suck it up and go out there and do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u2019\u201d For some NBA players whose careers got waylaid by injuries \u2013 Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Penny Hardaway \u2013 their bodies finally refused to cooperate. They went from 60-to-0, no wiggle room on whether they would continue. Rose, for all his setbacks, has worked his way back \u2013 not back to his previous form \u2013 from each and every injury. From the ACL blowout that started him down his hobbled path in April 2012 to three subsequent meniscus knee surgeries, from the left orbital fracture he suffered when he caught teammate Taj Gibson\u2019s errant elbow in the face in the opening practice of 2015-16 to the lingering ankle sprain dealt by Monroe\u2019s blow in October. In that sense, Rose is more like Bernard King, Sam Bowie or Grant Hill, standout players whose career trajectories were forever altered \u2013 but not ended \u2013 by injuries. Rose speaks as if he has reached some level of peace with his maladies, referring to his injuries as \u201cpart of the game\u201d and his particular \u201ccross\u201d to bear. \u201cI\u2019ve just had five surgeries more than other people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I look at it. That don\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t play. That don\u2019t mean that I lost my love for the game. No.\u201d What Rose doesn\u2019t like is the \u201cfragile\u201d label that\u2019s been affixed to him. He\u2019s less interested that he has played in only 486 of approximately 789 regular-season games so far, while proud of the 130 he logged with the Bulls (2015-16) and Knicks (2016-17) more recently. It seems clear that the reckless abandon with which Rose played \u2013 and the excruciating torque he put on his knees with his bounding, zig-zag attacks through the lane \u2013 wreaked havoc on his knees. Beyond that, though, he\u2019s not buying any pattern business. \u201cYou see how I was injured [in October]? I was taken out of the air,\u201d Rose said. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Aw, he\u2019s always injured.\u2019 Are you just watching highlights, just looking at clips, like new fans are these days? Or are you watching an entire game? Are you just reading reports that come up on your phone?\u201d Scouts say that Rose has lost both quickness and leaping ability, without developing a perimeter game to compensate. They also bundle his Cleveland hiatus with the AWOL episode last season with the Knicks , when Rose left the team without notice before a game against New Orleans, to question his reliability and commitment. Rose disputes the comments about his game, citing the circumstances in New York and Cleveland. \u201cI could sit here and tell you, \u2018I\u2019m gonna try to change this. Do this and do that.\u2019 Nah, I always felt, it starts with my rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201c[In] New York \u2026 I was playing the triangle [offense favored by former Knicks president Phil Jackson] and still playing pretty well [18.0 ppg, 4.4 apg, 32.5 mpg]. In Cleveland, when did I really have a chance to catch a rhythm? When did I play 20 games straight? Or 10 games? Five games?\u201d As for his reliability \u2013 or likelihood to take a powder on the Wolves the way he did on the Knicks and seemed to do on the Cavs \u2013 Rose said there is no issue there, either. In the past couple weeks, Toronto\u2019s DeMar DeRozan (depression) and Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love ( panic attacks ) have opened up about psychological challenges they and other athletes face. But Rose shook his head as the question was asked. \u201cOh no, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m blessed, man. Beyond blessed. It\u2019s not even \u2026 what do I have to complain about? I don\u2019t have anything to complain about. Of course, I wish I was on the court more. I think in time, with the right opportunity, I\u2019ll be out there more. \u201cI\u2019m not depressed, even though I think everybody deals with some depression in some way. It\u2019s about how you deal with it. We\u2019re emotional creatures. We hold onto things. I try to meditate, try to do little things to change my mindset and try to read things to easy my nerves.\u201d Rose admitted he did wonder if he would get another chance, once the Cavs traded him to a Jazz team that had no use for him. \u201cEspecially when you get dropped by a team like Cleveland, that needed players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes other teams think, \u2018Damn, if they didn\u2019t keep him\u2026\u2019\u201d Rose has not spoken with James since being dealt, he said. \u201cThe way I take it, I don\u2019t take it as personal,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need my services. That\u2019s the way I look at it, OK? I understand. It\u2019s business. Does that stop me from working hard? Does that stop me from still putting out goals and trying to reach my goals? No.\u201d Now Rose is reunited with Thibodeau, Gibson, Jimmy Butler (sidelined after his own meniscus surgery) and familiar coaches and staff making up the \u201cTimberBulls.\u201d He even trusts Thibodeau, often criticized for the heavy minutes he loads on his top players, not to break him. \u201cIf anything, I want him to play me,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI want to show to him that I can still play. I want him to see me and be like, \u2018Damn, he\u2019s still got it.\u2019 I want him to count on me. I want to be held accountable. You know what I mean? I don\u2019t just want to be, like, an average guy on the team riding along just to see how far they go. I really want to add.\u201d Said Thibodeau, who ran Rose Saturday through a rigorous refresher course on his playbook: \u201cObviously when he was at an MVP level, that was the peak. But he also, my last year in Chicago, he had a great year. \u2026 He still has the potential to be very good. He\u2019s young, that was the other part of it. He knows some of our guys, he knows the system. \u201cLike all stories, there\u2019s a beginning, there\u2019s a middle and there\u2019s an end,\u201d the Wolves coach added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a finished story.\u201d Gibson thinks Rose can shoulder some of Butler\u2019s late-game duties, simply because the scoring guard has strong muscle memory of such situations. He, too, hopes Rose\u2019s story can take a happy turn. \u201cI\u2019ve got my fingers crossed,\u201d the veteran forward said. \u201cI truly believe in him. He\u2019s got a lot left in the tank. It\u2019s just, sometimes life doesn\u2019t go your way and you have to push through it and keep fighting.\u201d Thibodeau has said that Rose, like starter Jeff Teague and backup Tyus Jones, can play both backcourt spots, so he can mix-and-match based on situations. Rose anticipates no problem walking that line between asserting his game and rocking the Wolves\u2019 boat. \u201cMy job coming here, I\u2019m not trying to step on nobody\u2019s toes. I\u2019m not trying to take someone\u2019s spot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to show myself. Nah. I\u2019m here to win. Me going out there and playing, hopefully you all see that. \u2018He\u2019s making money plays. He\u2019s playing to win. And that\u2019s what we wanted from him.\u2019\u201d Not that Rose, lest we forget from up top, needs anyone\u2019s bleeping validation. Boosters and doubters can pull this way or that, but he said he\u2019ll be the one who decides when his time is up. \u201cWhen my love of the game is not there,\u201d Rose said, sounding sincere near the end of his 10th season overall. \u201cWhen I get tired of going to the gym. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we all go through that. But after a couple of days, I get antsy, I want to be in the gym. When a week or two goes by and I haven\u2019t touched the gym, even in the summer, oh yeah, I\u2019d know it was over.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Leonard, a top three finisher in the past two Kia MVP voting and cornerstone of the Spurs\u2019 post-Tim Duncan era, has played in just nine of their 63 games this season while dealing with quadriceps tendinopathy in his right leg. The injury followed a sprained ankle that forced Leonard to miss all but the first game of the Spurs\u2019 4-0 loss to the Warriors in last season\u2019s Western Conference finals .  Leonard\u2019s return would bring an end to a seemingly endless saga, and one highly unusual for the usually drama-free Spurs. Leonard, the 2014 Finals MVP and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, was first revealed to be injured in training camp. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich would later say that he\u2019d never encountered an injury like Leonard\u2019s during a career stretching back to the early 1970s. Leonard finally made his season debut on Dec. 12, scoring 13 points in 15 minutes as the Spurs lost to the Mavericks . He saw limited action in eight of the next 16 games, averaging 16.2 points in 23.3 minutes, before returning to the sideline in early January. The Spurs have withered in his absence, dropping 13 of 20 games following Saturday\u2019s 104-94 loss to the Thunder \u2014 their worst stretch since 1996-97, the season before Duncan\u2019s arrival started a run of dominance featuring five championships and 20 straight playoff appearances. That streak is in danger as the Spurs sit just 1 game out of the eighth and final playoff berth in the West. More unusual still were the stream of stories surrounding Leonard\u2019s rehabilitation, with ESPN reporting that his relationship with the Spurs had \u201cchilled\u201d as the process wore on and Popovich saying last month that he\u2019d be \u201csurprised\u201d if Leonard returned this season.  But Leonard disputed those reports last week, asserting that he said he and the Spurs had always been on the same page during his rehab and that he \u201cfor sure\u201d hoped to finish his career in San Antonio. And now comes news of his imminent return, which the Spurs hope will resurrect their hopes of challenging the Rockets and defending champion Warriors for league supremacy.

Yet for one night, at least, they looked like world-beaters behind an amazing scoring performance from All-Star guard Tracy McGrady. On March 10, 2004, McGrady became the first player in more than four years to eclipse 60 points, going for a staggering 62 as the Magic posted a 108-99 victory over the Washington Wizards . He made 20-of-37 shots, including 5-of-14 from 3-point range, and 17-of-26 free throws, missing a chance at becoming just the then-fifth player to score 70. McGrady, who also had 10 rebounds and five assists, scored seven points in the first quarter, 21 in the second and 24 in the third. He hit 19 of his first 26 shots before going cold. \u201cMy teammates came to me and told me to get 60, then they told me to get 70,\u201d McGrady said, laughing, after the game. \u201cI was going for 70 and if I would have made my free throws, I would have had it. But this was a big night for me personally because it\u2019s been a long season. It\u2019s been a frustrating season, but this will give me a little boost.\u201d McGrady scored his 60th point on a free throw with 5:44 remaining. His previous career high was 52 points on February 21, 2003 against Chicago. Overall, McGrady\u2019s performance led to one of the Magic\u2019s 21 wins that season.

Portland was also resourceful enough to overcome a 40-point night from Kevin Durant and an additional 25 points from Klay Thompson.

No, today is the day the Raptors \u2013 the always-competent but never-contending Raptors \u2013 halted the seemingly unstoppable Houston Rockets for the second time this season (Toronto won 129-113) . More important than the win itself was how it happened. It was the mid-range-loving Raptors who out-shot the quick-trigger Rockets from 3-point range. It was Toronto that out-ran Houston in fast break points (19-14) and points off turnovers (26-12). It was Canada\u2019s team holding the lead for all but a couple moments in their 108-105 victory . By snapping the Rockets\u2019 17-game winning streak, the Raptors may just be ready to start a new perception of themselves: that they are and will be threats to make the NBA Finals. As the Rockets found out on Friday, Toronto has all the pieces to make it happen. DeMar DeRozan is a star . There is no getting around it, even if his career-high rate of 3-pointers taken (and made) pales in comparison to his flashier peers. Kyle Lowry is the ultimate floor general, setting the team\u2019s pulse with his playmaking and emotion. When DeRozan rested against Houston, it was Lowry reminding everyone why he has as many All-Star nods in a Raptors uniform (four) as his running mate. Continuity is an enormous asset come playoff time, and Toronto carries it in spades. DeRozan, Lowry, starting center Jonas Valanciunas and coach Dwane Casey have been together since 2012. Rookie swingman OG Anunoby is the only starter who was not with the team last year. It is not the familiar names who have provided the biggest difference this season. When the Raptors\u2019 heavy lifters falter, their reserves have proven capable of not only holding up the bridge, but strengthening its foundation. Against Houston on Friday, not one of Toronto\u2019s bench players boasted a negative on-court plus-minus while committing just four turnovers combined. They have added to a newfound versatility unlocked by Casey and embraced by Lowry and DeRozan. Such stability has allowed Toronto to rise above its more turbulent competition in Boston and Cleveland. They are in first place, with only the Celtics having a realistic shot of catching them. This is new territory for the Raptors. They have never owned a No. 1 seed in the playoffs, nor truly enjoyed the status of being a \u201cfavorite.\u201d They still may not be considered as such if they face a healthy Celtics or Cavaliers squad come Round 2 and\/or Round 3.

He wrote in his post, titled \u201cIn An Instant,\u201d that he \u201cimmediately\u201d knew the injury was severe. Throughout his recovery, Hayward has received a wellspring of support, including emails from Kobe Bryant and Barack Obama.

Sometimes it\u2019s simple arithmetic, as is the case with Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard . It\u2019s not that Lillard doesn\u2019t have the analytics on his side. He does. He\u2019s been on an absolute tear since Feb. 14, playing perhaps the best basketball of his career while averaging 33.1 points, 5.8 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game to push and shove his way into the MVP conversation in the final weeks of the race. Lillard\u2019s best and most compelling statement, however, might be the Trail Blazers\u2019 rise from the pack in a crowded Western Conference playoff chase into the top three heading into Friday night\u2019s win over the Golden State Warriors . Lillard, an Oakland native, popped his hometown team for 44 points and eight assists in a 123-117 win on Valentine\u2019s Day and the Trail Blazers haven\u2019t lost since, rattling off nine straight to join a group of elite teams in the top four of the Western Conference standings \u2014 the Houston Rockets, Warriors and New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 that had combined for a mind-boggling 42 straight wins between them. That the Trail Blazers are included in the group is remarkable, given their 2-4 start to February prior to that pivotal win over the Warriors. But if you\u2019ve watched Lillard work lately, maybe not. \u201cI said after I won Rookie of the Year, I said I think I can be MVP in this league,\u201d Lillard told reporters earlier this week. \u201cBeing in the discussion, it\u2019s an honor to be mentioned, but I don\u2019t look at that and think `Oh they mentioned me in the MVP discussion.\u2019 I feel that\u2019s the level of player I can be.\u201d He\u2019s scored 30 or more points five times during the streak, and had twice topped the 40-point mark . As always, he\u2019s been at his best when it matters most, showing out regularly with games on the line. \u201cDamian Lillard is special,\u201d Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said after Lillard scored 19 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter of Monday\u2019s comeback win over the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cIf it\u2019s not obvious, I\u2019ll say it.\u201d Lillard drained eight 3-pointers, one off his career-high, a night later in a win over New York that blew Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek away. \u201cThe guy is playing fantastic,\u201d Hornacek said. \u201cHe might be one of those guys you\u2019ve got to start talking about that MVP, too, with the way he\u2019s playing.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 21 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  30.9 points, 8.9 assists, 5.2 rebounds Harden and the Rockets put their sterling 17-game win streak on the line tonight at Air Canada Centre ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) in a best-on-best battle against the Toronto Raptors that is a must-watch. It\u2019s the sort of marquee matchup that has brought out the very best of Harden this season. Even with his 3-point shooting numbers taking a slight dip since the All-Star break (.333 in the seven games since compared to .384 in the 50 games before) Harden continues to generate offense at will for himself and everyone else. It certainly helps to have another elite point guard in Chris Paul rolling with him. They\u2019re averaging a shade under 50 points and 17 assists combined, which should come in handy with Toronto\u2019s All-Star backcourt of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry just as eager for tonight\u2019s superstar matchup. The truth is the Rockets have been the undisputed best in the business for a while now ( 24-2 since Jan. 8th and a ridiculous 34-1 with Harden, Paul and Clint Capela in the lineup this season). It all starts and ends with Harden playing at a MVP-level from the the opening tip of opening night and all the way through to the finish. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.0 points, 9.0 assists, 8.4 rebounds The Cavaliers finally knocked off a team with a .500 or better record Wednesday in Denver, thanks in large part to LeBron\u2019s finishing kick ( he scored Cleveland\u2019s final nine points on 4-for-4 shooting ). He finished with 39 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, collecting his 24th game of the season with 30 or more points. There is a reason LeBron does not fear the competition in the Eastern Conference playoff field, not after seven straight seasons of smoking the competition when it matters most. No matter what the Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics or any other team brings to the party, he knows he\u2019s the most impactful player on the floor every single night. (There\u2019s a reason fans in Philadelphia and Los Angeles have already ramped up their recruiting efforts in advance of this summer\u2019s sure-to-be-crazy free-agent frenzy.) That said, LeBron still has some work to do fine-tuning things with the deadline additions ( Larry Nance Jr. in the starting lineup now ) and the eventual return of All-Star power forward Kevin Love at some point. There is still plenty of room for improvement and time to get it done. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  25.9 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.4 assists Durant was at his MVP-best in the Warriors\u2019 comeback win over the San Antonio Spurs Thursday night . He scored a game-high 37 points, including 14 straight down the stretch, to carry the Warriors back from an eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter. He shot 14-for-26 from the floor, 4-for-7 from deep and added 11 rebounds, four assists and four blocks on a night when Stephen Curry was lost for the night in the first quarter with another sprained ankle and both Andre Iguodala and David West were already out of the lineup nursing injuries. With Curry already ruled out for tonight\u2019s matchup against a surging Portland team at the Moda Center, the Warriors will need much more of the same from Durant, who is averaging 39 points on .538 shooting this season vs. Portland . Durant\u2019s well positioned to make a late-season push in this race, but the Warriors have more pressing matters trying to catch the Houston Rockets in the race for No. 1 in the Western Conference. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  26.7 points, 6.4 assists, 5.3 rebounds DeRozan put on a show (42 points, six assists) in Wednesday\u2019s win against Detroit , the Raptors\u2019 sixth straight win and the All-Star\u2019s fourth 40-point game of the season. DeRozan is averaging 25 points on .510 shooting during that streak, which is on the line tonight at Air Canada Centre with the Houston Rockets (17 straight wins of their own) visiting for a showdown between the league\u2019s top two teams in the standings. The Raptors have won 13 of their last 14 games, and continue to thrive when DeRozan has it going offensively (they are 13-2 this season when he scores 30 or more points ). And yet it was his playmaking, as well his scoring prowess, that helped the Raptors become the first team in the league to clinch a playoff berth with that win over the Pistons. His final assist in that game came when he drove in, collapsed the defense and found Fred VanVleet on the baseline for what turned out to be the game-winning jumper . His trust in his teammates, regardless of their status, is one of the key ingredients in the Raptors\u2019 success. Coach Dwane Casey\u2019s revamping of the offense wouldn\u2019t have been possible without a complete buy in from both members (Kyle Lowry, of course, being the other) of his All-Star backcourt. And it\u2019s clear that they are all in. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  28.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.3 blocks A tender left ankle will do what no team in the league has been able to for the last month: slow Davis down. He\u2019s listed as doubtful for tonight\u2019s critical showdown against the Washington Wizards. (They\u2019re all critical, though, when seemingly every team in the Western Conference is on a winning streak.) Prior to going down in the third quarter of Wednesday\u2019s win over Sacramento, Davis was averaging 37.7 points, 14.6 rebounds, 2.9 blocks and 2.9 steals while playing a 39.3 minutes. As impressive as Davis has been offensively during the Pelicans\u2019 nine-game win streak , he\u2019s been equally if not perhaps even more impressive since the All-Star break as a the two-way monster he\u2019s always been, when healthy. His 13.4 rebounds, 3.4 blocks and 2.6 steals show off the click-every-box abilities of the man who can legitimately claim the title of the \u201cbest big man\u201d in basketball. The Pelicans\u2019 current 10-game win-streak has served as the ultimate confirmation of exactly where Davis belongs in the pecking order of the league\u2019s uber elite. 6. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 7. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 8. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 9. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks And five more:  LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers An inside look at Derrick Rose from an Eastern Conference executive: \u201cI have no idea if there is any of that magic left in his body. But if anyone can get it out of him, if anybody can push Derrick in all the right ways, it\u2019s [Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau]. Their bond has always been strong. Thibs helped build Derrick into the MVP he was before his body betrayed him and all of his issues began. So they have that history, that connection. And Derrick trusts him. He trusts what Thibs will do with him for the remainder of what has been a trying season. And I have to admit, I want to see Derrick get one more shot to see if he can at least be a contributor on a solid, playoff team. He got robbed of that opportunity with the trade from Cleveland, which I didn\u2019t think was a very good fit for him in the first place. He was never going to be an ideal fit alongside LeBron. \u201cPhysically, he\u2019s nowhere near the player he once was. We all see that. That\u2019s had to be a hell of reality to face for someone who was on top of the world just a few years ago. Anyone hoping for or expecting some miracle revival from him is dreaming. I just don\u2019t see it happening. Not this season. Not ever. He\u2019s never going to be the player he was before his injuries. Because as much as people talk about Russell Westbrook being the most physically explosive point guard that they have seen, they are forgetting how crazy, off-the-charts Derrick was at his zenith. He was unreal. Now he has to dig in, carve out a role for himself in Minnesota the rest of the way and show us that he can contribute the way you need a veteran to in that situation. Finding a way to play meaningful minutes, even if they aren\u2019t many, will go a long way. It\u2019s going to tell us if there is a role for him beyond this season somewhere, in the right spot, where he\u2019s maybe that veteran backup point guard you need.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Rose has signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves in a move that reunites the 2011 NBA MVP with three mainstays from his days in Chicago \u2013 coach Tom Thibodeau, as well as Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson. The Timberwolves did not release the terms, but a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that the deal is for the remainder of the season. Rose may debut as early as Thursday night, when Minnesota plays host to Boston. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m missing now is the opportunity,\u201d Rose told reporters in Minnesota on Thursday. \u201cTalking to Thibs, he sounds like he\u2019s going to give me the opportunity, so it\u2019s all about learning the guys and fitting in at the right time.\u201d Minnesota will be the fourth team Rose plays for, and technically his fourth franchise in the last 11 months. Rose spent his first eight NBA years in Chicago, five of those with Thibodeau as his coach. He was with New York last season and started this season with Cleveland, but appeared in only 16 games with the Cavaliers largely because of injuries. \u201cWe just thought he could help the team,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our expectations are: come in, be a good teammate, try to help us win. \u2026 He\u2019s been around, he\u2019s been in a lot of games.

So that\u2019s a plus.\u201d The Cavaliers traded the former All-Star to Utah last month as part of the massive restructuring of their team, and the Jazz waived him shortly afterward. Rose has been working out since, and this week became a father again \u2013 just three days before completing the deal with the Timberwolves, who were willing to wait for his new daughter to arrive before asking him to make the move. \u201cI think I\u2019m familiar with a lot of guys that\u2019s here,\u201d Rose said. \u201cJust staying ready and coming here and trying to make it to the playoffs and I feel like I can help in some way.\u201d Miami guard Dwyane Wade, who was teammates with Rose earlier this season in Cleveland, said he expected Rose and Thibodeau would reunite \u2013 and insisted the 29-year-old guard still, when healthy, can be elite. \u201cHe was the best player in training camp,\u201d Wade said, noting that LeBron James was hurt for most of Cavs camp last fall. \u201cIt\u2019s always been about health with D-Rose.\u201d Rose took some time off earlier this season to evaluate his options. He\u2019s joining a Timberwolves team bidding for its first postseason trip since 2004, and entered play Thursday holding the sixth seed in a very close Western Conference race \u2013 where four games separate the eight teams from third place to 10th. He said he isn\u2019t worried about role, and said he can fit in alongside fellow Wolves point guards Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones. \u201cI think I can play with anybody, to tell you the truth,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI know the game. I\u2019m not a selfish player. I\u2019m not here for stats or anything like that.

ESPN\u2019s Jackie MacMullan recently caught up with Bosh to discuss his life away from the game, the challenges of moving on from a regimented NBA life and his hopes for playing again in the league. In the interview, Bosh says he realizes the odds of an NBA return are stacked against him somewhat and how the league\u2019s ruling that his blot-clotting issue was \u201ccareer ending.\u201d Still, Bosh remains hopeful he can take one last run at being on an NBA roster in the future : In an interview on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d in late February, Bosh said he understands the concerns surrounding his condition and would not put himself in life-threatening danger. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in a position where I\u2019m risking my life,\u201d Bosh said in the February \u201cFirst Take\u201d interview. \u201cSo if I ever get back on the court like that and people are worried, it\u2019s not going to be a life-risking situation.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Bosh has cited a desire to return to the NBA. In November, Bosh said he planned to \u201ckeep [his] options open as a player moving forward.\u201d  Bosh appeared in 44 games in 2014-15, his season ending at the All-Star break when the first known clot episode started . A year later, he played in 53 games and his season again ended at All-Star weekend , when another clot was found shortly after he landed in Toronto for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. Overall, he played 13 NBA seasons, seven with Toronto and six with the Miami Heat. He averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds in his career."},{"id":47480,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/derrick-rose-minnesota-timberwolves-report","date":"2018-03-08","title":"Derrick Rose signs deal with Minnesota Timberwolves","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Celtics vs. Timberwolves (8 ET) Former Kia MVP Derrick Rose has signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves, the team announced today. The news was first reported by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN , who says that Rose is signed with the Wolves for the remainder of the season. The move reunites Rose with former teammates Taj Gibson and Jimmy Butler as well as coach Tom Thibodeau. According to Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic, Rose and his wife welcomed a new baby earlier this week and Rose held off on signing with the Wolves until after the baby arrived. After Thursday\u2019s shootaround, Rose told reporters he is ready to play tonight against Boston, but is deferring on that decision to Thibodeau. As to whether or not Thibodeau is the best coach for him at this stage of his career, Rose said: \u201cWho knows? So far he has been the best coach, but I still think I got a lot left. Who knows if he can spark something up\u2026I don\u2019t have to prove anything. I\u2019m going to let my hard work do that. \u201cI\u2019m wholeheartedly invested, even though I just got here. I just want to have the opportunity to show I can still play.\u201d Rose was waived by the Utah Jazz on Feb. 10 after the team acquired him in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Feb. 8 . Since Rose was waived before March 1, he is eligible to join the Timberwolves\u2019 playoff roster. Thibodeau coached Rose in Chicago from 2010-15 and Rose\u2019s best season came in 2010-11, when he became the youngest player to win the NBA MVP award. That season, Rose averaged 25.0 points and 7.7 assists while leading the Chicago Bulls to the best record in the NBA and the Eastern Conference finals. Rose averaged 9.8 points and 1.6 assists on 43.9 percent shooting in 16 games with the Cavaliers this season."},{"id":41444,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/west-playoff-race-breakdown","date":"2018-03-08","title":"Playoff race breakdown: Trends, tiebreakers and future schedules in wild West","content":" The second- and third-longest active playoff streaks are coming to an end this season. The Atlanta Hawks have made the playoffs in each of the last 10 seasons , while the Memphis Grizzlies have done it in each of the last seven . Currently, those two teams sit in last place in their respective conferences . The fourth-longest active streak, the six-year run belonging to the LA Clippers , is also in danger of coming to an end. But just how safe is the the *third longest playoff streak in NBA history? The San Antonio Spurs have reached the postseason in each of the last 20 seasons and currently sit in fifth place in the Western Conference. * The record belongs to the Philadelphia 76ers, who were in the postseason in each of their first 22 seasons (14 as the Syracuse Nationals), from 1950-71 . The second longest streak (21 seasons) belongs to the Portland Trail Blazers ( 1983-2003 ). In fifth place, the Spurs are just three games in the loss column ahead of the ninth-place Denver Nuggets. The Spurs are 3-8 since Feb. 1 , they\u2019ve lost seven of their last eight games against teams that currently have winning records, and they\u2019ll be playing a lot more of those teams over the final five weeks of the season. In regard to opponent strength, the Spurs have the league\u2019s toughest remaining schedule, with 15 of their 18 remaining games against teams that currently have winning records. One of the other games is on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers, who are 18-8 over the last two months and just beat the Spurs (in San Antonio) on Saturday . The Spurs have four games remaining (two apiece) against the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets. The first of those is Thursday in Oakland, the second game of Thursday\u2019s TNT double-header ( 10:30 p.m. ET ). * Schuhmann:  Critical time in East playoff chase, too Trying to figure out if the Spurs could possibly miss the playoffs requires predicting what\u2019s going to happen in the 113 games remaining that involve the eight teams currently sitting between third and 10th place in the West. The playoff picture in the Western Conference is a wild scrum and making sense of it is probably an impossible task. We\u2019ll do our best \u2026 If the standings were based on per-game point differential, the Spurs would still be in third place in the West . They\u2019re 37-27 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 40-24. The Oklahoma City Thunder (37-29 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 40-26), Utah Jazz (35-30 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 38-27) and Minnesota Timberwolves (38-28 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 40-26) have also been better than their record. The New Orleans Pelicans (38-26 with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 34-30) are on the opposite end of the spectrum. If you take the records of these eight teams (the games they\u2019ve won so far) and use their point differentials to project how they\u2019ll do over the final five weeks of the season (ignoring strength of schedule), we\u2019d have a three-way tie for fourth place, the Jazz would grab the No. 8 seed, and the Nuggets and Clippers would be heading to the Lottery \u2026  The Portland Trail Blazers have won eight straight games to climb from sixth to third in the West. The New Orleans Pelicans have won 10 straight games to climb from ninth to fourth. The Blazers have ranked second defensively over the course of their streak , allowing just 97 points per 100 possessions. The streak includes wins over the No. 1 and No. 3-ranked offenses, though the Timberwolves (the No. 3 offense) were without Jimmy Butler and the streak includes twice as many wins over bottom-10 offenses (four) as top-10 offenses (two). But while the defensive numbers need that context, the streak still includes wins over the Warriors, Jazz (ending their 11-game winning streak), Wolves and Thunder. The Pelicans have been more balanced, with the eighth-ranked offense and seventh-ranked defense over the course of their streak, which includes seven road wins. But only four of the 10 wins have been over teams with winning records and the best of those opponents was the Spurs, who have not been playing well of late. So the Pelicans\u2019 streak is longer, but over their streak, the Blazers have beat tougher opponents on average. Both teams are home for most of the next two weeks, but the Blazers host the Warriors again on Friday and Anthony Davis\u2019 ankle injury (suffered in their win in Sacramento on Wednesday ) could derail the Pelicans.  While the Blazers and Pelicans are two of the four West teams that haven\u2019t lost since the All-Star break , the Nuggets (3-4), Wolves (2-3) and Spurs (2-3) are three of the seven West teams with losing records since the break. Minnesota (from fourth to sixth) and San Antonio (from third to fifth) have each slipped two spots in the standings since the break, going from having home-court advantage in the first round to playing Game 1 on the road. The Nuggets, meanwhile, have slipped from sixth to ninth. There\u2019s plenty of time to recover, but the Wolves could be without Jimmy Butler for the rest of the regular season . They\u2019re 4-6 without him, with the numbers of the league\u2019s worst defense (114 points allowed per 100 possessions) in those 10 games. In this latest absence , they\u2019ve been able to beat the two bad teams they\u2019ve played (Chicago and Sacramento), but they\u2019ve lost important games in Portland and in Utah. The Nuggets beat the Spurs in their first game out of the break, but have since lost four of their last six , losing at home to the Clippers in a game they led by 19 points in the third quarter, and losing to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday. Denver ranks last defensively (115 points allowed per 100 possessions) since Feb. 1 . The Spurs still rank second defensively overall , but 17th since Feb. 1. Their offense has been inconsistent all season and it\u2019s still not clear if and when they\u2019ll get Kawhi Leonard back. The Blazers have a relatively tough schedule in regard to opponent strength, with 13 of their final 17 games against teams with winning records, including three games against Golden State and Houston. They\u2019ll also play five of their seven remaining games within this group on the road. So that 3 seed is far from sewn up. The Pelicans have the most home-heavy remaining schedule in the league, with 12 of their final 18 games at the Smoothie King Center. That includes four of their six remaining games against the other seven teams in this group. But location hasn\u2019t meant much to the Pels this season. They have both a better record and a better point differential on the road (21-14, plus-1.2 per game) than at home (17-12, plus-0.7) . As noted above, the Spurs have the league\u2019s toughest remaining schedule, with 15 of their 18 games against teams with winning records and another against the improved Lakers. And Thursday\u2019s game at Golden State is just the start of a three-game trip that also includes visits to Oklahoma City (Saturday) and Houston (Monday). But that\u2019s followed by a six-game homestand, in which they\u2019ll host important games against the Pelicans, Wolves and Jazz, with a *rest advantage against Utah. * Rest advantage = When your opponent played the day before, but you did not. Over the last two seasons, home teams are 290-159 (.646) with a rest advantage and road teams are 86-82 (.512) with a rest advantage. The Timberwolves have one of the easier remaining schedules in the West, as well as more games at home than on the road, where they are 2-13 in 2018 . But we\u2019re going to know a lot about their ability to hang on without Butler in the next two weeks, because they play their next six games against teams with winning records. The Thunder have the group\u2019s fifth toughest schedule in regard to opponent strength, but after they play three of their next four games against teams with losing records, they\u2019ll play 11 straight against teams currently over .500, a stretch that includes visits to Toronto, Boston and Houston. They will play four of their six remaining games within this group (including Saturday\u2019s game against the Spurs) at home. The Clippers have a similarly tough schedule, with 15 of their 19 remaining games against teams with winning records, as well as a game against those Lakers (on the last night of the season). The Clips have just one game remaining against the top two teams in the West (at Houston next Thursday), but also visit the Toronto Raptors, who have the league\u2019s best home record , as they play nine of 11 on the road from March 13-30. The Nuggets have the most road-heavy remaining schedule of the group, with 10 of their final 17 games on the road and a seven-game, 14-day trip starting March 17. And among these teams, playing a home has been most important to the Nuggets, who have been 8.9 points per 100 possessions better at the Pepsi Center (plus-4.3) than they\u2019ve been on the road (minus-4.6) . But the Nuggets have a relatively easy schedule in regard to opponent strength. And the time to turn things around is right now. Denver will play six of its next seven games against teams that are currently under .500 (though that includes two games against the Lakers), before finishing the season with 10 straight games against teams that currently have winning records. The Jazz are one of two Western Conference teams (Dallas is the other) with more games remaining against teams that are under .500 (nine) than against teams that are over .500 (eight). They\u2019ve won their last eight games against the bad teams. The Jazz have nine of their 17 remaining games at home, but four of their five remaining games against the other teams within this group are on the road. Of course, while they still have the league\u2019s sixth biggest home-road NetRtg differential ( 7.2 points per 100 possessions ), the Jazz have won nine straight on the road . Also, their final game against the Clippers (April 5) is in Utah, and a win would clinch the tiebreaker against the Clips. There are 28 season series between these eight teams. And 11 of the head-to-head tiebreakers have been determined, with each of the eight teams having clinched at least one\u2026 Also, though the Jazz could tie the season series when they play in Minnesota on April 1, the Wolves have clinched that tiebreaker, because Utah (6-8 within the Northwest Division) can\u2019t catch Minnesota (9-4) in division record. Three more series are done with no head-to-head tiebreaker determined, because the teams split their four games \u2026 So the tiebreaker is still yet to be determined in 13 of the 28 matchups, and there are still 25 remaining games between the eight teams, starting with Spurs-Thunder on Saturday. Below are the seven head-to-head games in the next two weeks (through March 22), a critical stretch for both the Spurs and Clippers, who each play in three of the seven games. The Nuggets are the only team that isn\u2019t involved, as they\u2019re about to play five straight games against teams with losing records \u2026 (RA) \u2013 Rest advantage After head-to-head, the next tiebreaker is division winner over non-division winner. The Rockets and Warriors are set to win the Southwest and Pacific Divisions, respectively, but the door is open for one of the five Northwest Division teams to grab a tiebreaker over the Clippers, Pelicans or Spurs if that particular series finished with a 2-2 tie. In a tiebreaker determined by conference record, the Wolves would likely have an edge over every other team, because they have the worst record (10-15) among the group against the Eastern Conference . * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Six weeks earlier, the certain first-round NBA Draft pick had roughed up the Aztecs for a school-record 44 points, making 15 of 21 shots from the floor and 7-for-10 from 3-point range in an 84-81 victory. When the Mountain West Conference adversaries played again in San Diego, suffice it to say the Aztecs weren\u2019t going to let Hutchison go off again. They double-teamed him constantly, and the three other players who weren\u2019t specifically assigned to shadow Hutchison kept close tabs on him, too. \u201cEvery time he got the ball there were five sets of eyes on him, and that makes it tough,\u201d Boise State coach Leon Rice said after the game. Not surprisingly, Hutchison made just 4-for-14 from the floor and Boise State lost 72-64. There were several other sets of eyes on Hutchison that night \u2014 34 NBA scouts attended the game. And though San Diego State\u2019s suffocating defense meant the scouts weren\u2019t treated to Hutchison\u2019s best offensive work \u2014 he scored 18 points with the help of a 10-for-15 effort at the free-throw line \u2014 they nevertheless saw plenty to fill their notebooks. Once again displaying the versatility that attracted that much NBA attention in the first place, Hutchison contributed nine rebounds, five assists and a steal. Hutchison has come a long way in two years, when Rice, after Hutchison\u2019s underwhelming sophomore season, scribbled in a notebook that he was making it a priority to help the player \u201cdiscover his hidden treasures.\u201d Rice laughs at the recollection of that particular journal entry. \u201cYou never know what [players] see in themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I saw in him. I saw that he had all these tools to reach the potential that he\u2019s reached now. Oh my God, it\u2019s all there. He had all these things that you can\u2019t teach. I felt like if we could teach him some other things that he didn\u2019t have, we\u2019d have something special.\u201d Rice had a plan to help Hutchinson tap into that potential. Over the years he had become friends with Phil Beckner, who, as an assistant coach at Weber State, was credited with helping turn Damian Lillard into a lottery pick and NBA star. Rice wanted Beckner \u2014 who by then was working in player development for the Oklahoma City Thunder \u2014 to join his staff. His sales pitch was irresistible to an X and O, workout junkie like Beckner. Rice had another Lillard in the rough in Hutchison \u2014 a long, athletic, cerebral player who needed some fine-tuning and the motivation to make changes in order to realize his potential and become a star. Beckner jumped at the opportunity. He recalls his first workout session with Hutchison. \u201cI saw a kid oozing with potential,\u201d Beckner said. \u201cHe had so many tools and so many gifts that hadn\u2019t been tapped into yet. What I saw was this big, tall, long athletic kid who was ready to be molded into a great player.\u201d Hutchison\u2019s recollection of that day differs a bit, more than likely because of the culture shock he experienced. Not that Rice, a disciple of Gonzaga coach Mark Few and a good coach in his own right, hadn\u2019t put Hutchison through his paces. But this was different. \u201cI\u2019d just met [Beckner], and he\u2019s telling me I\u2019ve got to do this and do that,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, hold up, who is this guy? Is what he\u2019s telling me to do going to work?\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for Hutchison and Beckner to bond, and once trust had been established, Hutchison was ready to go to work. He developed what he called a \u201cno choice,\u201d mindset. In other words, Hutchison had no Plan B. It was the NBA or bust. Beckner noticed early that Hutchison\u2019s work ethic wasn\u2019t where it needed to be, not if he wanted to play in the NBA. Once Hutchison made that commitment to do whatever it took, Beckner developed a plan. \u201cHe was skinny kid,\u201d Beckner said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play with a lot of force. So we worked on strength of force and movement with his footwork and ball handling. We mastered finishing around the basket. And then the other component, which you\u2019re seeing this year, he\u2019s become a better shooter.\u201d Hutchison made a huge jump from his sophomore year \u2014 when he averaged 6.8 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists and shot .231 percent from 3 \u2014 to his junior season, when those numbers climbed to 17.4, 7.8, 2.6 and .377. In 2017-18, Hutchison had continued to make subtle improvements. His scoring average is up (19.8), but so are his assists (3.5). \u201cThe rate he improves at is unbelievable,\u201d Beckner said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done in two years is crazy.\u201d Beckner points to a play Hutchison made in a 73-71 win at New Mexico in early February as evidence that total transformation has been achieved. Boise State had to rally in the second half, but Hutchison didn\u2019t feel compelled to be a one-man show. Late in the game, he moved around a high ball screen, but instead of driving into a couple of Lobo defenders, he spotted teammate Chris Sengfelder, a 6-foot-9, 246-pound power forward, alone at the 3-point line and threw him a crisp pass. Sengfelder, a .381 3-point shooter, jumped up and made a critical basket. \u201cChandler could have forced it to the rack, but he had three bodies in front of him,\u201d Beckner said. \u201cHe\u2019s seeing that, every night, the whole defense is loaded up to stop him. So instead of making the wrong play, he made the right play. If we don\u2019t hit that 3, we don\u2019t win the game.\u201d Plays like that are what have endeared Hutchison to scouts. He doesn\u2019t project to a limited role in the NBA. He\u2019s got the entire package. \u201cHe\u2019s got great size and a point guard\u2019s feel for the game,\u201d Rice said. \u201cPeople are surprised that he\u2019s bigger than they think when they stand next to him. That kind of size, coupled with feel, add in his other skills \u2026 everybody [NBA scouts] loves him.\u201d Hutchison\u2019s work with Beckner has provided an added benefit. During the summer, he gets to train with Lillard, and witness, as Beckner puts it, what it\u2019s like to be a \u201cfreak worker.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got some things in common, both being from mid-major schools\u201d Hutchison said of Lillard. \u201cHe had to outwork a bunch of guys that were maybe recruited above him or got more hype than him. There are things I\u2019ve taken away from being around him\u2014how hard he works, his outlook on the game, on life. Seeing how he carries himself in everything he does, every decision he makes, even how he talks. He\u2019s just a complete professional. \u201cI\u2019ve got so much respect for him. He\u2019s shown me that, to get to where you want to go, you\u2019ve got to put the time in. You\u2019ve got to be willing to outwork everybody else. When I say I have no choice, I really mean it. This is the path I\u2019m on. I have no other choice.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Nice, but largely irrelevant. \u201cLot of years in the league,\u201d was Horford\u2019s go-to line after the Boston Celtics dismantled the rebuilding Chicago Bulls at United Center . \u201cYear 11. That\u2019s what happens when you play a lot of years.\u201d Horford sat down for the last time against Chicago with 4:07 left in the third quarter and his team leading by 37 points. He was a plus-31 in the game and became one of 16 active players to reach 10,000 points while averaging no more than 11.4 field-goal attempts. He\u2019s also the 14th in NBA history among players who were named to at least five All-Star teams. Horford and the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Dwight Howard are the only two active players on that list. That economy of impact \u2014 scoring when needed, as part of an overall game \u2014 illustrates the value Horford has brought since his rookie season with the Atlanta Hawks in 2007-08. But it never has been more apparent than in the 146 games, regular and postseason, he has played for the Celtics since signing a four-year, $113 million free-agent deal with them in July 2016. That seemed awfully pricey for a guy who had averaged more than 18 points or 10 rebounds once each in his first nine seasons. But Boston improved from 48 victories and a first-round exit in 2015-16 to 53 and the Eastern Conference finals last season. This time, the Celtics are on pace to win 57, with playoff ambitions to match or top 2017\u2019s. At 12.8 points per game, Horford (who has scored 20 or more 10 times this season) only ranks fourth among Celtics scorers, averaging barely half of Kyrie Irving\u2019s 24.8 ppg. But it was that way a year ago, too, with Isaiah Thomas at 28.9 ppg and Horford at 14.0 ppg. In fact, one can make the case that Horford prefers it so, allowing him to contribute in a multitude of ways while still commanding respect from opposing defenses \u2014 and obviously, All-Star reserve votes from the conference\u2019s coaches. His net rating is 7.1, compared to Irving\u2019s 4.9. \u201cIf Al is open, we\u2019re going to get him the ball,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cIf Al is at the rim, we want to get him the ball. But Al is also OK being a facilitator and making plays for everybody else. \u201cAl is a lot more concerned with how our team plays than his stat line.\u201d Even when Horford strung together some meager stats lines after the All-Star break \u2014 three points at Detroit, five points each against Memphis and Charlotte \u2014 Boston still won. It is 5-1 since the break, 2 1\/2 games behind the Toronto Raptors for top spot in the East \u2026 and 6 1\/2 in front of third-place Cleveland. Those are the sort of numbers that get Horford\u2019s attention. \u201cI came to Boston for the opportunity to compete for a championship,\u201d he said on his way out of United Center. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re winning, that\u2019s what I care about. It\u2019s always been that way with me, but it\u2019s even more true now. \u201cKyrie\u2019s the leader of our team, the head of our team. And for me, it\u2019s just to make sure I\u2019m making things easy for him. Then when the team needs me to step up and score, I will. Otherwise I need to just defend.\u201d Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 Horford can exploit defensive mismatches and lapses, and rise to the proper occasion (he had 21 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists in Game 1 of the 2017 Eastern Conference semifinals and 15-6-5 in the Game 7 clincher). But there are a dozen other things Horford does in the seams, on and especially off the court, to help steer the Celtics. Not the least of which is his presence as a grown-up in the room, so often underrated in this league. Horford was old beyond his years, a calming voice in Atlanta\u2019s 74 playoff games from 2008-16. He\u2019s that guy again, only more so. Consider Celtics guard Marcus Smart\u2019s appreciation of Horford\u2019s counsel. \u201cThis season for me has been up and down,\u201d Smart said. \u201cInjuries and things like that. He\u2019s just always been there. Always positive. You need that when you go through hard times. He\u2019s been coaching up our rookies, helping them along the way. It\u2019s tough being a rookie, especially on a good team. You get thrown into the fire, you need somebody like Al there to help you.\u201d Teammate Marcus Morris referred to Horford as \u201cthe ultimate vet.\u201d But like Smart, he didn\u2019t know much previously about Horford\u2019s personality or character. To Morris, Horford seemed a fairly non-descript opponent. It wasn\u2019t until Horford signed with Boston that Smart got to know him, with Morris getting a better glimpse since his trade from Detroit last summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny is, he\u2019s kind of a quiet guy,\u201d Smart said. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t really expecting much. [As an opponent] you couldn\u2019t really tell. But now that he\u2019s on my team, you can see all the things he brings. His work ethic, and why he\u2019s been in the league so long.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Cleveland needed a major facelift at the trade deadline and got it, and the Cavaliers and their fans were delighted. Then some harsh reality set in after the All-Star break (mostly defensively) and the new toys didn\u2019t seem quite as shiny. As with most toys, though, the fun comes from imagination in using them, and that\u2019s what coach Tyronn Lue had forced on him by Thompson\u2019s ankle injury. LeBron James and Nance Jr. have some chemistry on the court, fueled by the new guy\u2019s liveliness. Long-term, the Cavs\u2019 need for sugar rushes might not serve them so well through a long, grueling postseason but for now, Nance Jr. starting at center is what they need. Tas Melas :  Better but worse. Thompson needs to eat minutes in the Cavs\u2019 thin frontcourt rotation and despite Nance Jr.\u2019s good play, those minutes are better served as a starter. He is a true center, pushing Kevin Love to his proper spot at the 4, he\u2019s a vet who has started 54 straight playoff games with LeBron (LeBron loves his vets), and he achieves more with better players. Thompson wouldn\u2019t be as good off the bench \u2014 where Nance Jr. thrives \u2014 and Nance Jr. can finish games if the matchup dictates. Shaun Powell : More athletic and exciting. He\u2019s simply the hungrier player right now on multiple levels. He hasn\u2019t gotten paid yet and is still trying to establish himself in the league. Plus, he hasn\u2019t reached his full potential. He\u2019s a consistent jump shot away from being a very good player. Thompson seems to be missing something; his impact games are becoming more scarce. He also hasn\u2019t evolved as a player or erased any of his weaknesses. His head has touched his ceiling and there\u2019s only one way to go from here. John Schuhmann :  Better. Thompson\u2019s primary job is to be an impact defender, and he hasn\u2019t been that this season. The Cavs have ranked in the bottom five defensively all season, and Thompson\u2019s rim protection numbers ( opponents have shot 70 percent at the rim when he\u2019s been there to protect it ) have been much worse than they\u2019ve been in previous seasons ( 60 percent in 2014-15 , 58 percent in \u201915-16 , and 55 percent last season ). Nance was part of a top-12 defense in L.A. and over the nine games with their new players, the Cavs have almost 17 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Nance on the floor than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor . That number might go down with him in the starting lineup, but it will be interesting to see how well the Cavs defend going forward and which one of these guys sees more playing time in the postseason with Kevin Love healthy.  Sekou Smith :  Fun and clearly more active above the rim, but still flawed. It\u2019s not a knock on Nance Jr., who has done nothing but play his role to perfection since the trade deadline. The Cavaliers simply have issues bigger than any one man, particularly one who has played a grand total of nine games with Cleveland. I won\u2019t know what his impact could be, for sure, until Kevin Love returns. Then, and only then, will we have a clear understanding of what sort of impact Nance Jr. will have on the Cavaliers and their quest to return to The Finals for a fourth straight season. I won\u2019t go off the deep end pointing out the difference in the Thompson we see now compared to the energy big who was critical to the Cavaliers\u2019 cause in previous seasons. Plus, he\u2019s dealing with aches and pains right now that clearly have impacted his performance. Nance Jr. is just a better option, for now, on so many different levels. * * *"},{"id":47090,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-kevin-durant-james-harden-russell-westbrook-mvps-okc-thunder","date":"2018-03-07","title":"Blogtable: Would Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook have earned MVPs in Oklahoma City?","content":" * * * Former Oklahoma City Thunder teammates Kevin Durant , Russell Westbrook and James Harden could all have Kia MVP trophies after this season. That still could have happened if they had stayed together, right?  * * * Steve Aschburner : No, it wouldn\u2019t have happened and this question raises a good point. In a league that has half as many superstars as it has franchises, it is a good thing when elite players seek out (or wind up on) their \u201cown\u201d teams and spread the talent around. That\u2019s why Harden blossoming as an MVP candidate and future Hall of Famer in ways he might not have had he stayed with the Thunder has been a boost not just to the Houston Rockets, but also to the league. It\u2019s why people are intrigued, for instance, about Klay Thompson\u2019s ability to be an A-lister elsewhere rather than a third- or fourth-wheel with Golden State. It\u2019s also why Durant joining the \u201c1-percenter\u201d Warriors irritated and annoyed so many. That said, we got teased with that original OKC3 in the 2012 Finals , then saw them pre-empted before they ever reached their potential. That, too, is something for which NBA fans root.  Tas Melas :  More playoff success sticking together? Sure. More individual accolades? Not in today\u2019s voting system . See: Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry taking votes from each other. Shaun Powell :  They wouldn\u2019t have gotten three. Maybe two. Maybe Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook get the MVPs, with James Harden collecting a few Kia Sixth Man awards. All three would\u2019ve been All-Stars virtually every season and my hunch says they\u2019d have at least one championship by now. Yes, it\u2019s hard to say for sure; so many unforeseen circumstances could\u2019ve thrown them and OKC for a loop. Still, my reasoning: They all got along and respected each other during their brief time together. And winning titles would\u2019ve kept them together. John Schuhmann :  Of course not. But it\u2019s more interesting to wonder if the Thunder would have won a championship and if Durant would have stayed in Oklahoma City had they not traded Harden when they did.  Sekou Smith :  No way. Absolutely not. Durant would have his trophy, but I don\u2019t believe Westbrook would have gotten his without KD\u2019s departure. I also don\u2019t think Harden would have gotten to this point, where he looks like the clear favorite to win it this year. What an unbelievable player haul by the Thunder. GM Sam Presti deserves credit for nailing those lottery picks in those drafts. And kudos to all three players for maximizing their talents. But I cannot imagine a scenario where these guys could have all claimed MVP hardware if they\u2019d never split up. The splintering of votes for three superstars would have squashed those dreams time and time again. As much as I\u2019d have loved to see how log they could have lasted as a Big 3, I truly believe the league is better with all three of them in their current situations. * * *"},{"id":47441,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-your-top-three-candidates-coach-year","date":"2018-03-07","title":"Blogtable: Who are your top three candidates for NBA Coach of the Year?","content":" * * * Your top three candidates for NBA Coach of the Year?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Toronto\u2019s Dwane Casey, Boston\u2019s Brad Stevens and Indiana\u2019s Nate McMillan , possibly in that order. Casey has helped to reinvent the Raptors after another disappointing playoff exit last spring and a summer in which his boss Masai Ujiri issued a somewhat ominous call for a \u201cchange in culture.\u201d Now Toronto has its best shot ever at The Finals. Stevens and his Celtics could have had their season yanked from under them in Game 1 when Gordon Hayward went down . Instead, Boston dominated early, turned massive personnel changes into all positives and still looms as a top East contender. And let\u2019s be honest, most folks expected the Pacers to whimper into lotteryland after the Paul George trade. Instead, this has been a bright, happy season in Indiana, with Victor Oladipo as a top Kia Most Improved Player candidate and a record better than George\u2019s OKC team. Tas Melas :  1. Dwane Casey. 2. Nate McMillan. 3. Brett Brown. Casey got multiple-time All-Stars to buy in to a new style of play. I thought it was unthinkable. That\u2019s real coaching right there, and the bench\u2019s success just puts it over the top. McMillan\u2019s team has surprised and he probably receives the least recognition of any playoff coach, so let\u2019s give him some here. Brown deserves a heck of a lot more than this acknowledgment for coming to work every day with a smile over the last few seasons. He has been a model of consistency in a consistently painful environment. Shaun Powell :  My choice by a large margin is Dwane Casey of the Toronto Raptors. I love how he has adapted and evolved his system to fit the needs of his players, and how the bench has developed. No. 2 is Nate McMillan of the Indiana Pacers \u2014 I\u2019m surprised his name hasn\u2019t come up much in this conversation. He\u2019s doing wonders for a team that lost Paul George and in preseason was targeted for last place in the East. No. 3 is Doc Rivers of the LA Clippers. He may not make the playoffs, but the Clippers lost Chris Paul, traded Blake Griffin, dealt with injuries all season \u2026 and they\u2019re still in postseason contention. John Schuhmann :  1. Dwane Casey. The Toronto Raptors are the only team that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They\u2019ve changed their offense, have actually been more improved on defense, and altered their rotation (no longer keeping either Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan on the floor at all times, even after losing their two most reliable reserves of the last couple of seasons), with terrific results. 2. Brad Stevens. The Boston Celtics have the league\u2019s No. 1 defense and its fourth best record , having lost an All-Star to injury in the first six minutes of the season and with four first or second-year players in the rotation. 3. Mike D\u2019Antoni. Daryl Morey obviously did a terrific job in the offseason, but D\u2019Antoni is the architect what\u2019s happening on the floor. He was the Coach of the Year last season and the Houston Rockets have been improved on both offense and defense.  Sekou Smith :  Dwane Casey is my frontrunner for Coach of the Year. It\u2019s not often you see a coach with his seasoning and stature scrap what\u2019s been working and completely revamp his offense. Casey has always been a defensive mastermind, but to do what he\u2019s done on the other side of the floor has been simply tremendous for a team that could very well end up as the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. And Masai Ujiri should be at the top of your Executive of the Year list, too. Brad Stevens has worked wonders in Boston for some time now. And he\u2019s the second name on my list. Alvin Gentry and Nate McMillan are tied for the third spot , and I\u2019d go with the guy whose team finishes with more wins this season. They\u2019re doing excellent work under trying circumstances (you see what you can put together when you lose talent like DeMarcus Cousins and Paul George, respectively)."},{"id":41461,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-markelle-fultz-no-cutoff-date-playing-season","date":"2018-03-07","title":"Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown: No cutoff date set for Markelle Fultz's return","content":" The Philadelphia 76ers got win No. 35 last night by beating the Charlotte Hornets, 128-114 .

He did not paint a particularly clear picture of when the guard may play again : Fultz has been traveling with the team and has gotten shots up \u2014 particularly from 3-point range \u2014 in pregame scenarios, adds Camerato. Fultz struggled to begin the season, averaging 6.0 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 18.9 minutes . He shot just 33 percent overall (9-for-27), 50 percent on free throws (6-for-12) and has not attempted a 3-pointer. * * *"},{"id":41465,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-owner-steve-ballmer-blake-griffin-trade-state-team","date":"2018-03-07","title":"Owner Steve Ballmer: LA Clippers 'playing more freely' since roster makeover","content":" When the LA Clippers pulled the trigger and traded All-Star Blake Griffin on Jan. 30, they were on the fringe of the playoff picture .

The Houston Rockets have risen to the top of the Western Conference basically since the calendar turned to 2018 this season. They entered last night with a 15-game win streak, which was tied for the second-longest run in team history. After topping the Oklahoma City Thunder on the road 122-112 , this season\u2019s squad took over sole possession of that No. 2 spot in Rockets annals. Behind Chris Paul (25 points) and Kia MVP favorite James Harden (23 points, 11 assists), the Rockets took down a Thunder squad that had logged wins this season against Golden State (twice), Toronto and Cleveland. Yet to Harden, per The Associated Press, he had a blunt answer when asked what Houston\u2019s win streak means to him. \u201c\u2018Nothing,\u201d he said. \u201dNothing at all. We just want to play well. We want to play well and have each other\u2019s back, no matter what, on both ends of the floor. It doesn\u2019t matter. Wins and losses will come.\u201d Yet the Rockets aren\u2019t the only team in the West getting attention of late. The New Orleans Pelicans are surging, having won nine straight games behind the play of All-Star big man Anthony Davis . In last night\u2019s showdown with the playoff-hopeful LA Clippers, Davis went off once again, logging 41 points, 13 rebounds, three steals and three blocks in a 121-116 New Orleans win . He scored 31 of those points in the second half, as he left the game in the second quarter with a rib contusion. \u201cDeMarcus [Cousins] told me at halftime, he said if you\u2019re not going back in, let me get your Achilles,\u201d Davis told the Players Only crew after Tuesday\u2019s game. Davis has been a one-man wrecking crew during this run, as he has scored no fewer than 23 points in a game during this win streak. He\u2019s averaging 37.7 points, 14.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals and three blocks per game while shooting 53.2 percent overall and 41.9 percent on 3-pointers during the nine-game win streak. He also has six games of 35-plus points during that span . Perhaps most key, though, is that the Pelicans are 8-0 this season when Davis logs 40 or more points in a game. \u201cHe is just playing on a really high level and nothing seems to affect him,\u201d New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said of Davis. \u201cThat is a really tough (rib) injury right there. It feels like somebody is sticking an icepick in your side when you are trying to breathe with those bruised ribs and stuff like that. But he played through it and did a great job.\u201d The win keeps New Orleans in the chase for the No. 3 seed, which is held by the Portland Trail Blazers. They\u2019ve been making noise as well, with an All-Star of their own leading the charge. Damian Lillard dropped 37 points on the visiting New York Knicks last night in a 111-87 Blazers romp . Much like Davis, Lillard has put his team on his back and done a yeoman\u2019s share of the work as the Blazers have won eight in a row. Portland\u2019s eight-game winning streak marks its longest since Nov. 9-26, 2014 as the Blazers grew their lead in the Northwest Division to 1 1\/2 games. During this streak \u2014 which began on Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 Lillard has given Portland fans reason after reason to love their go-to guy. He\u2019s averaging 33.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 5.8 apg and 1.3 spg while shooting 47.1 percent overall and 41.8 percent on 3-pointers during the win streak , which included victories against teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz and Golden State Warriors. Lillard made team history during the streak as well. He has now scored 354 points over the past 10 games, more than any Trail Blazer has scored in a 10-game span in team history. And for good measure, Lillard further etched his place in team history last night. First, he passed Cliff Robinson for No. 4 on the team\u2019s all-time scoring list and by game\u2019s end, had passed former teammate LaMarcus Aldridge for third on the team\u2019s all-time free throws made list . Per ESPN Stats & Information, Tuesday marked Lillard\u2019s 11th 35-point game of the season, which ties him for the most he had in any season of his career. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a good run, just playing good basketball on both ends of the floor,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cOur team has been on a string; we\u2019ve been really connected.\u201d \u201cDame was just in a great groove,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said last night. \u201cHe\u2019s been in a groove for awhile.

That's not the only question looming in Detroit","content":" If he weren\u2019t coaching the Pistons, Stan Van Gundy could run for office in Detroit and probably win. His personality, his nature, his political leanings and his connection with the everyday man and woman meshes with a no-nonsense city that deserves strong leadership but rarely gets it. Pull up a chair and Van Gundy, approachable and magnetic, will sermonize on the evils and hypocrisy of society as well as sports, delivering with a common-sense style that will make you wonder why all people in authority aren\u2019t this free of agendas and conflicts of interest. The problem is, Van Gundy does coach the plummeting Pistons, and as team president, he drives them as well. His approval rating therefore is slippery, along with his grip on both jobs based on the dire circumstances that he and the Pistons currently find themselves in. They\u2019re running out of time and excuses for not making the playoffs, a real possibility with 18 games left in the regular season. The man responsible for this is hearing the music in Detroit and it isn\u2019t Smokey Robinson. Of all the playoff contenders in the NBA, is anyone on skates quite like the Pistons? At one point they were 14-6, now they\u2019re nearly five games out of the eighth and final spot in the East. Also, they\u2019ve won just one road game since mid-December and, uh-oh, there\u2019s a six-game Western trip starting next week. They\u2019re backpedaling here in the stretch run and fumbling to stop the slide, losing to the likes of the Magic and Hornets and fresh from a 22-point lashing courtesy of the Cavaliers, who have their own issues. The Pistons\u2019 play has often looked lethargic and uninspiring and other than Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond, the performances are lacking. Speaking of Griffin, his arrival from last month\u2019s blockbuster trade was supposed to awaken the club and a skeptical fan base that\u2019s not exactly stampeding through the doors of the new Little Caesars Arena. Yet, after an initial splash, the opposite has happened; the Pistons have lost nine out of 11 games, and six of seven since the All-Star break. They\u2019re lost. \u201cI know we\u2019re better and have better players than what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Van Gundy said. Overall, this presents a murky picture for a team created and coached by Van Gundy, who\u2019s in the fourth of a five-year deal. It could also spell the end of coaches doubling as grand pooh-bahs, with Van Gundy dangerously on pace to copy the fate of Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who was stripped of his front office stripes last summer. Actually, if the Pistons keep this up, losing one job but not both would be a victory of sorts for Van Gundy. And so you\u2019re compelled to ask: What in the heck happened? What began as an uplifting and bold hire by new owner Tom Gores in 2014 is in jeopardy of collapsing. At the time, Van Gundy was out of the game, healing from an awkward and public fallout with Dwight Howard in Orlando, yet still held a degree of leverage. His coaching chops were very much intact and respected and the view around the league was Van Gundy received a raw deal from the Magic, who reached the NBA Finals on his Rolex. Therefore, he was in demand with each opening. But there was a catch. Van Gundy sought power, if only to avoid any repeat of the Howard fiasco. This was understandable from a guy who felt burned by the higher-ups at his old gig. He could build his team in his vision, without interference from above, without worrying about the resident star player pulling rank and going over his head in the event of a beef. Well, the Pistons were desperate when Gores bought the team and ousted Joe Dumars, who struggled to piece together a solid roster in his final few years. The Pistons had Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva and Josh Smith, all making big money, none making a big difference. Once the pride of the Eastern Conference, they hadn\u2019t won a playoff game in six years, hadn\u2019t made the playoffs in five. Gores dangled both jobs and Van Gundy jumped at the chance. He was hailed as a savior the moment the ink dried. Van Gundy inherited a wreck and needed time to open the windows and let the stink out. With the help of trusty GM Jeff Bower, he scrubbed the Pistons clean of Dumars\u2019 moves quickly, salvaging only Drummond. But the results and the decisions have since been a mixed bag, at best. He hasn\u2019t yet taken advantage of the surest way to find a franchise player, through the draft, and whiffed on two golden opportunities. Van Gundy took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. Those are lopsided decisions that haunt teams and set them back or stagnate them. Free agency hasn\u2019t been much better. Van Gundy gave $42 million to Jon Leuer, a role player when healthy. Another $21 million went to Boban Marjanovic; Van Gundy mostly kept him benched before tossing him into the Griffin deal. The trades are keeping the Pistons afloat, most notably getting Tobias Harris for virtually nothing, same for Reggie Jackson, and finally Griffin, a certified star and crowd pleaser who cost the Pistons a first-rounder, Harris and Avery Bradley. Collectively, Van Gundy received more than what he spent in those deals.  Jackson\u2019s time in Detroit is marked by solid play and plenty of pain. It\u2019s possible they wouldn\u2019t be in this bind if Jackson were healthy; he\u2019s working his way back from an ankle sprain that felled him during the holidays. Once he returns, and the timetable remains unclear, he\u2019ll give the Pistons a third wheel next to Drummond and Griffin. About Griffin: His efficiency is falling and feeding hints that he probably left his best years in Los Angeles. In his first five years with the Clippers, Griffin shot nearly 53 percent and was a fixture in the paint. Since then, he\u2019s had injuries and also stretched his shooting range, which certainly contributes to what we see now. Griffin\u2019s down to 42 percent this year, and while he\u2019s more confident from 18 feet and beyond, he needs more shots, too. He\u2019s only 28 and still someone who commands the respect of a double team. Also, he and Drummond are pairing up nicely so far and already developing on the same wavelength. The only potential worry lies more with his contract. His salaries the next four seasons, in millions: 31.8, 34, 36, 39. The Pistons are on the hook for that. For a player with a history of injuries (most were freakish in nature), that future money could be problematic. Also: Will Griffin fulfill another promise and help fill the empty seats in Detroit? That\u2019s partly why Van Gundy pulled off the deal, to give the Pistons someone worth the price of admission. Well: The Pistons are operating at 82 percent capacity, second-lowest to the Hawks. A team with the eighth-highest payroll is currently on the outside of the playoff bubble and struggles to sell tickets. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in Van Gundy\u2019s favor: He hasn\u2019t had a full season with Griffin and perhaps deserves one. Also, Gores likes him. Gores is a different kind of owner; he lives in Los Angeles and spends time with his private equity firm. He\u2019s mainly a ghost in Detroit and hands-off with the basketball operation. There is, however, Arn Tellem, the former ace agent who\u2019s now the Pistons\u2019 vice chairman. Surely, Gores will huddle up with Tellem this summer before weighing in on Van Gundy. It\u2019s possible Tellem could assume control of the basketball operation, much like other agents who\u2019ve made the jump to the other side with the Suns, Lakers and Warriors. Because Van Gundy has only one year left on the deal, and teams rarely allow coaches or executives to reach lame-duck status, something\u2019s bound to happen one way or another this offseason. There\u2019s still hope for the playoffs, however faint. Jackson will eventually return to form Lob (Motor) City, fortunes can change abruptly, and if they find themselves back in the mix, the Pistons close out with three of four games against lightweights. They need to make the playoffs to raise the possibility of zero happening to Van Gundy. Not surprisingly, Van Gundy isn\u2019t feeding speculation by even addressing the topic of his future. He\u2019s busy scratching his head and just trying to comprehend the present, much like everyone else. And like any responsible man in charge, he owns up. \u201cI\u2019ve got confidence in those guys and they should be able to play better than they are, and that\u2019s what gets you as a coach,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cI got to take the responsibility. I\u2019m obviously not getting us the right shots for the right people and I\u2019m not finding the answers. I\u2019m not leaving it on them.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

In a recent interview with TNT analyst David Aldridge, DeRozan explained how support from fans and others around the world have helped encourage him since disclosing his struggle. Today, in an essay on The Players\u2019 Tribune, Cleveland Cavaliers All-Star forward Kevin Love disclosed that he suffered a panic attack earlier this season during a game . In the piece, which is titled \u201cEveryone Is Going Through Something\u201d, Love explains that he suffered the panic attack on Nov. 5 during the Cavs\u2019 117-115 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks . According to The Associated Press recap of that game, Love left the game in third quarter \u201cwith an illness. The team announced that Love, who had four points and four rebounds in 19 minutes, was treated and released.\u201d In his Players Tribune essay, Love explains what happened to him during the game and says he felt strange from the opening tip: Love played in the Cavs\u2019 next game, a 132-116 road win against the Milwaukee Bucks . In that game, he scored 32 points and pulled down 16 rebounds. According to Cleveland.com\u2019s Joe Vardon, Love suffered another panic attack in the Cavs\u2019 Jan. 20 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Love left that game after playing just three minutes for what the team said were migraines. His absence from that game was called into question by teammates during a Jan. 22 meeting. Here\u2019s more from Vardon on Love\u2019s absence in January : He says in his Players\u2019 Tribune piece that getting back on the court after that first panic attack helped, but the after-effects of the panic attack still worried him. The Cavaliers, he says, helped him find a therapist and work through some issues he was dealing with, particularly regarding the death of his grandmother years ago: Lastly, Love credits DeRozan for starting the conversation about mental health and professional athletes. But more than how it affects his NBA colleagues, Love makes it clear in his piece he is concerned about mental health issues for everyone, regardless of their profession: Hours after Love\u2019s essay was posted to The Players\u2019 Tribune, teammate LeBron James praised Love on Twitter and called Love \u201cmore powerful than ever before\u201d.

Draymond Green chopped it up in the locker room with James Harden. Harden and Steph Curry playfully re-enacted some of their favorite killer crossover moves. Klay Thompson put an arm around Mike D\u2019Antoni and squeezed. Good vibes all around. But this was a few weeks ago at the NBA All-Star Game , where selected Warriors and Rockets were on the same bench and page if for only a day. And in those last friendly minutes together, D\u2019Antoni, who coached those four players, was playfully sent a message by Curry, Green and Thompson, who \u201ckept trying to take my clipboard, trying to draw plays up and I had to fight \u2018em,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said then. If the Rockets and Warriors meet again \u2014 and their paths in the Western Conference are indeed headed toward a postseason intersection \u2014 there will be a fight, in the basketball sense. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve distanced themselves from everyone else while enjoying each other\u2019s close company all season. Too close for comfort, perhaps? The intrigue in the West, if not the entire NBA, is dominated by two teams who can\u2019t shake one another and maybe never will until late May. There are roughly six weeks remaining in the regular season and this much is pretty clear: The Warriors are facing their biggest conference threat since creating this dynasty four years ago. The Rockets need to secure the best record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs more than Golden State. And if basketball was fair, these teams would meet in the NBA Finals instead of one being left out. The Rockets, with a pair of 14-game winning streaks, have created the perception of being good enough to beat the Warriors, and the Warriors have looked vulnerable enough to raise this previously-unthinkable possibility just the slightest. Their hand-holding sprint to the regular-season finish and pending collision course at the Western Conference finals is the best drama going in the NBA outside of the Cavaliers. It\u2019ll be curious to see how two teams thriving mainly on 3-point shooting and creating chaos and supported by Kia MVP candidates settle the issue once and for all. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play hard, play for each other and the results are going to show,\u201d Harden said. \u201cYou can see how each individual works at his craft, whatever his craft is. We\u2019re putting all those pieces together along with the coaching staff we have. \u201cWe can\u2019t be comfortable and say we have the best record in the league. We still have to prove ourselves. We\u2019re not at a time to relax at all. We know how important this opportunity is. It\u2019s up to us to take advantage of everything coming our way and make the most of it.\u201d Yes, all the mystery mainly lies with the Rockets and whether they\u2019re for real as a title contender. We know about the Warriors. We\u2019re just now warming up to the Rockets. They\u2019re not bringing the two championships in three years or the track record of performance under pressure as the Warriors. By comparison, the Rockets are untested, unproven, more wishful. Yet: \u201cI think we have a serious chance,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. The Rockets won two out of the three meetings with the Warriors this season; they\u2019re only the fourth team to beat the Warriors twice in a season since Steve Kerr became coach. They own the second-best offense, no surprise, and rated 10th defensively, a surprise. Of course, there\u2019s also Harden, who\u2019s pole-positioned to win the Kia MVP, arguably the best player in the NBA over the last three years after LeBron James. Harden has elevated himself as a must-see star who leads the NBA in scoring (31.2) and is third in assists (8.9) and has a 60-point triple double this season. Harden\u2019s impact in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system can\u2019t be stressed enough, because it doesn\u2019t work unless he works. The ripple effect is ridiculous. His command of the double team makes Houston\u2019s dependence on the 3-pointer understandable, considering Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson all get an enviable share of open looks. How effective would they be if they needed to create the majority of their shots? Perhaps not nearly as much. Their value is inflated by Harden, at least in this system. Harden\u2019s dribble game and ability to shake defenders and reach the paint also produces layups for him or dunks for Clint Capela (65.5 percent field goal percentage); the defense can pick its poison. Those are the high percentage shots that give Houston another dimension and offensive balance. In all, the Rockets have seven players in double figures scoring and it\u2019s mostly due to Harden and the attention he gets. It\u2019s the true definition of making teammates better. Does it need to be mentioned that Harden, often a punch line when it comes to defense, is eighth in the league in steals ? Perhaps a reputation is being chopped down, at last. His bond with newcomer Chris Paul has been quick and problem-free, which is refreshing for Houston because of the often-tricky chemistry between ball-dominant stars in the past. Both made sacrifices to make it work by playing off the ball and showing mutual respect. And no starting backcourt in the NBA delivers more assists (17 per game), evidence of their instincts and willingness to share. It\u2019s a collaborative machine that squeezes the specific talents of everyone who checks into the game. \u201cThings are obviously going pretty good,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt helps that we\u2019re in a race for the first seed. I think the guys enjoy coming into the locker room and playing. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a hurry for the season to get over with. It\u2019s been a great season so far and they\u2019ve enjoyed every day of it. I think the talk is, \u2018boy, this is going by really fast.\u2019 So if we can just make this last a little longer, it\u2019ll be great.\u201d  The Rockets are 32-1 with Paul, Harden and Capela on the floor together and overall have played only five games decided by three points or less. If you diminish the five-game losing streak during the holidays (Capela missed four of those games and Paul missed three), where would the Rockets be? Remember, they won 25 of their first 29. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about the Rockets and not anybody else,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. The current 15-game win streak , Harden\u2019s MVP candidacy, Paul\u2019s arrival, 18 games with at least 19 made threes and improved defensive play are making the Rockets feel frisky. Two recent comments bear this out: Capella saying \u201cnow we know that we can definitely beat them\u201d \u2014 meaning the Warriors \u2014 on Jan. 20 and Harden\u2019s \u201cthis is the year, for sure\u201d declaration a week ago. When\u2019s the last time a team in the West were led by their chin and chest and genuinely felt they stood on equal ground with the Warriors during Golden State\u2019s current dynasty? In 2014-15, the Rockets finished second in the West but in truth were mismatched against the Warriors ; the harmony was prickly between Harden and Dwight Howard. The next season, the Spurs had a franchise-record 67 wins and added LaMarcus Aldridge and saw Kawhi Leonard become a blowout star, but they lost to Oklahoma City in the second round. The Thunder that year were well-equipped to handle the Warriors, and they did through the first four games of the West finals before Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook blew a 3-1 lead . That series swung in Golden State\u2019s favor in a pair of ways; not only did the Warriors rally, but they also convinced Durant to sign up that summer. With Durant, the Warriors weren\u2019t threatened by anyone in the West last season, especially after the Spurs lost Leonard in the first game of their playoff series. But now the Rockets are not only back in the mix, they reloaded with Paul and an improved Capela and a better sense of the D\u2019Antoni system. Also, Gordon (18.7 points) is playing the best basketball of his life at age 29 and PJ Tucker was added last summer to bring a German Shepherd\u2019s attitude. Durant has noticed the difference, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re playing harder. And they\u2019re definitely playing defense harder than before.\u201d D\u2019Antoni knows the Rockets are at a disadvantage in terms of championship wisdom, something that\u2019s noticeably missing from Harden, who reached The Finals with OKC and played poorly in the series, and Paul, who hasn\u2019t advanced beyond the second round. He spoke lately about developing \u201cchampionship habits\u201d and believes winning will take care of that when and if the Rockets travel deep into the playoffs. He said: \u201cWe do have the talent and the ability to play and beat anybody at any time. We do have a goal in trying to win it. No shame in that. We also know Golden State\u2019s the best team. We still have some growing to do. They\u2019ve won the championship. We\u2019re confident, but at the same time, we know they\u2019ve done it.\u201d The Rockets are well on pace to post the best regular-season record in franchise history and yet that won\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll come with best overall record in the West. The Warriors are still running in-step at the moment. April will determine how important it is to the Warriors, who could rest their starters more often than D\u2019Antoni will sit Harden and Paul. Again: Houston seemingly wants home-court more, and maybe needs it more. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to take it one step at a time and be the best that we can be.\u201d And the Warriors? They\u2019ve adopted the \u201ccatch us if you can\u201d attitude and placing a premium on staying healthy, first and foremost. Perhaps fortified by two championships in three years and the knowledge that any warts at the moment can be erased once the postseason begins, they rightly see themselves as the hunted, rather than the hunter, in the West. Coach Steve Kerr has harped on the Warriors\u2019 occasional defensive lapses and more than a few times this season wondered if the team is still responding to him, which led him to famously hand over the clipboard a week ago to his players during timeouts. Still, few in the basketball world are buying the idea of the Warriors being unmotivated or diminished. And consider this: Despite all the Houston win streaks, the Warriors are also at the top in the West. How much of a psychological blow would it be to Houston if the Warriors clinch best record? Nothing\u2019s changed with the Warriors, who still have four All-Stars, a pair of MVP candidates in Curry and Durant, and noted playoff beast Andre Iguodala is slowly awakening from his regular season hibernation. Curry compared the current Rockets\u2019 confidence to Golden State\u2019s mentality before the titles began rolling in. That\u2019s why he chuckled at all the fuss made over the bravado comments from Capela and Harden and asked, \u201cwhat else are (they) supposed to say?\u201d The Warriors don\u2019t discuss the Rockets as much as the Rockets are willing to discuss them. That\u2019s understandable. Yet the time could be fast approaching when the Warriors must concede the obvious and there\u2019s nobody else except Houston standing between them and a fourth trip to The Finals.

He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life. I figured that if I said it enough, I would convince the world that I really was the greatest.\u201d \u2014 Muhammad Ali Ali defended his heavyweight championship 20 times, during two eras: when he was young and unstoppable, after beating Sonny Liston in Miami in 1964, and when he was old and vulnerable, after beating George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. He was the fastest heavyweight ever in the first era; he was smart and could take a punch in the second. A generation later, the Golden State Warriors are defending their NBA title for a second time, in three years. But they, too, are doing so in two eras. In 2014, no one had seen anything like what Golden State did on a basketball court, and how Stephen Curry\u2019s and Klay Thompson\u2019s shooting range changed the geometry of NBA defenses . They stretched to the breaking point trying to get out to Curry and Thompson. They couldn\u2019t figure out how to handle the Warriors\u2019 five-man switching defenses. They couldn\u2019t stand up under Golden State\u2019s withering pace . There is no need to hold a telethon yet for the Warriors, three years later. They are 49-14 today , with four All-Stars among their five starters, including Kia MVP candidate Kevin Durant, in the prime of his career, who wasn\u2019t there when the Warriors first beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals . They are still first in the league in Offensive Rating , first in True Shooting Percentage , first in Effective Field Goal Percentage . They still are unsolvable to most opponents. But maybe not all, not anymore. The margin of separation between Golden State and the rest of the league is still there, most of the time. But there are tiny signs of slippage. Tiny. You recall what Warriors assistant coach Bruce Frasier said in the preseason, when no one is injured and everyone thinks they\u2019re going 82-0. \u201cTeams are starting to figure us out a little bit,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe\u2019re talented, so that sometimes overrides strategy. But I feel like teams are figuring certain things out to do to counter what they\u2019ve seen. Year one, it was really hard, because it was all new. The pieces have changed a little bit, but I feel like our challenge will be to see if we can layer on some of the offense, our fluid movement, and counters, and change things up, and execute better. Defense is always big, too, so I wouldn\u2019t go into the complacent (problem). I think it\u2019s going to be more execution, and how smart can we really be, and can we keep that energy up through this year?\u201d In each of their previous three seasons, the Warriors led the league in margin of victory \u2014 10.1 points in 2014-15 , 10.8 points in 2015-16 and 11.6 points last season . This year, though, they\u2019ve fallen to third, behind the Houston Rockets and Toronto Raptors \u2014 and their win margin is down to 8.5 points per game . Two years ago, the Warriors were fourth in the league in Defensive Rating (100.9) . Last season, Golden State was second (101.1) . This season, the Warriors are fifth, at 103.4 . In 2014-15, they were 14th in the league in points allowed in the paint ; this year, they\u2019re 24th (to be fair, they were 23rd last year , when they won it all anyway). Are they bored? Tired? Aging? Is their bench inconsistency this year the result of vets saving themselves for the playoffs, or guys just getting old? And will it matter against anyone other than Houston? \u201cOnce you start getting a little older, it\u2019s harder and harder,\u201d guard Shaun Livingston said last week. \u201cWe definitely need the youth, we definitely need the health. We\u2019ve got to be healthy. We\u2019ve got to be healthy. Sometimes you see teams that maybe are over the hill \u2014 they have the experience, but maybe not (the ability). It\u2019s human nature. Obviously, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. We\u2019ve got guys that are still in their prime. It\u2019s mental now.\u201d In the Jean-Pierre Coopman phase of their latest title defense (oh, how one misses spectacles like Ali fighting Coopman, the \u201cLion of Flanders\u201d \u2014 with Pat Summerall and Tom Brookshier on the call!), the Warriors came to Washington last week. There was no White House visit on the docket, only time with D.C. area kids and a trip to the African-American History Museum , with owner Joe Lacob and GM Bob Myers on the trip as well. They have been in the public eye for five years now, back to Mark Jackson\u2019s last season as coach, when the Splash Brothers exploded into the national consciousness . That\u2019s a long time for one NBA team to have all that light and heat on it. For a minute, the Warriors tried to convince themselves that there was a backlash building against them nationally, that people had grown tired of their 3-pointers and video game point totals. It was, of course, a ridiculous posit \u2014 Golden State and its players are more popular than ever, the love for Curry such that he felt perfectly comfortable posting a photo of the glass table he accidentally smashed in his hotel room on Instagram , any criticism surely to be muted amid America\u2019s love for the two-time MVP. https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bfy7u2RgBlv\/?utm_source \u201cThere was a little guy who was probably eight years old, and he came up and introduced himself,\u201d Steve Kerr said. \u201cHis name was Ryan, and I\u2019m talking to him, and he goes \u2019oh, my God, there\u2019s Quinn Cook!\u2019 And he ran over to Quinn Cook. Not Steph, not me \u2014 he loved Quinn Cook. That was cool.\u201d Throughout the Warriors\u2019 run, they\u2019ve faced down different challengers in the Western Conference \u2014 the first iteration of the Rockets with Harden, a hybrid inside-out attack where Houston unhappily and unsuccesffully tried to meld Harden and Dwight Howard in the post . The Durant\/Russell Westbrook one-two combo in Oklahoma City. The Spurs, morphing from the Tim Duncan\/Tony Parker-led team to the Kawhi Leonard-dominant one. The \u201cLob City\u201d Clippers, followed by the Chris Paul\/Blake Griffin halfcourt version. But this season\u2019s Rockets, with Paul at the point, may be the most unique and dangerous threat to the Warriors. They are much more than a team that just rains 3-pointers on you \u2014 though they most certainly do that, and do it historically well. They\u2019re also an outstanding defensive team, with the additions of P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute giving them a grit they haven\u2019t had in past seasons to pair with the shot blocking and rim presence of Clint Capela. The numbers are stark: Houston is 32-1 this season when Paul, Harden and Capela all play , including two wins over the Warriors. The Rockets have no obvious weakness. They have no fear of Golden State, either, having won two of the three meetings with the Warriors this season. It\u2019s not just that they\u2019re good, it\u2019s how they\u2019re good that makes them look like the greatest challenge yet to Golden State\u2019s hegemony in the West. \u201cI mean, yes, because they do it a different way, I guess,\u201d Curry said last week. \u201cThey adopted the power of the three ball and try to use it as a main weapon, and obviously with James and CP together. Honestly, we know that they\u2019re playing well. We\u2019re chasing that number one seed and keeping tabs on how they\u2019re playing and whatnot. But at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a lot of time left before we have to face them again. We know they\u2019re serious. But so are we.\u201d The Warriors have had to deal with great adversity during their run, to be sure. The biggest challenge came about this time last year, when a collision between teammates \u2014 Zaza Pachulia and Durant, in D.C., ironically \u2014 culminated in a Grade 2 MCL sprain and bone bruise for Durant , taking him out of the lineup at the worst possible part of the season. Golden State had just ripped off wins in 23 of its previous 27 games since a lamentable Christmas Day loss to the Cavs . Curry had started to figure out how to play with KD, and vice versa. They were in the middle of a brutal stretch of seven road games in eight overall, with the one brief return home to play the Celtics. When Durant went down, the initial fear was that he\u2019d torn his ACL and would be out for the season. The Warriors\u2019 locker room was funeral after the Wizards game. \u201cObviously, we were trying to figure out if he was like \u2019done-done\u2019 for the year, or whether or not there was going to be a chance he\u2019d return,\u201d forward David West said. \u201cWe were, at the time he got hurt, we were just starting to figure out the sort of roles, everybody was getting comfortable with roles. We basically had to reset., change some of the functions we were doing. We lost a few games trying to literaly just figure out and recalibrate and re-balance. That was one of those periods where we were just looking at each other, trying to start this thing \u2014 we lost this huge, huge piece.\u201d Yet the Warriors figured it out on the fly. And how they responded then provides a big clue to how they might respond to the challenge the Rockets present to them now. \u201cIt took us, I think we needed to get home before we were able to stablize,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI want to say we lost three of the last four on the trip or something (they did lose three of four, but one of the three losses was at Oracle in that one home game with the Celtics). We got home and righted the ship and got going. But sometimes (an injury is) a galvanizing force when a guy gets hurt, and you have to do certain things. Like, for us, when Kevin got hurt, we talked about it and we said we have to be the best defensive team in the league. We don\u2019t have that luxury of throwing the ball to Kevin and saying \u2019get us 30 points tonight.\u2019\u201d During that stretch without Durant (March 2, 2017 to April 5, 2017), who returned just before the start of the playoffs, the Warriors led the league in the league in Defensive Rating (100.0, just head of San Antonio\u2019s 100.2), first in opponent field goal percentage (.429), tied for second in opponent 3-point percentage (.316) and fourth in opponent points allowed per game (100.9). And once Durant returned for good, the Warriors again flexed. They tore through the West, winning all but one game en route to a third straight NBA Finals. And they took the Cavaliers apart in five games for their second title in three years. \u201cYou could see Draymond, Klay, Andre, Shaun, those guys, even Loon (Kevin Looney), were like, \u2019we didn\u2019t have KD last year,\u2019 \u201d West said. \u201cFor someone like myself, I just followed their lead. Klay got a little more aggressive. Draymond sort of settled everybody defensively. And we started winning.\u201d That muscle memory will come in handy this year. Durant and Curry have missed time with injuries, and Golden State hasn\u2019t figured out things at center just yet. (Would it shock me if rookie Jordan Bell played a big role there down the stretch? No, it would not.) But the Warriors still are smoking people in the second halves of games; per teamrankings.com, the Warriors lead the lead in third-quarter scoring margin at 5.3 points per game, more than double the margin of the second-place Denver Nuggets. Whether it\u2019s adjustments or something else (\u201cmainly, fiery halftime speeches, Knute Rockne style,\u201d Kerr opines), they have again put a lot of opponents away with 12 minutes to spare. Since the All-Star break, they\u2019re fourth in the league in opponent field goal percentage (.433) and Defensive Rating (100.3). \u201cThis year, obviously, knock on wood, we want to stay healthy,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe want to continue to push in the right direction. Every year\u2019s different. That\u2019s the fun part about this league. No matter how much success you\u2019ve had and what your expectations are, it\u2019s a different journey every year. We\u2019re right in the middle of that right now. We have an amazing record, considering how we\u2019ve played. I think we\u2019d all say we haven\u2019t lived up to our own expectations. That\u2019s okay. We have an opportunity to build the right habits and the right momentum going into the playoffs this year and do it, all 15 guys.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

That it came from the Twitter account of a four-time NBA All-Star, whose team was en route to the best season in franchise history, only added to the confusion. But there it was. \u201c This depression get the best of me\u2026\u201d DeMar DeRozan tweeted, and it surprised just about everyone, because the 28-year-old is pretty quiet most of the time. But DeRozan has been carrying a lot on his plate. Not only is trying to lead Toronto somewhere it\u2019s never been before, but has never has as a good a chance before, either \u2014 The Finals \u2014 but he\u2019s been doing it while going back and forth between Toronto and Los Angeles, where his father, Frank DeRozan, has been hospitalized for weeks. Frank DeRozan has been DeMar\u2019s biggest coach, biggest critic and biggest champion his whole life, never being satisfied as his son rose through the ranks of basketball, from Compton High to USC to the NBA. But Frank DeRozan has suffered health setbacks in recent years \u2014 a stroke and significant kidney problems, per the Toronto Sun \u2014 and DeMar has gone bicoastal multiple times to be with his dad, never missing a game in the process . (Frank DeRozan was able, though, to temporarily leave the hospital last month in L.A. to go to Staples Center to see DeMar play for Team Stephen in the All-Star Game.) In his ninth season in Toronto \u2014 he\u2019s never asked for a trade and agreed almost immediately to a $139 million extension with the Raptors in 2016, never even looking at free agency \u2014 DeRozan has scored less than he did last season, but is averaging a career-high 5.2 assists and gone all in on Toronto\u2019s \u201cculture reset,\u201d as GM Masai Ujiri put it after the Raptors went out again in the playoffs last year. After years of resisting, arguing not without merit that he was a master of the mid-range game, DeRozan has embraced the 3-pointer this season, obliterating his previous highs for attempts and makes behind the arc, and keeping the ball moving both to fellow All-Star Kyle Lowry and to the team\u2019s emerging cast of young, talented players, who\u2019ve helped carry the load all season. After winning Sunday, the Raptors are an Eastern Conference best 45-17, and are closing in on home court throughout the playoffs in the East. All would seem to be great. But, as DeRozan\u2019s social media statement made clear (and, to his credit, he acknowledged it was him and that he wasn\u2019t hacked, and he hasn\u2019t taken the Tweet down), life sometimes gets in the way of all our dreams. Me: So, your dad was able to come to Staples Center to see you at the All-Star Game. How was that for him? DeMar DeRozan: It was good. It was real good. He had a good time. It was cool for him to be able to come out and experience it and enjoy it. It made me feel good. He was happy about it. Me: And how is he doing? DD: Every day is one of them things where you just don\u2019t know until he\u2019s home. Until he gets home, that\u2019s when I think I\u2019ll be more comfortable, knowing, cool, you\u2019re out of there. He\u2019s been in there since Dec. 23. It\u2019s March 2nd. I know just that is bothering him, being in there and wanting to get out. Just on top of that, my mom, when I was home the other day, my mom was telling me \u2018this is the longest I\u2019ve been without my husband in 30-plus years.\u2019 Stuff like that, that\u2019s the rough part of it. Me: So is that where your head\u2019s at right now? DD: Without a doubt. For sure. One thing I always try to do whenever I go out there and play is try to do whatever I can, knowing I\u2019m so far, doing something I know will make them proud, make them feel good, give them a kind of energy. That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019ll be with it. Me: Is it hard to compartmentalize? So many people say the court is their refuge? DD: For me, it\u2019s easy to do, from the moment of playing to kind of lock in and focus and kind of indulge in that moment. It\u2019s crazy you say that, because Kyle, he\u2019s one of my closest friends, he knows me so well. A lot of times after the game, the first thing he\u2019ll say to me is \u2018back to reality.\u2019 He knows now our night is over. Now I have to go back and get into the reality of DeMar. It\u2019s crazy. Me: What have you heard from folks since you sent that tweet out? DD: Man, where haven\u2019t I heard from? Honestly, the response, I can honestly say that I wouldn\u2019t have even thought how the response, how it came out, I wouldn\u2019t have thought I\u2019d ever gotten anything like that. Especially me. I\u2019ve never been one who wanted any type of attention, good nor bad. The response I got from people was so uplifting, positive, refreshing. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. But it made me feel good. You just look at certain things. People say \u2018you helped me. Because if you\u2019re going through something like this, I can get through it.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible. By far one of the most incredible things in my career that I\u2019ve witnessed outside of basketball. Me: So you could be a role model in a whole different way. DD: For sure. I never looked at myself and said \u2018man, I want to be a role model.\u2019 But something like that is extremely important. It\u2019s all walks of life. I done had high school players, college players, older people. I had one older coach that I\u2019ve known text me and tell me, \u2018if there was a player when I was young that I\u2019d seen or witnessed who was going through something (like this), it would have helped me \u2014 then \u2014 not be an alcoholic.\u2019 It was incredible to hear words like that. It\u2019s been one of them things where I\u2019m like, \u2018damn, I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u2019 It\u2019s crazy. Me: Is there anything you\u2019re doing formally or officially now to deal with it? DD: Nah. I think I\u2019m going to definitely, once we\u2019re all said and done, probably the summertime for sure, I\u2019ll be open arms about it without a doubt. At the end of the day, it\u2019s like it\u2019s one of them things where you can\u2019t play basketball forever, but if there\u2019s something I can do that will outlast it and be helpful, be bigger than basketball, I\u2019m all for it. It\u2019s life. Me: So y\u2019all are in this new position on top of the East. You\u2019ve been good for a minute over the years, but this is the top of the top. Is the vibe different in the locker room? DD: Definitely. It\u2019s more, we have fun with one another, but we understand it\u2019s bigger than us all. We, all of us \u2014 young guys, all of me. Me and Kyle always tell the young guys, \u2018this opportunity doesn\u2019t always come around that often. Take advantage of this and be all for it. Before you know it, you\u2019re going to be 10 years in, and the opportunity may not come again. Take full advantage of it.\u2019 And everybody understands that. We see it now, especially when we have games where we lose a game. We think we\u2019re on a 10-game losing streak. That\u2019s how we approach coming in the next day at practice, or the next game. It\u2019s great to have that kind of feeling and vibe. Me: How do you know when you\u2019re all locked in? DD: You just know. I always look at my guy Kyle, and you know he\u2019s gonna ride or die with you. But it\u2019s crazy when you\u2019re able to look over at a guy like Pascal (Siakam), or Freddie (Van Vleet), or Delon (Wright), these young guys who only have a couple of years in the league, they\u2019ve got the same look that Kyle\u2019s got. That says a lot about the team. Because you know when those young guys go in, they\u2019re some dogs, too. That\u2019s the beauty of it, and it shows. Me: So, about those young guys. You know what you\u2019re gonna do in the playoffs, and you know what Kyle\u2019s gonna do, and Jo. But if you\u2019re going to beat an elite team in the playoffs, the young guys are gonna have to perform. DD: Yeah. And they have. I lost count of how many games our starters haven\u2019t even played in the fourth quarter. Against good teams, not just lower teams. There have been times where we\u2019re playing some great teams, and the coaches come in and look at us, and we\u2019re like, \u2018nah, let them finish out the game. They\u2019ve got this.\u2019 It\u2019s great to have that type of confidence in the young guys. It\u2019s amazing. I know we get a lot of credit, but they deserve just as much credit. Me: So is this the most optimistic you\u2019ve been going into the postseason? DD: Yeah. Because we\u2019ve done felt the fails. We\u2019ve been at the top, and we fell all the way to the bottom. We know what that feels like. We know what it feels like getting closer and closer. We understand the moments. That\u2019s the beauty of failing sometimes. Nobody wants to fail, but you have to to understand what it takes to succeed. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at mentally, and we understand what we have to do. \u2014 Utah Jazz forward Jae Crowder ( @CJC9BOSS ), Saturday, 1:34 a.m., issuing the Temecula-ish challenge to the Wolves\u2019 Jimmy Butler following a chippy Utah-Minnesota game Friday night in Salt Lake City. During the game, Karl-Anthony Towns was ejected after picking up two technical in the first half, and Crowder was kicked out in the fourth quarter after coming to the defense of teammate Ricky Rubio, who\u2019d been shoulder-checked to the ground by Jeff Teague . Teague got a Flagrant 2 and was ejected; Crowder was kicked out after picking up his second T of the game for jawing at Wolves\u2019 coach Tom Thibodeau . Then , Crowder jumped at Butler, who\u2019s still recovering from knee surgery and wasn\u2019t even at the game. Butler, though, had taken to Twitter and seemed to praise Teague for the hard hit on Rubio . Then , Butler clapped at Crowder, his former college teammate at Marquette, for jumping at Thibs , prompting Crowder\u2019s response; I\u2019m sure they were joking with one another, but Friday night was awesome nonetheless. \u201cI think he forgot which side he was on. It reminded me of Anchorman, when Brick winds up on the wrong side of the fight, and he\u2019s like, \u2018yeah!,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018no, no Brick, you\u2019re on this side.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Steve Kerr, to reporters, when asked if he was surprised that President Trump indicated he would be willing to buck the National Rifle Association and support more stringent gun control legislation.

If we had better players, I would have had it in January.\u201d \u2014 Wizards Coach Scott Brooks , tongue so far in cheek that it needed a visa to return to its normal position afterward, after being named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month last week and being asked by a reporter if he\u2019d deflect praise for the award to the team rather than himself. \u201cJohn Stockton was all about the assist and one time, I missed two layups in a row and he pulled me aside and said if I missed one more layup, he would never pass to me again.\u201d \u2014 Former Utah Jazz player Corey Crowder , the father of newly acquired Utah forward Jae Crowder, during an online Q&A with Jazz fans last Friday. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Dwayne Ballard: You\u2019re not going to start gunsplaining today, are you, Dwyane? If it will make the discussion go easier, why don\u2019t we just stick with the AR-15? Can we agree that such a weapon serves no legitimate \u201chome defense\u201d purpose? Do the opinions of the family of Eugene Stoner, who invented the weapon , mean anything to you? They\u2019re rather clear that they believe the AR-15 was never designed for civilian use. I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019ve never advocated law enforcement coming to your home and taking your Ruger or any other gun that you legally own. I would like to at least get AR-15s off the streets, out of gun shops and not available to the mentally ill or anyone who wants to use them to kill dozens of people at one time, as they have done time after time after time in the last five years. Can we at least agree on that? Or is the restriction on the sale of any weapon the problem for you? They are only salty when the Chuckster\u2019s name comes up, from my dealings. From John Hunter: I don\u2019t think that represents anything close to the majority of Spurs\u2019 fans, John. Most of them are well aware of their franchise\u2019s good fortune in going rather seamlessly from David Robinson to Tim Duncan to Tony Parker to Kawhi Leonard, and having a coach\/GM combo of the quality and durability of Gregg Popovich and R.C.

Cuban told Naismith Memorial Hall of Famer Julius Erving on Erving\u2019s podcast a couple of weeks ago that he told his players during a recent dinner that \u201closing is our best option. Adam (Silver) would hate hearing that\u2026(but) we want the players to understand. As a player, you know that even though you may not agree, but at least if you respect the fact that someone took the time to talk to you, and you understood their perspective, you\u2019re going to give me your feedback, but you\u2019re part of the process.\u201d But the league fined Cuban for what it called \u201cpublic statements detrimental to the NBA\u201d three days later. And Silver sent a memo to all 30 teams last week detailing the league\u2019s position. *  Official release on Cuban\u2019s fine \u201cThroughout this period,\u201d Silver wrote, \u201cwe have been careful to distinguish between efforts teams may make to rebuild their rosters, including through personnel changes over the course of several seasons, and circumstances in which players or coaches on the floor take steps to lose games. \u201cThe former can be a legitimate strategy to construct a successful team within the confines of league rules; the latter \u2014 which we have not found and hope never to see in the NBA \u2014 has no place in our game.\u201d https:\/\/art19.com\/shows\/house-call-with-dr-j\/episodes\/069d0067-5793-4bf2-8461-3f92c4c307f9%20 Yet Cuban did not in any way, nor has any evidence to the contrary emerged, state the Mavericks were losing games on purpose; that is, players were intentionally missing shots, or not putting forth effort on defense to let the other team score, or anything like that. (Even Silver acknowledged in the memo that the league has \u201cno basis at this time to conclude that the Mavericks team is giving anything less than its best effort on the court, and Mark has assured us that this is not the case.\u201d) So, why the fine? Was what Cuban said so incendiary? \u2018\u2019Mark knew his comments were public, so it surprised me that he was so candid, but that\u2019s who Mark is,\u201d said one very high-ranking official from another team over the weekend. \u201cTo me his comment wasn\u2019t indicating tanking as their strategy but more about setting the expectation that playoffs were not a possibility. The only consolation of not making the playoffs is being in the lottery. You can\u2019t blame a team from trying to turn the lemon (losing) into lemonade (top 4 pick). The league needs to find a way not to reward losing.\u201d Exactly. What Cuban said was spot on \u2014 losing to improve the Mavericks\u2019 Draft position was, and is, the best and quickest way for Dallas to get better and start winning games again. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone agreed with Cuban being so blunt. \u201cI think it was a totally inappropriate to say that to players,\u201d said another extremely high-ranking team official for another team. \u201cWhatever the team\u2019s strategy may be, I firmly believe that the players should always play to win. The fine is meaningless to Mark; in fact, sometimes I think he enjoys the publicity he gets from the fines.\u201d But. We ask people to be truthful and not lie about their intentions. We tell our kids that no lie is worth telling, and that telling the truth, no matter how painful, is always the best choice. So Cuban is honest and tells the truth, that short-term losing makes more sense for his franchise\u2019s long-term interests, and he\u2019s relieved of 600 large by the league. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia 76ers are lauded \u2014 and revel in their slogan, \u201cTrust the Process,\u201d celebrated by the team\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2014 whose central tenet was to lose , and keep losing , until you could draft a player good enough to build around and win down the road . Which is, exactly, what Dallas is doing now. Indeed, increased tanking is the logical extension of an analytics-dominant league. If three is greater than two \u2014 the reasoning behind the primacy of the 3-pointer in today\u2019s NBA \u2014 then doing anything you can to get more ping-pong balls in the hopper is the correct thing to do. You can\u2019t just embrace the parts of doing it by the numbers that are pleasant. This is the flip side. Burying one\u2019s head in the sand and pretending teams don\u2019t do this doesn\u2019t make sense. Everyone does it in every sport, or don\u2019t you recall \u201cSuck for Luck,\u201d the chant of Indianapolis Colts\u2019 fans before the 2012 NFL Draft? What of Major League Baseball\u2019s Houston Astros losing 324 games from 2011-13? Were they trying to win games, or did we all imagine them going from $102 million in payroll in 2009 to $26 million by 2013? \u201cI resist the word \u2018tanking,\u2019 but I\u2019m very pro \u2018rebuilding,\u2019 when it\u2019s necessary,\u201d said Los Angeles Dodgers President Stan Kasten, who in a former life ran the Hawks as general manager in the \u201880s and \u201890s, by telephone Sunday. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s painful,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to explain it to your team, your fans, to your front office, to your coaches, to your wife, to your kids, to the country club. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s painful. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s first choice. But if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s often the quickest way to get the team back to winning. And don\u2019t lose sight of that.\u201d Kasten\u2019s Dodgers lost the World Series to the Astros , who methodically built their team the last four years around young drafted players like Series MVP George Springer , last fall in seven games. But not only is he not angry with Houston for the way management took the franchise\u2019s foundation to the studs \u2014 compared with his high-spending Dodgers \u2014 he admires the speed with which they went from worst to first. \u201cI have real feelings about what they did,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cBecause Mark Walter (the CEO of Guggenheim Partners, the global firm that bought the Dodgers in 2012 ) and I, before we bought the Dodgers, we were looking at Houston. Because they were available. And truthfully, when we looked at where they were, we were going to do the same thing. It had to be done. Because they were not on a track to win. And frankly, I don\u2019t think I could have done it as fast, or as well, as (Astros owner) Jim Crane, or (GM) Jeff Luhnow. Because doing that, to the extreme, takes real intestinal fortitude.\u201d  Kasten makes a strong distinction between a team cutting payroll and going young and that winds up losing, and one that\u2019s actively seeking ways to lose more games. \u201cAll of these owners are hyper-competitive, and they want to win,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cAnd truthfully, the quickest way to win, at least if you look at the last three world champions, is to rebuild and get young and get prospects and do it that way. And if you don\u2019t think that\u2019s the better way to go, ask the fans in Houston and Chicago and Kansas City how they feel. You won\u2019t get one fan who disagrees with what is done. It is the quickest way to win.\u201d Please do not misunderstand. I hate tanking. I hate the idea of introducing losing into your shop, even indirectly. It\u2019s like a virus, extremely difficult to get rid of once it gets in a franchise\u2019s bloodstream. A ticket is, in essence, a contract between parties: I pay top dollar, you give me top-dollar product in exchange. When a team tanks, it violates that compact; I don\u2019t recall any team that\u2019s given fans a tanking discount. It is also very difficult to tank effectively in the NBA. The last three teams with the best odds of getting the No. 1 in the Draft going into the Lottery \u2014 Boston (2017), Philadelphia (2016) and Minnesota (2015) \u2014 have indeed won. But prior to that, the team with the best odds didn\u2019t get the first pick for 10 consecutive years, and 22 times out of the last 25 years. And even the teams that did buck the odds and get the first pick often picked wrong, or did I miss Anthony Bennett Night in Cleveland, or the Andrea Bargnani statue outside of Air Canada Centre? \u201cThe Draft is often a crap shoot anyway,\u201d the official from the second team said. \u201cSo why not give your fans the best product that you can and then draft Donovan Mitchell,\u201d as Utah did this season. The Jazz traded for the rights to the Kia Rookie of the Year candidate , who was taken near the bottom of the Lottery (13th overall by the Denver Nuggets). This came a season after the Jazz went 51-31 and won its first-round playoff series . I agree. Tanking does not reward excellence in team building \u2014 good drafting, good free-agent signings, good player development \u2014 it rewards the exact opposite of that. It\u2019s a Golden Ticket that doesn\u2019t even require you to buy an Everlasting Gobstopper. But, tanking is reality. You can\u2019t pretend it isn\u2019t. And the only way to completely get tanking out of pro sports is to eliminate the Draft in all sports, including the NBA. We don\u2019t want to have that conversation, do we? Personally, I\u2019d love it. Can you imagine the fight that would set up between interested teams \u2014 and who wouldn\u2019t be interested? \u2014 in a certain 7-foot-1 freshman center almost certain to leave school early who currently plays for a school that\u2019s been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately? Would he help the Lakers? The Knicks? The Bulls? The NBA team in the state in which the college player currently plays, which rather desperately needs another star to pair with its one really great player (whose name, if you must know, rhymes with \u201cNevin Cooker\u201d)? Would he help any team in the league that doesn\u2019t currently employ Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns in the middle? Most assuredly. And if he could control where he wanted to go, and for how much, the process would be must-see TV. Yet, while the real-world implications would be fascinating, I\u2019m not sure how you could eliminate the Draft without loosening the underpinnings of the entire pro basketball enterprise (and, yes, one could make a moral case for doing just that, as it does go against the whole Manifest Destiny thing to artificially bind someone to a company rather than letting them market their services to the highest bidder). If there was no Draft, why would any player with Lottery-level talent go to college? Yes, there would be the occasional Grant Hill\/unicorn who wants to go to college to better themselves intellectually and\/or embrace the person growth that often comes from being on your own for four years. But, while sad to say, most kids with NBA dreams go to college because that\u2019s the path through which they can ultimately get to the pros the fastest. With no Draft, and few of the top college-age players thus needing\/wanting to go to college, you\u2019d have a very different March Madness than you have now. And as that is a multi-billion enterprise, both for the broadcast networks that air it (including Turner Sports, which runs NBA.com) and the colleges that reap the financial deluge it produces, the likelihood of across the board support for a new player acquisition model is slight. Not to mention, you\u2019d have a much different salary structure in the NBA, as there would be no rookie slotting for drafted players. And if you think the game\u2019s superstars would stand idly by and watch more of that cheddar that they helped produce go out the door to guys who haven\u2019t yet done anything \u2026 you\u2019d be wrong. So, the Draft isn\u2019t going anywhere. Which means the NBA must decide whether it wants to continue to be shocked, shocked that tanking is going on in its league, or accept the reality that there is not much patience for being in the middle ground in a league where every team is now worth more than $1 billion. There is only, as Pat Riley said a long time ago, winning and misery. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Portends well for the stretch drive. 15) Minnesota Timberwolves (1-2) [12]: Wolves, having played the most games in the league this season, finally get a break in March: six days off (!) before playing the Celtics Thursday, and just two back to backs all month. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Smith mum on kind of soup thrown at coach","content":" INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) \u2014 J.R. Smith\u2019s return from suspension was, ahem, soup-er. For one half. Smith scored all 19 of his points in the second half Saturday, but the struggling Cavaliers couldn\u2019t stop Denver\u2019s long-range shooting attack in a 126-117 loss to the Nuggets. Much like his season, Smith\u2019s comeback after he was benched by Cleveland for throwing a bowl of soup at Cavs assistant coach Damon Jones was strange. One of the NBA\u2019s least bashful shooters, Smith did not attempt a shot in the first half. But he let loose after halftime, making 7 of 8 shots before missing his last four. \u201cIn the second half I just figured to hell with it, just be more aggressive,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf they double me, try to get around them and then make a play. Just a different mindset, I guess.\u201d It\u2019s been an interesting 72 hours for Smith, who did not reveal his soup choice or the ingredients that steamed him so much he threw his soup at Jones following Thursday\u2019s shootaround. He sat out that night\u2019s game against the 76ers, adding another dramatic twist to what has been a tumultuous season for the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions. Asked before the Cavs fell to the Nuggets what he could share about the soup spat, Smith was as cold as gazpacho. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. And as for the kind of soup he flung? \u201cHonestly,\u201d he said Saturday following the team\u2019s shootaround. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember.\u201d Smith refused to say if he agreed with the discipline. He said he spoke with his teammates about what happened but not with Jones, a former NBA player who has been on Tyronn Lue\u2019s staff for two seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my call,\u201d the 31-year-old said on the merits of his punishment. \u201cMore than anything, I talked to my teammates about it, everybody seemed cool. We moved on from it as a team, so whether it warranted a suspension or not, that\u2019s not my job. I\u2019m just here to play basketball.\u201d Because of Smith\u2019s volatile reputation and shoot-first-ask-questions later playing style, his soup-throwing tantrum led to a social-media storm Friday as Twitter filled with posts about him and his possible soup choice. Smith was amused \u2013 to a point. \u201cSome of them were actually pretty funny,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that everything I do is going to have a meme or whatever behind it. That\u2019s just part of the day and age we live in. If this was 15 years ago, nobody would have even knew. It\u2019s just part of the game.\u201d Smith\u2019s had a challenging season on the floor \u2013 his 8.3 point average is his lowest since 2005 and he\u2019s making only 39 percent his shots \u2013 and his blowup at Jones could be the result of pent-up frustration. Smith, though, dodged a question about whether it was spur of the moment or something that had been building. \u201cI have an idea of what I want to say, but I\u2019m not going to say it,\u201d he said.\u201d So I\u2019m going to leave that as it is.\u201d Smith has been a key contributor to Cleveland reaching the NBA Finals the past three seasons. With All-Star Kevin Love sidelined with a broken hand, the Cavs need a dependable second scoring option behind LeBron James. Smith can fill that role \u2013 when his shot is falling and when he\u2019s behaving. James believes Smith will come around. \u201cHe knows how important he is to our ball club, both offensively and defensively since he got here,\u201d James said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s been a challenging year for him, but we expect for him to be there when we need him.\u201d James is close with both Smith and Jones, but he refused to get dragged into their food feud. \u201cAin\u2019t got nothing to do with me,\u201d he said. \u201cMomma told me a long time ago to mind your business.
