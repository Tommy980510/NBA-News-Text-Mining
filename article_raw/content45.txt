Curry will return to a Warriors team that\u2019s not quite the same as the one he left when he sprained his right ankle in New Orleans on Dec. 4. In his absence, the champs have improved defensively, ranking first on that end of the floor over the 11 games (despite Friday\u2019s loss to Charlotte) after ranking seventh through Dec. 5 . The biggest difference has been in the paint, where the Warriors have allowed their opponents to shoot just 46 percent over the last 11 games . The Cleveland Cavaliers shot 10-for-38 (26 percent) in the paint on Christmas, one of four games since Dec. 6 in which the champs have held their opponents under 40 percent in the paint. They\u2019ve also reduced the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from 3-point range, forcing more mid-range jumpers. Of course, without Curry, the offense has suffered. Before he was injured, the Warriors were on pace to break their own records for offensive efficiency and effective field goal percentage. They\u2019re still on track to set the effective field goal percentage mark, but they\u2019ve ranked 17th offensively over the last 11 games , falling to second overall . For the season, the Warriors have been 12.6 points per 100 possessions better offensively with Curry on the floor (having scored 118.9) than they\u2019ve been with him on the floor (106.3) . Without him, they still have two of the best shooters in NBA history and some brilliant passers, but the threat of Curry shooting off the dribble remains the biggest key to the Golden State offense. ESPN \u2018s Chris Haynes talked to Kevin Durant about the improved defense and the transition back to playing with the two-time MVP :"},{"id":42542,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-austin-rivers-exits-game-strained-achilles","date":"2017-12-30","title":"LA Clippers guard Austin Rivers exits game with strained Achilles","content":"LA Clippers guard Austin Rivers exited Friday night\u2019s game against the Lakers with a strained right Achilles, according to the team. The veteran combo guard appeared to suffer the injury late in the third quarter, when he fell awkwardly after accidentally planting his right foot toe-first into the hardwood. Rivers exited the game with 13 points, three assists and two rebounds.

It did just that through the first two months of the season, racking up an impressive 25-4 record highlighted by a 14-game winning streak of shooting destruction. Then the holidays arrived and the Rockets received two big lumps of coal in their stocking: injuries to All-NBA point guard Chris Paul (adductor strain) and blooming big man Clint Capela (calf, orbital fracture). The result: a five-game losing streak punctuated by a defeat to the inconsistent Wizards on Friday night . Houston already proved earlier this season it can do much more than tread water without Paul, who missed a month of the season after opening night. The team went 11-4 in that time because it happened to have another all-world playmaker who could shoulder heavy minutes in the meantime (James Harden). The same cannot be said concerning the Rockets\u2019 performance without Capela, whose absence looms much larger than the 25.6 minutes per game he plays. His role is as vital in its own way as that of the point guard(s). For D\u2019Antoni, he is a poor man\u2019s Amar\u2019e Stoudemire on offense and a zillionaire\u2019s Stoudemire on defense, the combination of which allows all those whirling perimeter wheels to leave tread marks on the hardwood. Capela is averaging career-highs in nearly every statistical category. He will get serious All-Star consideration, especially if Paul\u2019s own injury woes disqualify him in voters\u2019 eyes. During Houston\u2019s big winning streak, 10 of the Rockets\u2019 11 best five-man lineups in terms of plus-minus featured Capela or Paul. Five of the top eight included Capela. The other three relied on his backup, Nene, to fill the role of screen-and-roller and paint protector. The Brazilian big man still performs that role effectively, but \u2014 at age 35 and in year 16 of his career \u2014 is unable to do so for more than 15-to-20 minutes per game. That has left D\u2019Antoni resorting to small ball lineups featuring either shooting forward Ryan Anderson or limited big man Tarik Black in the middle. The former juices up the offense but submarines the defense. The latter does the inverse. Whether either of them are on or off the court, Houston has consistently sported a minus-10 net rating during the losing streak. Nene is the happy medium. He can plug both needs adequately enough to make a difference. During their current skid, the Rockets have played the competition nearly even with him on the floor. With their only competent big on the bench, they are a minus-10.4 per 100 possessions. Plug Capela back into the at least 100 of the last 162 minutes he has missed, and the Rockets are in a much better place. Injuries (ideally) get better. So do shooting slumps. During the losing streak, the Rockets have uncharactistically shot just 36.1 percent on wide open 3-pointers, per NBA.com. During their 14-game tear, Houston was hitting 43-percent of those same attempts. Given their league-leading shooting rate from beyond the arc, that\u2019s enough to tilt four single-digit outcomes out of their favor. Capela\u2019s return (which will reportedly take place on Sunday) will make it easier to absorb the occasional cold spell. He is the inside yin to all the outside-shooting yang spread around him. Until his absence, the Rockets boasted a top-10 defense to go along with its league-leading offense. During their losing streak (and most of Capela\u2019s absence), that defense has ranked dead-last in the league. His absence is another reminder of the delicate balance teams not named the Warriors pray holds up. For the Rockets, when all the parts are present and working, the machine as a whole is a vehicle of breathtaking precision. Remove one or two of those parts, and a minor fender-bender throws the entire operation out of whack."},{"id":42575,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/old-school-power-rankings-2017-18-weeks-9-10","date":"2017-12-30","title":"Old School Power Rankings 2017-18: Weeks 9-10","content":"We\u2019re starting to see a separation of powers with three distinct branches: The King, the fearsome foursome just behind him and the rest of the field. As for the past two-week period, there weren\u2019t many performances that stood out, hence little movement. For the new year, we\u2019re predicting one from the fearsome foursome makes a substantial leap toward the summit, one from the \u2018Just missed\u2019 category ascends into the top half of the list and one from the bottom three slips out of the race and never returns. Notes: Season statistics are through games of Dec. 28 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (33), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 26.3 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 10.2 apg Season stats: 27.8 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 9.3 apg Stop the presses! Wait, that doesn\u2019t really apply these days, so stop publishing that article to the internet! For the first time in 19 games (Nov. 20), James scored less than 20 points, going for 16 on 6-for-17 shooting in 38 minutes. Of course he still managed a triple-double (also adding five steals) in an ugly loss to the Kings. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 20.5 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 22.2 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 2.0 apg For the fifth time this season, Aldridge has strung together three straight games with 20 or more points. The secret seems to be the amount of rest. In two games with no rest, Aldridge went for 16.5 points, 10 rebounds and 44.8 FG%. In four games with one day of rest, he averaged 23.8, 7.8 and 53.5 FG%. In two games with two days of rest, he averaged 18.0, 7.5 and 41.7 FG%. 3. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 18.3 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 3.5 apg Season stats: 18.6 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 4.0 apg If rest is the key for Aldridge, then location is the key for Gasol, at least over the last two weeks. In two home games, he averaged 23.5 points, 12.5 rebounds and 51.4 FG%. In four road games, Gasol went for 15.8, 8.8 and 31.7 FG%. We\u2019ve been more impressed with the defense, as Gasol has blocked three or more shots in three of the last four. 4. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 19.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 7.3 apg Season stats: 17.1 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 9.0 apg The injury bug has struck Paul once again, this time a left adductor strain that has kept him on the shelf for the last three games. Before going down, Paul managed two games of 25 or more points as well as a triple-double \u2014 his first of the season. In fact, Paul had just one triple-double all of last season and none the year before that. 5. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 12.1 ppg, 12.0 rpg, 1.9 apg Season stats: 15.5 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.3 apg If not for last Friday\u2019s game in which Howard played just five minutes before leaving with a dislocated finger, it would have been another solid two-week stint for Howard. If you toss out that game, the big man managed four double-doubles with four games of 15 or more rebounds. For good measure, he even shot 64.7 from the free-throw line (53.8 for the season). 6. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 9 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 17.0 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 1.8 apg Season stats: 17.6 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.6 apg Off-the-ball Anthony seems to be doing just fine. A new role in the Thunder\u2019s offense has seen the veteran forward go for 16 or more points in five straight games while connecting on two or more 3-pointers in four of the last five. Oh, and it\u2019s probably no coincidence that Oklahoma City has won six straight. 7. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 16.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.4 apg Season stats: 15.5 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 2.3 apg For just the second time this season, Randolph had back-to-back 20-plus games, going for 27 on Dec. 19 and 21 on Dec. 20. Z-Bo now has seven games this season of 20 or more points. He had 10 such games all of last season. The big man continues to shoot at his best mark (50.8 FG%) since 2002-03 when he shot 51.3. 8. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.9 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 0.6 apg Season stats: 11.8 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.3 apg After securing double-doubles in three straight and seven in his previous 11 games, Gibson has gone six straight without one. That has the worry meter teetering a tad. Of course he\u2019s still scoring, pouring in 20 or more in two of his last three while shooting a blistering 68.6 from the field over the last seven. But something has been off at the line (58.3 FT%). 9. Dirk Nowitzki (39), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 15.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.8 apg Look who makes a return to the chase. That\u2019ll happen when you score in double figures in five straight, with three of those being 18 or more points. Nowitzki also has nailed at least one trey in eight straight, including an impressive 6-for-15 in last Friday\u2019s game against Miami. He continues to connect from long range at a career-best 42.4. 10. J.J. Barea (33), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 11.0 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 7.1 apg Season stats: 12.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.8 apg For the fourth time this season and first since Dec. 2, Barea turned in a game with 10 or more assists, finishing with 12 (and 15 points) in Saturday\u2019s loss to Atlanta. The point guard continues to put up solid numbers (career-best 12.0 points and 5.8 assists) despite averaging just 22.9 minutes per game. Just missed the cut: Courtney Lee, Trevor Ariza, Jamal Crawford, J.J. Redick, Pau Gasol Will turn 32 this season: Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George thought the latter should have twice disqualified his game-winning basket on Friday night . Milwaukee\u2019s young star forward drove baseline in the final seconds, squeezed past Thunder swingman Josh Huestis and dunked over Russell Westbrook with 0.9 seconds remaining to put the Bucks up 97-95. Later on Twitter, George rose a social media eyebrow over two potential non-calls, wondering aloud if Antetokounmpo had stepped out of bounds or traveled en route to the points that proved the difference.

When that will take, precisely, remains a bit of an unknown as he continues his recovery from a torn labrum. The last reports circulating about Thomas had him potentially returning to the lineup in early January . Just a week ago, Thomas worked out with the Cavs\u2019 G League affiliate , the Canton Charge, to get some on-court practice time as his recovery efforts continue. He was in uniform for last week\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls \u2014 but did not play \u2014 and has been in a similar state for the Cavs\u2019 games since then. According to Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com, the team is unsure if Thomas will suit up for a Jan. 2 road game against the Boston Celtics ( 8 ET, ESPN ). That game would be particularly relevant as it would not only be Thomas\u2019 first game of 2017-18, but would pit him against the team that traded him in the offseason for the Cavs\u2019 Kyrie Irving . At Friday\u2019s practice, Thomas told the media he tried to force the Cavs to play him on Wednesday night, but they denied his request. As Vardon reports, the Cavs have yet to set a definitive date for Thomas\u2019 return , and coach Tyronn Lue yesterday seemed to hedge on whether or not Thomas would play in Saturday\u2019s road game against the Utah Jazz ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Cavs and Thomas himself, Vardon writes, have been reluctant to have his first game back come against a marquee opponent. In line with that thinking, Thomas sat out on Christmas Day against the Golden State Warriors and he could sit out against Boston, too. Dave McMenamin of ESPN.com notes that the Cavs are looking forward to their practice in Napa, Calif., on Friday for a multitude of reasons. As for Thomas, writes McMenamin, he will be on a minutes restriction whenever he returns to the lineup :"},{"id":48129,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mvp-ladder-2017-18-week-11-lebron-james-kevin-durant-giving-chase","date":"2017-12-29","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: LeBron James, Kevin Durant not about to fade in chase","content":" The two-man race that became the case for the Kia MVP last season \u2014 when Russell Westbrook outpaced James Harden at the finish \u2014 appears to be a bit more crowded as this NBA season crosses over from calendar year 2017 to 2018. Harden and Russell remain in the mix, the former at the top of the final Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of 2017 and the latter just outside of the top five. This time a year ago, the former Thunder teammates had already created some space between themselves and the rest of the field. * Kia MVP Ladder (Dec. 22):  Christmas a showcase for MVP types But there are two other familiar faces that could provide the real intrigue moving forward. Four-time Kia MVP LeBron James and 2014 Kia MVP Kevin Durant are tied at No. 2 this week and coming off yet another Durant win in their ongoing head-to-head battles in the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Christmas Day win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. For anyone keeping score, that\u2019s a 6-2 head-to-head edge in games to Durant, The Finals included, since he joined the Warriors. LeBron isn\u2019t ready to pass any torch to Durant, Harden, Westbrook (No. 6 this week), teammate-turned-foe Kyrie Irving (No. 4), Central Division rival Giannis Antetokounmpo (No. 5) or anyone else. His performance in the months leading up to his 33rd birthday (Saturday) have shown him to be anything but willing to cede his position as the \u201cbest player on the planet.\u201d Both he and Durant will welcome their All-Star point guards to the mix in the coming days, adding yet another layer to this evolving story as Isaiah Thomas makes his Cavaliers debut and Curry comes back from a sprained ankle that has sidelined him since Dec. 6. We already know what the Durant-Curry dynamic looks like \u2026 it\u2019s championship-level great. LeBron and Thomas have their chemistry to work on and develop, but the expectation is that eventually they will function much like LeBron and Kyrie did during their three seasons together. That means the 2018 portion of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder should deliver plenty of twists and turns between now and mid-April, when we could all witness a much more crowded photo finish for the crown. * * * The top five in the Week 11 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking :  No. 1 Season stats:  32.4 points, 9.2 assists, 5.2 rebounds Harden must have gotten his dates mixed up this year. Christmas was Monday, on the 25th like always. But Harden was still giving away presents Thursday night in Boston. His two offensive fouls in the final seven seconds of a game the Rockets led by 26 points will go down as one of the strangest finishes of the season to date (Boston\u2019s Dec. 18 win in Indiana, courtesy of a Terry Rozier steal and dunk in the finals second, is an extremely close second). Harden\u2019s 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds were wasted in a game the Rockets simply could not put away, due in large part to the final two of Harden\u2019s eight giveaways. The Rockets have now lost four straight, despite Harden\u2019s 41.2 points, 10.2 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game during that stretch. They are clearly on the other side of the hoops karma that saw them win 14 straight prior to this current tailspin. And you know John Wall and Bradley Beal can\u2019t wait to take their shots at them tonight at Capital One Arena ( 7 ET, NBA TV ). Last week\u2019s ranking :  No. 3 Season stats:  26.1 points, 7.1 rebounds, 5.1 assists Durant\u2019s ride without Stephen Curry healthy and in uniform is coming to an end, the Warriors have targeted Saturday\u2019s game vs. Memphis as his return from his ankle injury. That means tonight\u2019s game against Charlotte at Oracle Arena ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) could be the last reminder of what Durant can do as the anchor for this team since Curry went down on Dec. 6. That 10-game sample for Durant \u2014 29.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists per game and a game-changing 3.1 blocks per game \u2014 could wind up being the strongest evidence yet that he is deserving of the top spot on this list. As much fun as it has been watching Durant go off like this, it is easy to forget how good these Warriors are as individuals sometimes. Warriors coach Steve Kerr surely wants to see his bunch back at full strength. Last week\u2019s ranking :  No. 2 Season stats:  27.8 points, 9.3 assists, 8.2 rebounds LeBron\u2019s 33rd birthday week didn\u2019t start the way he wanted. Back-to-back losses to the Golden State Warriors on Christmas followed by a rough outing (he did record a triple-double \u2014 but shot just 6-for-17 from the floor) in a loss at Sacramento Wednesday . LeBron will get a chance to get his groove back on his birthday Saturday night in Utah ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). And after suffering back-to-back losses for the first time since Nov. 1, you better believe he will try to blow out the candles on the Jazz with a signature performance. He\u2019ll get some relief in the near future with All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas getting closer to make his Cavaliers debut . Then, and only then, will we know exactly how that dynamic between the two stars will work this season. If LeBron can maintain his December production \u2014 27.4 points, 10.6 assists and 8.2 rebounds \u2014 things will be just fine for the Cavaliers in 2018. Last week\u2019s ranking :  No. 4 Season stats:  24.6 points, 5.0 assists, 2.9 rebounds Maybe there is just a little of that early-season magic left in these Celtics after all. Irving helped the home team battle back from a 26-point deficit Thursday night to steal one from James Harden and the Houston Rockets. Irving\u2019s 26 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals proved crucial for a Celtics team desperate to piece together back-to-back wins (they won on the road in Charlotte Wednesday) after humbled a bit lately. Irving\u2019s leadership has also been huge for the young Celtics, who have reclaimed the Eastern Conference\u2019s top spot. He\u2019s going to finish off a wild 2017 with a new team, new responsibilities as the face of the franchise and a chance to potentially upset the order of things in the East for his old team. Irving\u2019s December numbers \u2014 26.6 points on 50 percent shooting (45.7 percent on 3-pointers) and 94.2 percent from the free throw line \u2014 were exactly what you\u2019d expect from one of the league true offensive assassins. But his improved effort and presence on defensive has been just as impressive. Last week\u2019s ranking :  No. 5 Season stats:  29.7 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists Bucks coach Jason Kidd grumbled earlier this week about expectations being a bit too high for what he termed Milwaukee\u2019s \u201cBig Three or Brew Three.\u201d But the internal expectations Antetekounmpo put on himself and his teammate this season seem to be just about right. Whatever the collective expectation is for this group since Eric Bledsoe arrived, there is no denying that Antetokounmpo has played up to his own hype. He hasn\u2019t been perfect, no one has, but he\u2019s carried a huge load for the Bucks all season. He\u2019s been on a tear this month \u2014 30.2 points on 54 percent shooting and 80.3 percent from the free throw line, 10.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.9 steals. But he\u2019s at his best when the Bucks need him most, like they did his 22 points, 10 rebounds and three assists as the Bucks rebounded from a brutal start and 20-point deficit to knock off the Minnesota Timberwolves at home Thursday night . The next five: 6. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 7. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 8. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 9. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 10. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers And five more \u2026: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola jokic, Denver Nuggets An Inside Look at Russell Westbrook from an Eastern Conference scout: \u201cYou don\u2019t have Russ in the top five? Seriously? Well, you better make room for him because he\u2019s rolling now and he\u2019s not going to stop. I told you that they were going to turn a corner around this time of the season. People have been talking about these guys since training camp, like they were supposed to have it figured out overnight. It takes time. But you cannot tell me Russ hasn\u2019t been one of the best players in the league to this point. And yes, I\u2019m a Russ guy, I love how hard he goes every single night. So he takes some bad shots. \u201cPeople act like Michael Jordan and Larry Bird and great players from other eras didn\u2019t take bad shots. Of course, they did. I think it\u2019s ridiculous the way he gets criticized, the standard he\u2019s being held to. I really do. You\u2019re asking him to go from being basically a one-man band to making it work with Carmelo [Anthony] and Paul George basically overnight. There\u2019s no way you figure that out on the fly. They needed time. A player like Russell was going to need some time to adjust and now that he\u2019s done that, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to slow down for anyone. He\u2019s right back near that triple-double level he was at last year. And when he\u2019s in attack mode and can kick it out to a spot up shooter of Carmelo\u2019s quality and another guy with Paul\u2019s range versatility, that\u2019s a different monster the Thunder are working with. I think they are just getting started. And it all starts with Russ. The same way people were banging on him when they were struggling, you\u2019ve got to give his due now. There\u2019s no way he is isn\u2019t in your top five.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Griffin missed the last 14 games because of a sprained left knee, which he sustained in a 120-115 victory against the Lakers on Nov. 27 . He was originally expected to miss eight weeks, but has made rapid progress in his rehabilitation. \u201cI just know his work ethic has to have something to do with it,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHe gets a lot of heat for getting injured, but no one gives him credit for getting healthy. He works his butt off like no one I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Griffin went through a thorough workout before the Clippers defeated the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday for their third win in the past four games. On Wednesday, he practiced with the Clippers G League affiliate, the Agua Caliente Clippers of Ontario, and rejoined his Los Angeles teammates for another practice Thursday. There were some mixed messages from the Clippers and Griffin after he talked with the media before Thursday\u2019s practice about his return. According to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times , Griffin offered up an \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked if he was ready to play. Then came an \u201cit\u2019s a good day\u201d, which indicated the possibility of a return Friday vs. the Lakers. Lastly, after practice, the Clippers listed Griffin as questionable for the Lakers game. Here\u2019s more from Turner on what may lie ahead for Griffin : Griffin also added that he was glad his injury did not require surgery and, now, he\u2019s just ready to get back in the lineup. Griffin is averaging 21.7 points and 9.1 rebounds in 26 career games against Los Angeles. He\u2019s shooting 51.7 percent from the floor and 15 for 33 from 3-point range in those games. The Clippers (14-19) have won 20 of their past 22 games against the Lakers dating to the start of the 2012-13 season. In addition to the win on Nov. 27, the Clippers beat the Lakers 108-92 in the season opener. The Lakers (11-22) remain without two injured starters, rookie point guard Lonzo Ball (sprained shoulder) and veteran center Brook Lopez (sprained ankle), and have lost four straight and seven of their past eight. Brandon Ingram returned Wednesday after missing two games with injuries to his quads and the team\u2019s second-leading scorer (16.3) produced 23 points in 44 minutes of a 109-99 loss to the visiting Memphis Grizzlies. Lakers leading scorer Kyle Kuzma (17.8) took a season-high 24 shots against Memphis, but the rookie forward made just four, perhaps showing fatigue after playing at least 40 minutes in four of the previous five games. Kuzma is listed as questionable for Friday\u2019s game because of a quad injury. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was tired going into the game, but he\u2019s played a lot of minutes, and here we are getting to the dog days of an NBA season,\u201d Lakers coach Walton said after the game. \u201cHe\u2019s a rookie. He\u2019s never gone through this before. He\u2019s playing a lot of minutes, taking a beating every night, so fatigue is always a factor.\u201d Kuzma said fatigue was not a factor in his performance Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make an excuse, basketball is basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cShots just didn\u2019t fall.\u201d Six of the past seven losses for the Lakers have been by 10 points or less, and several of those outcomes would likely be different if they shot better from the free-throw line. Los Angeles has combined to miss 67 free throws in the past seven games, shooting 64.2 percent from the line in that span to drop its season mark to 68.9, last in the NBA. \u201cIndividually, we\u2019re shooting hundreds of free throws in practice,\u201d Lakers forward Larry Nance Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things that we\u2019re working, we\u2019re drilling it, and it doesn\u2019t get better overnight.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":48152,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oklahoma-city-thunder-working-fix-third-quarter-issues","date":"2017-12-29","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder slowly fixing their third-quarter woes","content":"The Oklahoma City Thunder are the hottest team in the league, having won six straight and nine of their last 11 games.

The last time Carter scored that many points in a game was on March 13 of last season, when he had 24 points for the Memphis Grizzlies in a 113-93 win against the Milwaukee Bucks.

The league\u2019s Last Two Minute Report , which evaluates each officiating call and non-call over the final 120 seconds of the game, revealed that LeBron James was indeed fouled by Kevin Durant during the final possessions of the contest. The report states that Durant fouled James three times in that span, including twice on a James drive with under 30 seconds remaining. James said as much after the game, telling reporters, \u201cHe fouled me twice, but whatever. What are you going to do about it?\u201d Durant responded by saying James is \u201ctoo big for that. He\u2019s too big. That ain\u2019t no foul.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s practice, Durant discussed the findings from the Last Two Minute Report. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the outcome, it doesn\u2019t change what happened in the rest of the game,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just two minutes to play basketball. But, I can see why they made those calls and came up with that report. I understand it\u2019s a physical game and they can miss some calls.\u201d Teammate Draymond Green called Last Two Minute Reports \u201cpointless\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s practice and said that too many observers think they know what is happening on the court. \u201cIn the NBA and basketball in general, people think they\u2019ve got all the answers,\u201d Green said. \u201cAnd so, with people that think they\u2019ve got all the answers, they don\u2019t know how to dissect the game of basketball. \u201cFor instance, there\u2019s this thought of like, \u2018aw man, you turned the ball over with four seconds to go. You lost, you\u2019re out of the game.\u2019 No you didn\u2019t. That game was lost in the third quarter, that game was lost in the second quarter, that turnover you had in the third quarter matters just as much as the turnover in the fourth quarter. But people don\u2019t view it that way.\u201d Green wondered why only the last two minutes of the game are judged and not the rest of it with equal scrutiny. \u201cWhy would you judge just the last two minutes of the game? What about the call that was missed in the first quarter? What about the call that was missed in the third quarter? That call could have started a whole run for them and changed the entire game.\u201d"},{"id":48148,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-teams-release-2017-18-city-edition-uniforms","date":"2017-12-27","title":"NBA teams release City Edition uniforms","content":"NBA teams saw their uniforms undergo an overhaul of sorts with the new Nike sponsorship deal that kicked in this season.

The Cavs are also without Derrick Rose, who has been dealing with a sprained left ankle for much of his first season with the team. Rose left the Cavs from Nov. 22 until Dec. 4, opting for a self-imposed separation to ponder his basketball future.

That\u2019s the second strangest thing about someone who is averaging nearly 25 points a night . You can\u2019t find many kids on the playgrounds copying his style, or pro hopefuls studying his highlight clips, and NBA coaches are steering their players far, far away from his influence. Imagine that: He\u2019s an All-Star making $27 million a season and is beloved by the team he plays for and the city he reps, which means he must be doing something right. Yet he walks virtually alone in this game. Which leads to the first and obvious thing that\u2019s immediately apparent about DeMar DeRozan, the Eastern Conference Player of the Week : He\u2019s one of the few NBA players at the swing position who embraces the mid-range shot as his primary weapon . A neat coincidence, then, that the leading scorer of the Toronto Raptors is, in some ways, a dinosaur. \u201cDoes that mean my type is becoming extinct?\u201d he said, laughing. In today\u2019s game, that would be accurate, yes. And sadly so. DeRozan hasn\u2019t changed since he first picked up a basketball; the world around him changed just before he arrived in the 2009 Draft as the No. 9 pick. The basketball court expanded and everyone caught 3-point fever over the last several years. It\u2019s a copycat league, and with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets using the 3-pointer to massive success, others are simply falling in line and hoping (and mostly failing) to duplicate that. Meanwhile, the gap on the floor that\u2019s 12- to 20-feet from the rim gets 2 a.m. traffic. The fans are obviously in favor of the three and the league approves anything that gets eyeballs. The 3-pointer has generated excitement and allows teams to rally from big deficits, which is fine. But why has the NBA abandoned the mid-range, and is that really good for the game when everyone plays the same way \u2014 take shots from deep or at the rim but nothing in between? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to bat with your strengths,\u201d said DeRozan. \u201cI grew up watching old school basketball and I came into the league like that. A lot of these young guys are watching the league in a whole different dynamic than what we had. It just come with the times.\u201d It\u2019s rather silly when you consider it, because part of the problem is too many wanna-be\u2019s who are hitting 32 percent from deep are trying to match Stephen Curry\u2019s brilliance, when it\u2019s probably easier, and nearly as lucrative, to follow the DeRozan blueprint. The game could use more offensive balance, players who can back their man down, sink the baseline 18-footer and most important, draw contact and get to the free throw line. But coaches and general managers, drunk on analytics, are either too afraid to break from the trend or not creative enough to design an offense that showcases both the long-distance shooter and the mid-range specialist. The league is on pace this season to attempt the fewest number of shots defined as \u201cmid-range\u201d since those stats were first kept in 1996-97. It\u2019s now at 19 percent, which would drop under the previous single-season low of 22 percent last season, and far below 38 percent in 1999-2000. Because of that, it\u2019s a good bet that waves of teenagers with pro aspirations and potential are junking the mid-range game altogether for 3-point shooting, since that\u2019s the message being sent by the NBA. When the ball finds them 18 feet from the basket, some are uncomfortable and rattled. The Rockets, for example, are exclusively built for 3-point shooting. Eric Gordon shoots 9.3 3-pointers and 4.5 two-pointers per game . James Harden is roughly at 50-50 on 3-pointers and twos. And then there\u2019s Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson, the extremes who are 80-20 on 3-pointers vs. twos. It\u2019s not uncommon for Ariza to ignore a clear path to the basket in favor of an open 3-pointer. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni bans his designated long shooters from doing anything but 3-pointers and layups. In an ironic twist, DeRozan\u2019s own team makes little time for mid-range shots in practice and the Raptors are definitely the norm in that regard, not the exception. \u201cWhy are we working on shots we don\u2019t want to shoot?\u201d said coach Dwane Casey, echoing the thoughts of many of his fellow coaches. \u201cWe practice 3s, attack and kick out. We rarely work on mid-range shots, definitely not as a team. We don\u2019t work on shots we don\u2019t want to take.\u201d Even DeRozan has enhanced his game this season by becoming a more active and accurate shooter from deep. In recent back-to-back games against the Philadelphia 76ers (one in which he dropped 45 points) he took a combined 16 shots from deep. That matched the number he took in his entire rookie season. Only once in his career has DeRozan averaged more than two 3-pointers a game ( 2013-14 ), and he\u2019s on pace to average three 3-pointers this season \u2014 a massive leap for him. But his money maker remains the 18-footer , where he uses his body wisely to create space and a pump-fake to draw contact and get to the line. DeRozan has averaged eight free throw attempts per game over the last five seasons \u2014 only Harden and DeMarcus Cousins have taken more. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Tony Thomas. \u201cIs there something I\u2019m missing here?\u201d Thomas was DeRozan\u2019s high school coach in Compton. He never tried to transform DeRozan\u2019s game or instincts. Thomas encouraged DeRozan to follow his own path even while colleges and the pros were busy loading up on players who shoot 3-pointers. DeRozan\u2019s favorite drill was spreading trash cans on several spots on the court, then dribbling around and shooting over them. DeRozan learned how to save his release until he reached his highest point on his vertical leap, which allowed him to challenge taller players when contested on 18-footers. \u201cPlus, the high school 3-pointer is an NBA mid-range,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cHe shot threes in high school but stayed there.\u201d Thomas said the added value of drawing contact and shooting free throws made the mid-range a better option for DeRozan, who\u2019s an 82-percent shooter from the line. \u201cYou\u2019re always in attack mode,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole purpose. You\u2019re scoring with the clock moving and also scoring when the clock\u2019s not moving at the free throw line. The best of both worlds. He can use his strength and post up smaller guys and his dribble to keep the bigger guys off balance.\u201d Thomas said he doesn\u2019t stress the 3-pointer on his high school teams unless someone shows plenty of potential. \u201cWhen you\u2019re open I don\u2019t mind you taking a three, but the way these guys jack up these threes now, it\u2019s a bad shot,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s an open shot, it\u2019s a bad percentage shot unless you\u2019re shooting 40 percent, because when you miss, that\u2019s a fast break opportunity the other way.\u201d DeRozan said about Thomas: \u201cHe let me be and I ran with it.\u201d In his only season at USC, DeRozan took just six 3-pointers. His explosiveness and mid-range shot made him a top-10 pick but the league was rapidly gravitating toward guards with greater shooting range. DeRozan\u2019s carbon copy in the league was Dwyane Wade, a future Hall of Famer whose style somehow didn\u2019t rub off on the next generation. DeRozan improved his dribble and shot selection to put himself among the most efficient (if not best) guards in the NBA. His biggest year came after he signed the big contract two summers ago: 27.3 points last season . Teammate Kyle Lowry is more accurate from deep and therefore the primary 3-point option in the final seconds, but DeRozan\u2019s confidence is growing behind the arc. \u201cWhen he gets that volume up, then he\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d said Lowry.  DeRozan\u2019s newfound growth as a 3-point shooter is a big change to his game, but he warns against anyone thinking he\u2019ll suddenly and drastically change with the times. He subscribes to the great philosopher Charles Barkley, who said, ever so delicately: \u201cIf you\u2019re a great 3-point shooter, then shoot threes. But everybody can\u2019t be a 3-point shooter. You don\u2019t have to shoot threes because everyone else is doing it. That\u2019s a bunch of crap.\u201d That\u2019s sound advice for a pair of intriguing rookies cursed with freaky shooting mechanics and are clunky (so far) from beyond the arc: Ben Simmons and Lonzo Ball. When you\u2019re under 30 percent, what\u2019s wrong with moving a few feet inside the line? What\u2019s so wrong with being DeMar DeRozan? Nothing, says DeRozan. If anything, he enjoys being a hopeless throwback and standing out from the pack. \u201cIt\u2019s really an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of my favorite players growing up were great mid-range shooters. If they could do it, why can\u2019t I? Does it make a difference that I\u2019m shooting twos when people are going crazy about threes? And does it help my team? That\u2019s all that really matters, anyway.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

I\u2019m going to take a different tack and say Kyrie Irving. Think about everything that went haywire because one guy \u2014 Irving \u2014 decided he didn\u2019t want to play with LeBron James any more . Everybody wants to play with LeBron James. But in part because of Irving\u2019s decision, the Cleveland Cavaliers weren\u2019t able to add Jimmy Butler or Paul George, and Cleveland had to ship its 25-year-old future to its biggest Eastern Conference rival to get anything approaching equal value for him. Does anyone doubt that LeBron would have already extended in Cleveland by now if Irving and either or Butler or George were there with him? As I said at the time, I thought Irving was nuts for demanding to be traded \u2014 but I\u2019m not 25, and I didn\u2019t hit the shot that brought Cleveland its first major sports championship in 50-plus years. From his perspective, I kind of understood why he wanted out, and his play so far in Boston proves his point \u2014 he would have never had this kind of freedom, both on the court and to lead his team, in James\u2019 shadow in Cleveland. Steve Aschburner : An obvious choice would be LeBron James for how he stands astride NBA world in matters on the court and off. Isaiah Thomas embodied much of what players face, good and bad, from performances worthy of Kia MVP consideration to the tumult of getting traded to the disruption of careers and goals by injury. But I\u2019ll go with Kevin Durant as 2017\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d for having his hand in so many storylines. He won himself a ring, without earning respect or enhancing his reputation because of how he got it \u2014 about as bloodlessly as buying a bunch of Apple stock. His departure from OKC ignited Russell Westbrook, which culminated in the calendar year with Westbrook\u2019s historic triple-double season , a Kia MVP award and a long-term commitment to the fans Durant left. There\u2019s Durant\u2019s growing game and climb toward James\u2019 status as the league\u2019s best player. And there\u2019s his increasingly prickly attitude, which makes him less nice as a guy but maybe interesting as a case study of success. Shaun Powell :  Kevin Durant walks away with this prize. He combined brilliance and a championship with polarization. The best player on the floor in The 2017 Finals was also mocked in some public corners for hitching a ride on the Warriors train and being hypersensitive to any and all criticism. Inside the body of a true superstar is a nice guy who is desperate to be loved. In his entire charmed basketball life, Durant never heard the level of boos and hisses that followed his departure from OKC and it rattled him to the bone. John Schuhmann :  Mike D\u2019Antoni. The 2016-17 season was the most efficient offensive season we\u2019ve ever had, and \u201917-18 is on track to top it. In The Finals, with the traditional bigs on the rosters seeing their playing time reduced as the series went on, the Cavs and Warriors combined for an effective field goal percentage of 57 percent (a mark higher than any team has ever recorded in a season in NBA history) over the final four games. Teams are spacing the floor better and shooting 3-pointers more than ever before. There are a lot of people who have pushed that trend along, but none more than D\u2019Antoni, architect of the seven-seconds-or-less Suns and coach of the team that\u2019s now taking more than half of its shots from beyond the arc.  Sekou Smith : As much as this year was about Kevin Durant finally cashing in his chips for a title and the Warriors winning it all again, I can\u2019t help but think about the year LeBron James has enjoyed\/endured. Some 15 years deep into his unbelievable career and he\u2019s still sitting atop the heap. He doesn\u2019t need team (Durant and Stephen Curry took care of that) or individual hardware (Russell Westbrook snagged that) to validate his position, either. That is pretty remarkable in our what-have-you-done-lately era of sports (and life in general). The seventh straight trip to The Finals and the summertime break up with Kyrie Irving stick out as well. The fact is, LeBron\u2019s impact on and off the court, his influence on the game and his reach and position in the culture beyond the game transcendent. His fearlessness when it comes to speaking his mind on social and political issues is perhaps the most memorable thing he\u2019s done this year, the thing history will highlight most in retrospect."},{"id":48154,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-takeaway-warriors-cavaliers-christmas-day-showdown","date":"2017-12-27","title":"Blogtable: Biggest takeaway from Golden State Warriors-Cleveland Cavaliers showdown?","content":"* * * Your biggest takeaway from Cavs-Warriors on Christmas Day ?  * * * David Aldridge :  I thought Kevin Love was damn good at center, even though he was just 9 of 25 from the floor. He\u2019s made it clear he\u2019d rather go back to power forward, but if Cleveland can be effective against the Warriors (admittedly different without Stephen Curry on the floor) with a small-ball lineup, that augers well for matchups down the road, if you get my meaning. But you wonder if Love can hold up in the hole over 82 games and two months of playoffs. Steve Aschburner : I was reminded of Golden State\u2019s defensive prowess . Beyond holding the Cavaliers in double digits scoring with a shooting percentage that wouldn\u2019t even win a batting title, the Warriors rank at the top of the NBA in defensive rating (100.8), in opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage (42.8) and in blocked shots (8.6 per game). As accomplished as the defending champs are offensively, do they really need to excel at the other end like this? Could be, opponents help to discombobulate themselves in their panic to score with the Warriors. But it happens too often, against too many different coaches, players and strategies, and it\u2019s gone on too long not to be real. Shaun Powell :  Really didn\u2019t put much stock into a game without Steph Curry, even though rookie Jordan Bell could see solid minutes come the playoffs. That\u2019s how much he\u2019s grown. My takeaway is the continuing marvel of 33-year-old LeBron James at this stage of his career. He\u2019s indestructible and once more a strong favorite for MVP (how many years running now?). To say that no player was ever better in his 15th season of basketball than LeBron needs some clarification; had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar gone to the NBA straight from high school, he\u2019d be just as good ( 26.2 points per game, 10.3 rebounds per game and 2.9 blocks per game at age 33 ). But what we\u2019re seeing from LeBron is not normal, folks. Not even close. John Schuhmann : There\u2019s not much to take away in regard to the matchup. Given Monday\u2019s absences, the Jan. 15 game in Cleveland, when Stephen Curry and Isaiah Thomas will hopefully be in the starting lineups, should be more relevant. But rookie Jordan Bell getting the start and 26-plus minutes of playing time (including minutes down the stretch of a close game) when Zaza Pachulia was healthy is a noteworthy development. Bell is the center of the future for the Warriors and it may be that the future is now, giving them a little more defensive versatility and rim protection. Sekou Smith :  My biggest takeaway from the latest edition of Cavaliers-Warriors is that we don\u2019t know what this rivalry will look like in The Finals. (This assumes they both make it there for a fourth straight season). There was no Stephen Curry or Isaiah Thomas in the mix on Christmas and both teams play vastly different when Curry and Thomas suit up. That makes it hard to judge them off one game without two players so critical to the potential outcome of a best-of-seven series. As much as the Kevin Durant vs. LeBron James matchup will color that potential series, Curry vs. Thomas would be just as crucial. We know the Warriors are a juggernaut when healthy, focused and sniffing another championship. We don\u2019t know for sure what these Cavaliers will be like in a similar state with Thomas around \u2026 but I\u2019m guessing it is much the same."},{"id":42611,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-monty-mccutchen-biggest-challenges-head-referee-development-and","date":"2017-12-27","title":"Blogtable: Biggest challenges Monty McCutchen faces as NBA's head of referee development?","content":" * * * The NBA recently pulled referee Monty McCutchen from the active pool of officials and made him the head of referee development and training . What do you see as the biggest challenges or issues facing McCutchen right now?  * * * David Aldridge : That there aren\u2019t more Monty McCutchens in the pipeline to take his place as the NBA\u2019s best referee. This isn\u2019t the usual insipid conspiracy theory talk you hear from fans of every team around playoff time. I think the officiating in the NBA, on average, is pretty solid. And I certainly don\u2019t see the grudges and\/or feuds that players had with refs back in the day, when it was clear a certain ref wasn\u2019t going to give a certain player a fair shake. But just about all of the top veteran guys have left in the last few years: Joey Crawford, Danny Crawford, Bob Delaney, Steve Javie and Bennett Salvatore. You weren\u2019t worried about a playoff or Finals game when they were out there (and, again, I know that there are fans who have beefs with each one of them for one reason or another). There are several good refs who\u2019ve worked Finals in the last few years: Zach Zarba, Tony Brothers, Mike Callahan (and, yes, I know he and his fellow refs didn\u2019t have a great night in Game 4 of The Finals) and Derrick Stafford. But as the referee pool has gotten younger over the past few years \u2014 a necessity, to be sure \u2014 there are complaints from players and coaches that there\u2019s less flexibility among some of the younger refs, who won\u2019t let people question calls and\/or let off steam, another necessity that veteran refs understood. It\u2019s not \u201cshowing up\u201d a ref to think they got a call wrong, or at least ask them what they saw. The communication gap between some \u2014 some \u2014 refs and players and coaches needs to be closed. Steve Aschburner : Monty McCutchen\u2019s biggest challenge, in my opinion, is that  he\u2019s got a work force with a morale problem. Few workers in our society are as poked, prodded and second-guessed as NBA referees, who face heavy scrutiny long before and after the opening tap and the final horn. There are the in-game replays, the L2M reports the day after and all their individual performance reviews. A lack of trust with league HQ has been rattling around for years as management\u2019s policing tactics and executive ranks have changed. The recent move by the players union, asking for a sit-down to complain about some refs\u2019 alleged harshness and dismissiveness, felt like piling on an already beleaguered group, all because some players\u2019 feelings were bruised. Yes, the refs are paid well. But they\u2019ve been catching hell from all sides, and McCutchen might want to start there. Shaun Powell :  The biggest issue is one that follows every head of officiating: How can you train referees to make accurate judgments on a fast-paced game that involves a degree of contact? There\u2019s no harder game to ref than the NBA and maybe McCutchen might want to press the league office on hiring a fourth ref. (My biggest pet peeve is referees refusing to call palming violations and also allowing players to take a step-and-a-half and then a hop before shooting or passing off. But that genie is out of the bottle.) John Schuhmann :  As McCutchen improves the quality of NBA officiating as a whole, consistency should be a priority. Consistency from ref to ref, as well as consistency from player to player, from game to game, and from the first minute of the first quarter to the last minute of the fourth. And let\u2019s crack down on discontinued dribbles, too.  Sekou Smith :  The biggest issue these days isn\u2019t rules-related but relationship-related. Finding a way to cool off players and officials going at each other during the course of games has been the biggest officiating problem for years now. We\u2019ve seen it again already this season with the rash of ejections, Shaun Livingston and Courtney Kirkland going head-to-head and plenty of other instances where the player-official relationship got out of hand. It\u2019s a bad look all around and sets the tone for the way players and officials react to each other all the way down to the grassroots level. Anyone charged with developing and training officials need to make repairing that relationship is a top priority.

The Miami Heat guard missed his second straight game Tuesday because of a recurrence of the sprain that kept him off the floor for the final 13 games of last season. There\u2019s no timetable for his return, though Waiters he does not expect this absence to be like the month he missed when he first sprained the ankle last March. The ankle never fully healed, and Waiters has been dealing with it all season. \u201cI\u2019ve played through it, though,\u201d Waiters said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It is what it is. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t like to talk about because there\u2019s nothing we really can do right now but try to take care of it, get it stronger, things like that. I don\u2019t want to be in this predicament where it\u2019s a little tweak you\u2019ve got to miss a decent amount just off a little tweak.

The Heat share Waiters\u2019 optimism of a quick return to the lineup. He got hurt early in Miami\u2019s game against Dallas on Friday on a drive in the lane where the ankle just appeared to give way, then sat out against New Orleans on Saturday and was inactive for Tuesday\u2019s game with Orlando. \u201cHe will continue to do rehab, treatment and conditioning and see when we can get him back on the court,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is as bad \u2013 but I\u2019m also not a trainer or a doctor.\u201d Waiters considered surgery last summer, deciding against it because he would not have been ready for the start of this season.

I just twisted it.\u201d The Heat have been dealing with plenty of injury woes all season. Hassan Whiteside returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing 11 games with a bone bruise in his knee, Justise Winslow remains out with a knee strain, Goran Dragic is playing through elbow pain and James Johnson missed a week with right ankle bursitis \u2013 and is now out again with a flare-up of the same problem.

From Dana Tofig : You are correct on your first question, Dana: the Knicks are exactly one game better through 32 games this season than they were last season. But I certainly believe they\u2019ll finish better than 31-51 this year, assuming injuries don\u2019t consume the Unicorn and their other key rotation guys. Enes Kanter has been a very solid presence in the middle compared to last season, when the Knicks had to trot out a game but inexperienced and undersized Willy Hernangomez at center for long stretches after Joakim Noah was lost for the season. Assuming Tim Hardaway, Jr., returns next month, New York should get solid scoring nightly at two guard, and what can you say about Michael Beasley\u2019s production of late? I can tell you that while it\u2019s never a bad thing to make the playoffs, that wasn\u2019t the long-term plan going into the season. It\u2019s probably best for the Knicks to gamely fight for but ultimately fail to get that eighth playoff spot, and fade just enough late in the season not to be stuck in the late portion of the Lottery. There\u2019s a significant dropoff in the quality of the \u201918 Draft after the first four or five guys, according to most of the birddogs I speak with. Hot Tub Time Machine, Part III. From Mike Chamerinik : Good question, Mike. It\u2019s hard to believe Houston would be better than it\u2019s been so far, but I don\u2019t believe the Rockets would be much worse. You\u2019d have to assume the Rockets traded Ryan Anderson as part of the deal, though, and while Anderson\u2019s still inexplicably shooting much better from deep on the road at home, he\u2019s still shooting better from deep than Anthony, and 3s are the whole thing in Houston. Yet James Harden creates so much space for his teammates, there\u2019s no telling how much better \u2018Melo\u2019s numbers would be if he was playing off of him rather than Russell Westbrook. I guess that\u2019s a long was of saying I don\u2019t think the West would look a whole lot different with Anthony in Houston rather than OKC: the Rockets would probably have the best record in the West, or second-best, maybe. This is what we mean by snark, people! From Jeff Pryor : So\u2026I take it you didn\u2019t agree with the call, Jeff? Send your questions, comments and koalas settling things, Phascolarctos cinereus a Phascolarctos cinereus to daldridgetnt@gmail.com . If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it (and peep the lady lamenting that the bear wrasslin\u2019 is going to make her late for work)! (Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (42.7 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg, .500 FG, .894): First player since Wilt Chamberlain in 1962-63 to post back-to-back 50-point games that his team lost. Chamberlain \u2014 and, do yourself a favor, just go onto basketball-reference.com sometime and look up Chamberlain\u2019s Game Logs in the early \u201860s \u2014 scored 51 and 70 (!) points in back-to-back San Francisco Warriors losses on March 8 and 10, 1963. The crazy thing about that season for Chamberlain: that happened to him two other times that year, both of which involved three-game losing streaks! Wilt scored 59, 61 and 53 points in consecutive defeats from Nov. 18-23, 1962, and 53, 59 and 51 points in three straight losses from Nov. 29-Dec. 7, 1962. During that season, which was the year after Wilt scored 100 points in Hershey, PA, against the Knicks on March 2, 1962, Chamberlain had three games where he scored 70 or more points, six games where he scored 60 or better and 21 games with 50+ points. He averaged 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds that season, neither of which represented his highest single-season average. The Dipper was insane. 2) LeBron James (36.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 8 apg, .578 FG, 1.000 FT): The Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s columnist and great NBA historian\/author, Terry Pluto, pointed this out last week: James has never missed a playoff game in the 12 years his teams have made the postseason. That\u2019s 217 consecutive playoff games started and played since 2006, averaging 42 minutes per game. 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (26.5 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 6.5 apg, .500 FG, .900 FT): A Nike Signature shoe is the latest sign of dominance for the Greek Freak. 4) Kevin Durant (27.3 ppg, 8 rpg, 4.5 apg, .384 FG, .895 FT):  They didn\u2019t invite him to the after party . 5) Kyrie Irving (30 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 5 apg, .494 FG, .929 FT): Fine. Whatever you say, my man . I\u2019m not taking the bait on this one. 3 \u2014 Mavericks players with their jerseys retired, after the team announced that longtime point guard and current TV analyst Derek Harper will have his number 12 retired on Jan. 7. Harper will join Brad Davis (#15) and Rolando Blackman (#22) in the rafters at American Airlines Center, though one expects they\u2019ll be joined in due course by a certain German-born forward who wears #41. 0 \u2014 Home games that the Celtics had played on Christmas before today\u2019s game with the Wizards at TD Garden, per the league. This stuns me. Boston has played 30 Christmas games in its franchise\u2019s history \u2014 28 on the road, and two at a neutral site. The C\u2019s are just 13-17 in those marquee games over the years. $470,250 (est.)  \u2014 Amount that Washington\u2019s John Wall may have spent to buy each of his 15 teammates a Presidential Day-Date Rolex watch for Christmas . TMZ estimated the watches cost $40,000 apiece, based on its discussion with a jeweler, for a total outlay of $640,000; this site lists a retail price of $31,350 for the Presidential Day-Date Rolex (it\u2019s in the fine print; the $18,150 is the sale price). For purposes of this discussion, we\u2019ll go with the more conservative $31,350 price. That\u2019s still a lot of cheddar, and quite generous of Wall to include two-way guys Devin Robinson and Michael Young on the gift list \u2014 even if he does have that $207 million extension kicking in in 2019. 1) Watching Kobe Bryant get his number(s) raised to the rafters at Staples Center in person last week was terrific. The love affair between Bryant and the Lakers fans never was headed: not by his feud with Shaquille O\u2019Neal, not by the sexual assault charges filed against him in Colorado in 2004 (the charges were dropped later that year, though Bryant subsequently apologized to the woman who\u2019d accused him as part of the settlement of the case), not whatever happened in the second half of the deciding game of the Lakers\u2019 first-round series with Phoenix in 2005, when he only took three second-half shots, not his trade request in 2007, not his injuries or eventual decline as a player. They loved him, and the list of NBA lights that came out to watch \u2014 not just old Lakers teammates, but the likes of Allen Iverson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell \u2014 were testament to the respect Bryant had around the league. 2) You rarely see moments of genuine honesty and emotion. I\u2019m so proud that NBA TV produced one of those by getting Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas together again , to acknowledge the wrongs done and to seek forgiveness and reconciliation. Kudos \u2014 and, hopefully, Emmys \u2014 to everyone that was involved with pulling that off. 3) A lot of y\u2019all killed me for saying the Bulls didn\u2019t get as snookered in the Jimmy Butler deal as everyone seemed to think on Draft night last June . I\u2019m pouring tea now, Kermit style, and taking a sip : Dunn is starting at the point for Fred Hoiberg, averaging 12.8 points, 5.7 assists and 4.7 rebounds, and is shooting 35 percent on 3s. His net rating has fallen from the abysmal -19 he sported last season in Minnesota to a still-bad but much better -9 currently in Chicago. 4) Coming to a theatre near you : A Jerry Bruckheimer\/Dr. Seuss Production: 1) RIP, Dick Enberg , who was the genial voice of sports for those of us of a certain age growing up. I knew him best, and earliest, for his calls of college basketball \u2014 the Enberg-Billy Packer-Al McGuire booth was must-see TV before the term was invented. It was that trio that introduced most of the world to Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the 1979 NCAA championship game between Michigan State and Indiana State. But Enberg seemingly called everything else, too: Wimbledon, baseball, occasionally boxing \u2014 I recall vividly his broadcast of a Muhammad Ali TKO of England\u2019s Richard Dunn in 1976. Enberg called all of it for NBC for decades, before leaving the national scene and doing San Diego Padres games locally the last several years. And, by all accounts I\u2019ve seen, he was a pleasant and decent person to be around, not at all affected by his celebrity. What a remarkable, remarkable life. 2)  If he\u2019s genuine about following through and getting all the details down, competition is never a bad thing . I hope he\u2019s genuine about following through and getting all the details down, and not just looking for another way to promote his shoe brand. 3)  That turned quickly in Orlando, didn\u2019t it? With Nic Vucevic now out six to eight weeks, and Chicago\u2019s unlikely turnaround in December, the Magic\u2019s plummet to the bottom of the east is picking up warp speed. 4) Godspeed, production crew . * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The DeMar DeRozan we\u2019ve all come to know and love over the years was defiant in his refusal to shoot 3-pointers. When you\u2019re great at the elbows, and in the post, he\u2019d state firmly, why just follow the trend and float to the 3-point line? Why not dominate where you are dominant? And as he made Olympic and All-Star teams, with him and fellow All-Star\/Olympian Kyle Lowry playing the way they\u2019ve played for years, why change? And yet, last Thursday, there was DeRozan, in Philadelphia, ripping the nets from behind the arc like Klay Thompson. DeRozan was 6-for-9 on 3s, en route to a career-high 45 points, in leading the Raptors past the 76ers. Toronto shot 35 3s, and did so with a host of guys hoisting\u2014rookie O.G. Anunoby here, a Pascal Siakam there. Where the hell is Team Pick and Roll? And what is your demand for the safe return of my favorite iconoclast two guard? \u201cNo ransom,\u201d DeRozan said with a smile afterward. \u201cJust pull it out when you need it.\u201d Make no mistake, though \u2014 this is all by design, part of the \u201cculture reset\u201d that GM Masai Ujiri insisted upon after the Raptors were clubbed by the Cavs in a four-game second-round sweep in last year\u2019s playoffs, and that Coach Dwane Casey has implemented, seemingly seamlessly; after a middling start, Toronto has roared toward the top of the East standings. All the attention has been on the Celtics, but the Raptors are just a game behind them in the loss column, in second place in the East with a very favorable schedule in front of them. And they\u2019ve done it with an emphasis on ball movement and threes that has improved what was already a pretty potent offense. Toronto was sixth in the league in Offensive Rating (109.8 points per 100 possessions) playing the old way, so it\u2019s not like opposing defenses stuffed Lowry and DeRozan. But that was during the regular season. In the playoffs, teams with better defenses knew how to clog up the gears, take away Lowry\u2019s driving lanes and make DeRozan inefficient. Lowry\u2019s scoring nosedived in the postseason, from 21.2 points per game in the 2015-16 regular season to 19.1 in that year\u2019s playoffs, and from 22.4 last regular season to 15.8 in the playoffs. And DeRozan hasn\u2019t shot better than 43 percent in any of his last four playoff runs. The results were unsatisfactory: a Game 7 first-round playoff loss at home in 2014 to Brooklyn, with Paul Pierce blocking Lowry\u2019s last-second shot, a first-round sweep at the hands of Washington the next year, with Pierce, by then with the Wizards, administering the coup de grace, a run to the conference finals in 2016 that ended with Cleveland pummeling the Raptors on their home floor by 26 in the final game and last year\u2019s second-round sweepage by LeBron and Friends.  This year, though, the Raptors are using the regular season as playoff prep, making it harder for opponents to gameplan against them defensively by spreading the wealth around, with much of the largesse occurring behind the 3-point line. Entering play Monday, Toronto was averaging 31.5 3-point attempts, sixth-highest in the league, after averaging 24.3 threes a year ago, 22nd-highest. And even though they shot a higher percentage on threes last year, (their .354 percentage this year is only 22nd-best in the league), that doesn\u2019t matter. Ball movement matters. As a result, Toronto\u2019s moved up this year in Offensive Rating, to 110.6, per NBA.com\/Stats, fourth in the league behind Golden State, Houston and Cleveland. And the Raptors have gone from 10th in the league last year in points per game (106.9) to fourth so far this year (111.3). Lowry\u2019s Usage Rate has dropped from 26.1 two years ago to 21.3. DeRozan\u2019s is down from 34.3 last season to 30.1 so far this season. By contrast, Valanciunas\u2019s rate has risen from 19.5 last season to 21 this season. And when the young guys are on the floor with the veterans, they\u2019re firing away from deep. Lowry was a hard sell when Casey and Ujiri came to him over the summer with the new plan \u2014 \u201cI said, \u2018let me see it first,\u2019\u201d Lowry said. But he and DeRozan are on board now. With its newfound firepower, Toronto has rallied from 17 or more down on the road three times already this season, including Thursday, when the Raptors came back from 22 down in the third. \u201cThe 3-point game is helping us evolve, it\u2019s spacing us out a lot more,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI think it helps with everything \u2014 it helps us with spacing, pace, understanding where we all want to be on the floor. And it gives us the confidence to all do it. We all can shoot it without nobody bitching at you. No one cares who shoots the three. We want everybody to be successful.\u201d DeRozan and Lowry now know that they can bend the defense to them and get wide-open shots for guys that may not be used to taking big shots in big moments. \u201cIt took us a while to get out of habits that were successful for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still won 50-plus games with the way we was playing. But once we bought in, and understood how we could be better at it, you started to see the effects of it during the season. It took us a little while. Even preseason, we wasn\u2019t there. First couple of games, we were still trying to figure it out. Now, you see it. We\u2019re finding our rhythm. Guys understand where to be, how to move the ball, everything.\u201d The offensive improvement has not cost Toronto anything at the other end, either; the Raps continue to be a stout defensive unit under Casey, with a Defensive Rating at 101.8 entering play Monday, sixth-best in the Association. Toronto\u2019s Net Rating of 8.8 trails only the Warriors (11.6) and Houston (10.0). That is despite having just one player in the Top 50 of ESPN.com\u2019s Defensive Real Plus-Minus. The Raptors have had too much playoff heartbreak, though, to believe they\u2019ve arrived. \u201cThis is the NBA,\u201d Ujiri said last week. \u201cWhen it\u2019s going good, you look back, \u2018cause something is coming. And when it\u2019s going bad, our job is to manage. Our job is to figure it out.\u201d That was Ujiri\u2019s and Casey\u2019s joint task after another playoff flameout. It was not easy to look at change, considering how successful the Raptors have been in recent years: four years averaging 51 regular season victories, along with a conference finals appearance in 2016, represented the most successful patch in franchise history. The Raps have an incredible fan base (after Saturday\u2019s win at Air Canada Centre over Philly, Toronto has the best home mark in the league, at 12-1), sell out their building regularly and are the only NBA outlet for an entire nation. It would have been easy to stay comfortable.  But Casey\u2019s experiences in Dallas, with Mark Cuban and Rick Carlisle, helped shape his view that a good team still had room to grow and improve. And Ujiri, as evidenced by his occasional outbursts during postseasons, is much more competitive and tightly wound than he comes across. They knew that after giving Lowry a three-year, $100 million extension in July, and re-signing Serge Ibaka for three years and $65 million, there wasn\u2019t going to be much money left to dive into free agency. Ujiri avoided luxury tax land by dumping DeMarre Carroll (along with a 2018 first-rounder) to Brooklyn, then moved Cory Joseph to Indiana in a sign-and-trade that brought veteran C.J. Miles to the Raptors for three years and $25 million. But that was pretty much it for player acquisition. For the rest, Toronto needed, and needs, to continue developing its young group of players, most taken in the last four Drafts: center Jakob Poeltl (ninth pick overall, 2016) Siakam (27th overall, 2016), forward Bruno Caboclo (20th overall, 2014), guard Delon Wright (20th overall, 2015), and Anunoby, the 23rd pick last June. Only wing Norman Powell, acquired from Milwaukee in 2015 along with the pick that became Anunoby, in exchange for Greivis Vasquez \u2014 a deal looking like a fairly big win for Toronto \u2014 center Bebe Nogueira (acquired in 2014 from Atlanta) and guard Fred VanVleet, an undrafted free agent signed in 2016, have come from outside of the Raptors\u2019 organization. That\u2019s meant arm-in-arm work with Raptors 905, the team\u2019s G League affiliate based in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, which won the G League championship last year under general manager Dan Tolzman and Jerry Stackhouse, the two-time NBA All-Star who was named G League Coach of the Year last season in his first year as a head coach.  Like almost all of the NBA\/G League associations nowadays, Raptors 905 uses the same terminology as the parent club, and teaches the players in the same way as Casey and his coaches do, streamlining the development process further. \u201cThe great thing about 905 is that our guys that went down there, they were with us most of the year, then they went down there at the end and played in the playoffs,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIt really helped them \u2026 our young players play for us. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re at the 905 all year. It\u2019s a good situation where they can go down. It\u2019s a situation now where they have to agree to go down (as part of the new two-way contracts in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement). We can\u2019t make them go down. Bruno\u2019s down there because he wants to be there.\u201d Nogueira, Caboclo, Siakam, Powell, VanVleet and Wright have all spent extensive time going back and forth between Toronto and 905 the last two years. And all of them have subsequently gotten significant playing time with the Raptors in the last year. Powell started the first 12 games before going back to the bench, where most of the others comprise Toronto\u2019s reserve unit. They have to play. \u201cHow do you develop the other guys around these guys?,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThis is going to be the question.\u201d Anunoby is a big piece of that future. (The Raptors also have high hopes for Poeltl, who has a good feel for the game and where to be; he\u2019s currently shooting a crazy 67.1 percent from the floor, producing 7.1 points and 4.5 boards in a little more than 17 minutes a night off the bench.) Anunoby was a projected Lottery pick before tearing his ACL last January, just 16 games into his sophomore season at Indiana. The Raptors targeted Anunoby after the injury, figuring he\u2019d slide some, and maybe to them. Once their Director of Sports Science, Alex McKechnie \u2014 legendary around the NBA for his Core-X training system, which he developed and used with the Lakers for a decade, along with pro hockey, volleyball and soccer players around the world \u2014 thought Anunoby would fully recover from the ACL tear, he planned a rehab program for him before the Draft that would have him ready for training camp. \u201cMasai gives me complete autonomy to do it,\u201d McKechnie said. \u201cI think therein lies the secret of good management. Obviously we\u2019re going to go back and make sure we\u2019re all together, but we say \u2018this is what we\u2019re doing, this the target, this is what we\u2019ll do.\u201d After the Summer League in Vegas, in July, Anunoby went to Vancouver, to work with McKechnie in Vancouver. \u201cHe had a total buy-in,\u201d McKechnie said. \u201cIt was all due to him.\u201d They worked six days a week, starting at 8:30 after breakfast: manual therapy and strengthening programs, work on an underwater treadmill, which included conditioning sprints and side to side movements, weight training, constant strengthening and movement patterns, utilizing Core-X, plyometrics. They\u2019d break for lunch at noon, and then spend a couple of hours on the court in the afternoon, with the work schedule based on what they\u2019d accomplished in the morning. Anunoby\u2019s only time away from McKechnie was when he went to the Rookie Transition Program in August. \u201cJust worked as hard as I can every day,\u201d Anunoby said, \u201cworked on everything \u2014 strengthened my body, and I was also in the gym. A lot of underwater, and a lot of on-court, agility stuff. I wasn\u2019t thinking about (being ready for opening night); I was just trying to get better.\u201d  Anunoby has not been shy about hoisting \u2014 \u201cwe call him \u2018Baby Ray,\u2019\u201d Lowry said, as in Allen. The rookie is shooting 46 percent behind the arc, a recurring bonus that makes his on-ball defense, a strength in college and very promising so far in the pros, all the more impactful. \u201cMy first preseason game, I was hesitating on some shots,\u201d Anunoby said. \u201cAnd they said \u2018shoot.\u2019 Coach told me to shoot; stop pump-faking on shots and just shoot the ball \u2026 it lets me just play. You can just play. Stop thinking about the game and just go out there and having fun. Having their confidence is real nice.\u201d Even Valanciunas is getting in on the act. The Raptors have small-ball lineups with Ibaka at the five that they like, but the numbers point to their best lineups still being with Valanciunas in the middle. Except, he\u2019s not in the middle as much any more. Like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez and other former low-posters, the 25-year-old Valanciunas is, slowly, incorporating the three into his game. Valanciunas took four threes, total, in his first five seasons in Toronto. This season, he\u2019s already taken 11. \u201cI know, from my perspective, on defense, when you have a shooting big, it\u2019s hard to get back when you\u2019re playing pick and roll,\u201d Valanciunas said. \u201cSo I\u2019m using that as an advantage.\u201d But, none of this matters now, and Toronto knows it. After completing a back-to-back sweep of the 76ers Saturday, Toronto is 10-1 in December. But the Raptors have had strong Decembers before. The test will come in April and May. Can Lowry and DeRozan keep the ball moving, or revert to their old, familiar ways? And can the young guys make shots under duress against better, more consistent defenses? Will they stick with it when things get tight? It\u2019s imperative for their hopes of a breakthrough that they try. \u201cYears ago, we (the Spurs) coached Robert Horry,\u201d Sixers Coach Brett Brown said. \u201cAnd if you really studied his percentages, it wasn\u2019t like he was knock-down. But he had the reputation of being a shooter. That, all by itself, gave Tony (Parker) driving lanes, and gave Timmy (Duncan) space. And so I still think, even if you don\u2019t have Steph Curry and (Kevin) Durant, I still think you have to shoot \u2018em, and you have to space the court accordingly.\u201d The Raptors say their culture shift is permanent. The calendar will tell the truth. \u201cWe can always go pick and roll,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWe always can go post-up. We always can go back to that. But let\u2019s try some different things. Let\u2019s do something different. We\u2019re still going to DeMar DeRozan\u2019s stuff. We\u2019re still going to pick and roll Kyle Lowry. But now we have this.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The last time Kobe Bryant held court in Staples Center, he scored 60 points in his last game. The Utah Jazz were the hapless foil; it wasn\u2019t Utah\u2019s fault, but absolutely no one cared who Bryant and the Lakers played on that final night of the 2015-16 season. It was all about Kobe, and his last moment in Forum Blue and Gold. Last Monday was different. Yes, everyone came out to see Bryant\u2019s jerseys get retired, but they also came to see the defending champion Warriors, even without Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Golden State still sported Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, who\u2019s playing some of the best basketball of his career. Through 33 games, Thompson is shooting a career-high .486 from the floor and a career-high .446 from 3-point range , stepping in for his injured Splash Brother to help keep the Warriors\u2019 offense humming. Golden State\u2019s 11-game win streak ended Saturday night at home to the Nuggets, and the Rockets have had the best record in the West all season. But the Warriors are still the team to beat, even though Houston has made no secret of the fact that Golden State is its white whale and obsession. (The Warriors don\u2019t return the favor. As Steve Kerr put it to the San Francisco Chronicle: \u201cI don\u2019t wake up in the morning thinking about them. I think about what I\u2019m going to have for breakfast. I also think about lunch, what we\u2019re going to do at practice and what movie my wife and I are going to watch that night.\u201d) That\u2019s right up Thompson\u2019s alley; the next time the 27-year-old shows outward emotion on the floor about anything that doesn\u2019t involve the game will be the first. But it meant something to Thompson to be in L.A. the night one of his idols growing up got a final sendoff. Embracing the Lakers, after all, has been a family tradition for a while . * * * Me: Joel Embiid told me that Kobe was a real inspiration for him growing up to be a basketball player. You obviously came from a different place in terms of growing up with the NBA game, but what were your memories of watching him as a kid?  Klay Thompson: I was just fortunate to watch him, obviously go from the transformation from number 8 to 24, win championships, scoring titles, put on historic performances, and his game winners. He missed a lot of game winners, but that\u2019s what made him who he was. He was never afraid to take the shot. He always wanted it. He made some of those incredible shots look easy. Such an incredible athlete. The way he could contort his body, too. People forget, he was such a great player, he came into the league a better athlete than he was a player. He honed his skills. You\u2019ve got to respect somebody who maximized his potential, and Kobe did that. Me: You played against him a few times. What was that like? KT: It was always one of my favorite games, because he was the guy I watched the most growing up. So to always play against him was a huge moment for me. And he faced that every night. That\u2019s why he was such a great player. Like the guys like Michael Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, Larry Bird, they faced the opponent\u2019s best game every night. He showed up every night, and always embraced the challenge and the competition. So it\u2019s just some of my favorite moments as a player. I\u2019m going to get to tell my kids one day that I got to compete against Kobe. Me: Y\u2019all are still stopping people, even with Steph and Draymond out recently. How have you maintained that defensive focus with such key guys out? KT: Our depth is amazing, and we\u2019ve got guys who love to compete. You have to have a defense of just effort. And we\u2019ve got guys who go out who are hungry to show the world that they\u2019re good players, who might not get the minutes when we\u2019re fully healthy. Everyone\u2019s stepping up. Obviously KD is special \u2014 his scoring performances and near triple doubles are special. But just \u2018cause our best defensive player isn\u2019t out there, and a few starters, it\u2019s not a huge dropoff for us.

Is it good for you all to have somebody else get a lot of attention for a change? KT: I mean, yeah, we don\u2019t really pay too much attention to the media, because it can build you up and brings you down. So you just kind of, you can pay attention to it, but not read too much into it. Houston\u2019s playing phenomenal right now\u2026they\u2019ve had a crazy win streak. They\u2019re really gelling. Unfortunately, we lost our first game to them, but I think we\u2019ve got an immensely better sense now. We\u2019ll see them soon, so that\u2019s going to remain a challenge for us, because they\u2019re playing so well. We don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re getting the attention. We just want to get wins and just stay healthy. Me: So where would you say you are as a team in terms of building toward May and June? KT: I feel like we\u2019re playing great. We had a great road trip. I mean, you think about it, an eight-, nine-, 10-game winning streak, something like that. Our defense has been tremendous these last (few) games. We\u2019re not there yet; we\u2019ve still got a long ways to go. But for December, and the level we\u2019re playing at, I think we\u2019re playing real well, considering we didn\u2019t start off the season too well. \u2014 Former NBA player Charlie Villanueva ( @CVBelieve ), Wednesday, 7:16 a.m., still incredulous that someone broke into his Dallas home last Tuesday and stole several items\u2026 including his toilet .

Christmas 2017 sees an NBA that hasn\u2019t had as good a year as the past 12 months in a long time. While the NFL suffered from a series of week to week crises \u2014 many, though not all, self-inflicted \u2014 and while the country was roiled by seemingly endless strife, pro basketball kept rolling sevens, for which the league and its players earned most, though not all, of the credit. It has been a long time since the NBA knew such good fortune. A long time. The recent history of the league was highlighted much more by what was going wrong than going right. But last year, the focus was on the floor, with the NBA and the Players\u2019 Association quickly coming to agreement on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement at the end of 2016. Russell Westbrook and James Harden put on an historic MVP race. And as in the early 90s with Michael Jordan, the league\u2019s best player, LeBron James, was, seemingly, even better in his early 30s than ever \u2014 and basically impregnable off of it. Even Donald Trump, who never has met a foe he doesn\u2019t try to crush on Twitter, stayed silent in September after James called him a \u201cbum\u201d online for criticizing the Warriors\u2019 decision not to go to the White House. Franchises long dormant in some of the NBA\u2019s biggest cities \u2014 the Knicks, the 76ers, the Lakers \u2014 showed signs of revival in 2017. New York retooled around Kristaps Porzingis after firing Phil Jackson as team president and trading former face of the franchise Carmelo Anthony. Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have historic potential in Philadelphia at their respective positions. And the Lakers\u2019 impact rookie hasn\u2019t been second overall pick and super-hyped Lonzo Ball, but unheralded Kyle Kuzma from Utah. (Today marks the first time since 2001 that all three teams are playing on Christmas Day.) The Warriors remain the gold standard, full of telegenic superstars. They have changed the pro game forever: hunting 3s and layups, stretching defenses to the breaking point, creating driving lanes through which you could drive trucks, switching on everything on defense. They make it look so easy, everyone thinks they can duplicate it. To this point, no one else has done so over a full season and playoffs. The Warriors and Cavaliers have made early June appointment TV the last three years, providing real drama for the highest stakes. Both teams play the game the right way, moving the ball, and getting great performances from their marquee players. So many people say it\u2019s boring to know who\u2019ll be in the Finals; the ratings say otherwise. So, today, as the Dubs and Cavs highlight another Christmas schedule on ESPN, ABC and TNT , Merry Christmas to all the players, coaches, broadcasters, writers, support staff and anyone else who has to be away from their homes to provide us with the day-long slate of marquee games. Most of all, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all of you, who read this column every week, and who support it \u2014 whether you agree or disagree with anything in it. I don\u2019t expect anyone to agree with me all the time, and that would be boring, wouldn\u2019t it? It takes a long time to write 8,000-10,000 words every week, 48 weeks a year, but I continue to hope that it\u2019s worth it, that this is a comprehensive look at the week that was in the NBA, and a preview of what\u2019s to come. Anyone who loves the orange leather has a seat at our table; basketball is a community and culture, one that we all share. And Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, as well, to: And blessings to Fatty Taylor, Steve (Snapper) Jones , Jess Kersey , Justin Reed, Connie Hawkins , Chyna Thomas , Jerry Krause , Kenny Sears, Fab Melo , Frank Deford, John Andariese , Tommy Hawkins , Frank Hamblen , Darall Imhoff , Dick Enberg , John Kundla , Dave Stallworth , Jack McCloskey , Charles Shackleford and Gene Conley .

They\u2019ve contested the last three NBA Finals and are unquestionably the rock-star teams in the league, chock full of stars, who are once again the favorites to capture their conference titles and go for four in a row. Six months ago the Warriors won the championship rubber match and of course that didn\u2019t sit well with LeBron James. He had a chance to reflect on that series, which was basically decided by Kevin Durant, the best player on the floor for the majority of those games. Durant hit a 3-pointer in the final moments of Game 3 that swung the series solidly in Golden State\u2019s favor and the rest was history. Joe Vardon of the Plain Dealer caught up with James about that shot and that series and LeBron was pretty frank: The Christmas Day meeting, the third straight between these teams by the way, will be missing a key figure in Stephen Curry , and of course there\u2019s nothing major at stake besides early season bragging rights. Still, the Cavs are surging in the East after some November stumbles and could be leading the conference before 2018 kicks in. Meanwhile, the Warriors are using this time without Curry to sample different lineups and try not to wear out Durant. Until a few other teams prove otherwise, namely the Celtics and Raptors and Spurs and especially the Rockets, this Warriors-Cavs grudge match appears on course to happen again next June. By then, maybe the Cavs will figure out a way to keep Durant in check. Maybe that should be their main goal on Christmas, besides winning the game. Never too early to send a message."},{"id":42631,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-still-room-improvement","date":"2017-12-25","title":"Although making improvements, Philadelphia 76ers remain in 'Process' mode","content":" * On ESPN: Sixers vs. Knicks (12 ET) Wasn\u2019t it just yesterday when the Sixers were scalding hot and the darlings of the league, led by the irresistible Joel Embiid? Their somewhat surprising rise in the East made folks in Philly and other places look forward to seeing them on Christmas Day against the Knicks. But the Sixers have hit a wall and Embiid has spent time on the bench with nagging injuries and suddenly \u2026 well, put it this way: The Knicks have a better record. Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer put it like this after speaking with coach Brett Brown: Well, the message for those feeling shaky about the Sixers is this: Relax. Inconsistency is a common symptom for teams that are still in the rebuilding process and loaded with young players in the rotation. Even if the Sixers don\u2019t make the playoffs, they\u2019re still blessed with Embiid and Ben Simmons, two players whose DNA suggests they\u2019ll soon be franchise bedrocks, if they aren\u2019t already. The key for rest of the regular season is less about making the playoffs (big deal) and more about seeing what they have in Markelle Fultz once he returns from his shoulder injury. During the \u201cTrust The Process\u201d phase, Philly already blew it with two relatively high picks in Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor. They\u2019d rather not miss with a third, especially since he was not only the No. 1 overall pick, but the Sixers surrendered a future first-rounder just to trade up and draft him. So the \u201cprocess\u201d is not centered around Embiid anymore or even Simmons. It\u2019s about Fultz and if he can salvage his rookie season with a reasonably strong finish. If the Sixers can emerge from this season with four positions set \u2014 Embiid at center, Simmons at forward, Fultz at point guard and Robert Covington at forward \u2014 that will allow them lots of flexibility going forward and plenty of options. As for Christmas Day against the Knicks? It\u2019s a good opening act for the holiday. But no more than that."},{"id":42638,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kris-dunn-finding-groove-chicago-bulls","date":"2017-12-25","title":"Kris Dunn beginning to look more like Chicago Bulls' point guard of future","content":" It\u2019s a bit too early to say the Bulls got the better of the deal last summer that sent Jimmy Butler to the Wolves. The main player who came in return, Zach LaVine, is still weeks away from returning from injury. But it\u2019s looking better with Kris Dunn showing signs of having the breakout season than many expected after the Wolves drafted him two years ago. Dunn\u2019s arrival in Chicago was initially shaky, yet he\u2019s firmly in place as the team\u2019s point guard and looking and feeling as though he belongs. That comfort zone is helping Bulls fans breathe easier, knowing that Dunn has become a big part of a young core that should expedite the Bulls\u2019 rebuilding process. KC Johnson of the Chicago Tribune offers this about Dunn: Look at the Bulls right now: Dunn, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Lauri Markkanen and Justin Holiday are all twentysomethings who are nowhere near their peak yet surging and showing potential. From a developing standpoint, the Bulls are far better off than they were last year with Butler, Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade as the showpieces. Of course, the next task is seeing what they have in LaVine. From all indications, he has looked solid in light workouts and showing no affects of his knee injury from last year. LaVine had star potential before that injury and the Bulls are confident he can play above the rim once again. The salary cap situation is good with no dead weight and the Bulls should add another young player from a favorable position in next summer\u2019s draft. Plus, they might decide to trade Mirotic before the deadline. They\u2019re going in the right direction. Now it\u2019s about making enough right decisions that some day puts them back on the Christmas Day schedule once again."},{"id":42637,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bismack-biyombo-orlando-magic-holidays-siblings","date":"2017-12-25","title":"Orlando Magic's Bismack Biyombo spends holiday with siblings for first time in years","content":" One of the true good guys in the league is Bismack Biyombo, the swatting center for the Magic. Approachable, polite and professional, Biyombo has been a locker room favorite in Charlotte, Toronto and now Orlando, and it\u2019s easy to see why. He came to this country without anything, growing up poor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The money he makes from one game could support a family back in his homeland for a year. The Magic don\u2019t play on Christmas but it\u2019ll be a big moment for Biyombo anyway. For the first time since he left home, he\u2019ll spend the holiday with all six of his siblings \u2014 three brothers and three sisters. Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel spent time with the family and wrote this: As the NBA expanded its borders well beyond the States, plenty of players arrived, acclimated well and made a generous living for themselves. But there\u2019s always a story behind the story, of how they left family behind to pursue their dreams, of how they\u2019ve tried to maintain a sense of culture and connection despite being an ocean (or two) away. And very often, like Biyombo, they\u2019ve taken the role of provider for the education of their siblings and also helping them migrate to America to find a better way as well. So here\u2019s to the Biyombo family, wishing them well on the biggest holiday of the year in the U.S., and hoping they, too, will find the same success as their very tall brother.

Kevin Durant has been dominant during the Curry-less stretch, averaging 32.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 6.6 assists and 3.0 blocks per contest over the last seven games.

That\u2019s a much bigger difference than there is with the league as a whole (about 54 percent vs. 43 percent). His catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts have been worth 1.15 points per shot. His pull-up 2-point jumpers have been worth 0.66. So having him shoot more off the catch would certainly help the Thunder, who have had two of their more efficient offensive games of the season this week . But it will take a lot of work to get Anthony to change his shot chart. He has still taken 45 percent of his shots from mid-range (between the paint and the 3-point line) this season. That\u2019s the third highest rate among 167 players who have taken 200 total shots, behind only those of Dirk Nowitzki and Evan Turner. Only LaMarcus Aldridge has attempted more total mid-range shots than Anthony. And Anthony\u2019s decrease in efficiency ( his true shooting percentage is a career-low 50 percent ) is about more than just mid-range shots vs. threes. He\u2019s actually taken a higher percentage of his shots from 3-point range (36 percent) than he ever has, but he has seen a greater reduction in shots from the paint than from mid-range. Of his 473 shots, only 55 (12 percent) have come in the restricted area. That career-low rate goes along with a career-low free throw rate (22 attempts per 100 shots from the field).

The ability to set effective screens, both on and off the ball, is an underappreciated skill, one that doesn\u2019t show up in the standard boxscore, and can have a huge effect on a game. But for the last two seasons, the league has tracked \u201cscreen assists,\u201d defined as screens \u201cfor a teammate that directly lead to a made field goal by that teammate,\u201d as part of its hustle stats . And the league leader, both last season and this season (through Thursday\u2019s games), has been Marcin Gortat of the Washington Wizards, who has averaged 5.9 screen assists per game over the year-plus. Volume is key. Nobody sets more screens the Gortat. Nobody plays more games than Gortat, either. He has missed just eight games in his five seasons in Washington. And he\u2019s always been willing to do the dirty work. \u201cHe\u2019s a willing screener, he wants to screen, and he\u2019s willing to get hit,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said about Gortat last month. \u201cA lot of players want to slip every screen, because it hurts.\u201d John Wall and Bradley Beal are the Wizards\u2019 stars, and Gortat has often been mentioned as a player the Wizards could trade in an attempt to raise their ceiling. But the ability of Wall and Beal to get open and get to the basket would be compromised without the screens of Gortat. \u201cHe gets our offense going,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best in the league and he\u2019s going to be that way for a long time, because he wants to do it and he enjoys getting guys open. We just have to find him a few more times when he does roll, because he does like to score around the basket also.\u201d Gortat agrees with his coach. But Gortat\u2019s screening ability goes beyond standard pick-and-rolls, though. He\u2019s also one of the league\u2019s best at ad-lib screening, where, as a play develops (often in transition) he finds an opportunity to get in the way of a defender and create a path to the basket for his teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart screener,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cHe knows angles. There\u2019s a lot of times he screens his own man, because John and Brad, they have enough speed. If their man is looking for the screen, they\u2019re gone. And he knows that and sees that, so he screens his own man.\u201d Gortat sat down with NBA.com last week to talk about the art of screening, his chemistry with John Wall, and the frustration of not being rewarded (or even acknowledged) for setting a good screen. NBA.com: Is the screen assist stat something you pay attention to? Marcin Gortat: \u201cYeah, at end of the day, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m focusing on it. It\u2019s just part of my game. I\u2019m just doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve always been known for being a great pick-and-roll player and additionally now, it\u2019s guys making shots coming out of my screens. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my curse, because there\u2019s a saying \u2018Set a good screen and you\u2019ll be open.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m setting good screens, but the other guy\u2019s open. And most of the time, when I set a good screen, the guys are shooting. So there\u2019s not to many dump-offs and passing toward me. So it\u2019s kind of like my curse right now. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m happy and there are days that I\u2019m really frustrated with that, because obviously I\u2019m helping my teammates to get open, but at the same time, I\u2019m not even involved in the game.\u201d NBA.com: So you could set three or four screens on a single possession and never touch the ball. Gortat: \u201cExactly. Well, most of the time, when I set three or four screens, on the third or fourth screen, there\u2019s going to be an open bucket. I take pride in doing it, but like I said, it\u2019s my curse.\u201d NBA.com: When did you develop this skill? Gortat: \u201cIt started from being a physical guy who\u2019s not afraid of the contact, not afraid of getting dirty. Obviously, [there\u2019s] some basketball IQ, knowing the angle of the screen, knowing the timing of the screen. And obviously, sometimes you gotta set the screen a little bit illegally. It is what it is. \u201cAt the same time, I learned setting screens from a lot of different players, mainly Kendrick Perkins back in the day, KG, Dennis Rodman. I watched them setting screens.\u201d NBA.com: So you watched film on setting screens? Gortat: \u201cI watched film and I read articles about it. I\u2019ve always had a great mentor, Brendan Malone. He\u2019s like my father. He taught me a lot in Orlando. After every practice, he would come down and give me an article to read or he would call me up to the office to watch film on a day off. \u201cAnd I would be like, \u2018What the hell are we watching on a day off?\u2019 And he would show me some things like what could I do in the future. So I learned and it definitely helped me to become a better player.\u201d NBA.com: You and John Wall have great pick-and-roll chemistry. How did that come about? Gortat: \u201cThat\u2019s been 400 games. We\u2019ve played together for five years. So there has to be some kind of chemistry. And I truly believe there is great chemistry. I don\u2019t need to communicate with John. Our body language is just outstanding. He knows I\u2019m reading the big, I\u2019m seeing how they\u2019re playing him on the pick-and-roll, and I\u2019m just making a counter-move.\u201d NBA.com: So when Tim Frazier comes in this year, how long does it take to develop pick-and-roll chemistry? Gortat: \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not going to be that easy for the other point guards. To be effective with me on screens, you need to be jet quick. That\u2019s one. \u201cTwo, you need to have that ability to get to the basket with a variety of moves, to be able to finish with the left and right hand. John can do that. There\u2019s not too many point guards in the league that can do that. \u201cWith Tim, we play a few pick-and-rolls, but we\u2019ve played 20 games together, and in those 20 games, it\u2019s probably 10 minutes a game. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve had a chance to play with him for five years. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201d NBA.com: It seems like you\u2019re always looking for an opportunity to screen, even in transition, where you may be a step or two ahead of the ball-handler. Gortat: \u201cAlways. One thing I\u2019ve developed is rim running and trying to seal the guy early in a post-up. And most of the time, because they don\u2019t want me catching the ball deep in the paint, they\u2019re fronting me, which automatically puts me in a situation to [set] a screen. And obviously, [with Wall\u2019s] speed in the open court, there\u2019s nobody in the league that can contain that, so he\u2019s usually using me as a brush screener. \u201cAnd the scary part is that I\u2019m getting a lot of offensive fouls for that, because I\u2019m screening my man, who is standing in front of me, and John is coming full speed and the point guard and big man are crashing against each other very hard. It looks dangerous and people say I pushed. No, that\u2019s just the speed that John has and that\u2019s what he does to the players. I was just standing, holding my guy, and they just ran into each other, which is nobody\u2019s fault. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201d NBA.com: Most important question\u2026 If somebody passes you the ball and you score, you point and acknowledge the pass\u2026 Gortat: \u201cYeah, most of the time, I\u2019m trying to do that.\u201d NBA.com: Now, when you set a great screen that sets a teammate up for a wide-open shot, does anybody acknowledge it? Gortat: \u201cMaybe the bench players, a few of them. But not the guys in the game.\u201d NBA.com: Coach Brooks told me that he\u2019ll acknowledge it in the film room, and he wants everybody to see it and appreciate it. But it\u2019s never happened on the floor? No \u201cgood screen, Marc\u201d from a the guy you just freed for an open shot? Gortat: \u201cOccasionally. But not with the frequency that I\u2019m setting screens.\u201d NBA.com: And not with the frequency that someone would acknowledge a passing assist. A few times a year, then? Gortat: \u201cMaybe once a week.\u201d NBA.com: Once a week? That\u2019s not bad. I imagine it can be tough when you\u2019ve already set a couple of screens on a possession, you\u2019ve rolled to the basket and, with six or seven seconds left on the shot clock, one of the guards is calling for another screen. Gortat: \u201cSometimes.\u201d NBA.com: But being a good screener is about being a willing screener, primarily, right? Gortat: \u201cIt\u2019s about being in the right shape to go up and down with John and Brad, set a screen, roll down and come back up. It takes a lot of energy. It\u2019s a [pain] to do that. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m able to survive in this league \u2026 obviously I don\u2019t shoot threes \u2026 but I do a lot of things on the court that a lot of people appreciate. And they feel comfortable playing with me, because first, I can keep up with people. And two, I set good screens and make sure the angles are right for the guards to attack the basket.\u201d John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Battles between future superstars ( Philadelphia at New York ), the renewal of a championship rivalry that continues to simmer from both sides ( Cleveland at Golden State ), another chapter in a bubbling blood feud between Eastern Conference contenders ( Washington at Boston ), a reacquaintance of friends turned into rivals ( Houston at Oklahoma City ) and a nightcap between teams hungry to step out of the shadows and into the playoff spotlight in the Western Conference for years to come ( Minnesota at Los Angeles Lakers ). The holiday showcase also offers the perfect platform for superstars ready to bolster their cases for inclusion in the Kia MVP conversation, a celebration of MVP types of the recent past, the present and most likely the future. Four of the top five players in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder \u2014 No. 1 James Harden, No. 2 LeBron James, No. 3 Kevin Durant and No. 4 Kyrie Irving \u2014 will have the chance to state their cases, LeBron and KD in a head-to-head matchup that should be a continuation of their duel from The Finals. And Harden will have a chance to make his bones against the reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook, who comes in at No. 10 this week on the Ladder with the Thunder still trying to sort through the transition of adding Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to their mix. There are subplots galore, perhaps none more intriguing than the Warriors-related ones LeBron and Harden will bring to the party. The Cavaliers are playing inspired this season led by LeBron, no doubt a direct reflection of an offseason that saw Irving demand a trade and bolt for Boston in the aftermath of another Finals defeat at the hands of the Warriors. He\u2019s as good as he\u2019s ever been, by his own measure, 15 seasons into his NBA career and just days away from his 33rd birthday. If nothing else, Monday\u2019s game is another opportunity to remind everyone that he\u2019s still the single most dominant force in the game. \u201cThere comes a point when the mental meets the physical, and physically, LeBron seems to be at the point where he still hasn\u2019t maxed out,\u201d said NBA TV and TNT analyst Greg Anthony. \u201cThat is what\u2019s kind of crazy for me \u2026 he\u2019s as quick as I\u2019ve ever seen him and as athletic.\u201d It\u2019s a remarkable run, this late in a career that has spanned multiple eras. \u201cNo player in any sport has had the pressure of their sport, nor the money before they stepped on the court,\u201d said NBA TV and TNT\u2019s Chris Webber. \u201cI remember everyone was saying that there\u2019s no way he can fulfill that potential. He\u2019s probably surpassed most people\u2019s expectations\u2026 Just incredible.\u201d That\u2019s a perfect word to describe what Harden and the Rocket have done this season, the first with Harden and Chris Paul joining forces to mount their own challenge to the Warriors. The best record in the league , including a season-opening win over the Warriors, has done nothing but fuel the Rockets\u2019 obsession \u2014 Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s word \u2014 with the crew in Oakland. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing we think about,\u201d Morey told ESPN Radio\u2019s The Ryen Russillo Show on Thursday . \u201cI think I\u2019m not supposed to say that, but we\u2019re basically obsessed with \u2018How do we beat the Warriors?\u2019 \u201cLast year the Spurs knocked us off, so we\u2019re very worried about the Spurs, they\u2019re always one step ahead of every organization and guard us better than anyone. But we calculated it \u2014 it\u2019s like 90 percent if we\u2019re gonna win a title, we\u2019ve gotta obviously beat the Warriors at some point. So we\u2019re extremely focused on that. A lot of our signings and what we do during the year is based on that.\u201d Harden has dominated the competition from the opening tip at Oracle in October, shining with Paul playing at an elite level when healthy and when Paul missed 14 games with a bruised knee. He\u2019s leading the league in scoring , directs the most efficient offense in basketball and has his focus locked in on the bigger goals that come beyond regular season highlights like the Christmas Day matchup against his old team and good friend Westbrook. There will be no let up, not now, not with everything ahead of them. \u201cNever a step back, we don\u2019t look at step backs,\u201d Harden told reporters when asked of the adjustments that have to be made with Paul out again with an adductor injury suffered in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Lakers. \u201cWe just try to get better and continue to push, obviously if Chris is injured of Clint (Capela) misses two games or whatever, we just have to continue to push and continue to find ways to better ourselves individually and as a team.\u201d \u201cNo pressure. No pressure for me, no pressure for our team. Go out there and compete and try to win as many games as we can.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 10 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats:  31.9 points, 9.0 assists, 5.1 rebounds The Rockets\u2019 win streak hit 14 games before the Los Angeles Lakers ended their roll Wednesday night at Toyota Center. Harden\u2019s 51 points (15-for-27 from the floor, 4-for-6 from deep and 17-for-21 from the free throw line) wasn\u2019t enough to slow down the young Lakers or offset the loss of Chris Paul (adductor), who will not be in uniform for tonight\u2019s visit by the Los Angeles Clippers ( 8 ET, ESPN ). The Rockets\u2019 focus, however, doesn\u2019t change. Harden has to continue grinding away, with or without Paul in the lineup, if the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference playoff chase is as important to him as it appears it is. And if we\u2019ve learned anything about Harden over the years, it\u2019s that he has no problem doing the solo superstar thing for long stretches (Paul could be out through Christmas). Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  28.2 points, 9.3 assists, 8.3 rebounds LeBron and the Cavaliers played early Scrooge on the Chicago Bulls Thursday night , snapping the spirits (and the seven-game win streak) of Fred Holberg\u2019s crew at Quicken Loans Arena. LeBron\u2019s 34 points (12-for-23 from the floor, 2-for-5 from beyond the 3-point line and a perfect 8-for-8 from the free throw line), six rebounds, nine assists and three steals served as punctuation that there will be no nights off during this regular season for the four-time Kia MVP. Not with his 33rd birthday just days away and LeBron on a season-long mission to capture his fifth MVP trophy (he doesn\u2019t have to admit to it, but it\u2019s obvious that he has attacked this season differently than he has recent seasons). He and the Cavaliers will enjoy a nice long weekend before Monday\u2019s Finals rematch\/showdown with the Golden State Warriors on Christmas at Oracle Arena. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  26.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.3 assists It isn\u2019t always pretty, but when the Warriors have needed Durant to step up and carry the load, he\u2019s answered each and every time. Their win-streak sits at a league-leading 10 games heading into tonight\u2019s game at Oracle Arena ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) against those pesky Los Angeles Lakers (they needed overtime to survive Kyle Kuzma and Co. Monday night in Kobeland). Durant has hit the 36-point mark in three of his last five games, scoring punch that has been needed with Stephen Curry out for five straight games and counting through Christmas. Maybe the surge was coming anyway, it is KD after all, but Durant\u2019s scoring through nine games this month (29.4) is a significant jump from what he did in nine games last month (24.6). Durant will have to keep it up, even after Curry returns, if the Warriors are going to chase the Rockets out of that No. 1 spot in the standings. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  24.0 points, 4.9 assists, 3.0 rebounds As high as Irving and the Celtics were riding during their 16-game win streak that ended before Thanksgiving, they need to refrain from stressing out too much now that the reality of this season has bitten them like it has almost every other team in the league. They\u2019ve now lost five of their past nine games, including back-to-back nights against the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks Thursday night on TNT. No amount of heroics from Kyrie, who has scored 30 or more points in six of the eight games he\u2019s played in during that stretch, have saved the Celtics. Injuries and karma have caught up to the Celtics right now, and the schedule is relentless in the coming days \u2014 home games against an improved Chicago (Saturday) and rival Washington (Christmas Day) followed by a road trip to Charlotte (Dec. 27) and home games against Houston (Dec. 28) and Brooklyn (Dec. 31) to finish off 2017. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  29.7 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists Antetekounmpo and the Bucks served notice with Tuesday\u2019s win over LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers that they could be a problem, a legitimate one, for the three-time defending Eastern Conference champs down the road. The win over the Cavaliers also helped the Bucks get back on track after three straight losses. Antetokounmpo\u2019s brilliant season has cranked back up after the Bucks battled through a few rough patches. He worked the Cavaliers for 27 points (on 8-for-14 shooting from the floor and a sterling 11-for-12 from the free throw line), 14 rebounds, eight assists and two steals. And after looking like he wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain his 30-plus point pace of the early season when his scoring average dipped from 33.7 on .632 shooting in October to 26.5 on .496 in October, the Greek Freak is averaging 30.9 points on .540 shooting this month with five more games to play before the calendar flips. The next five: 6. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 7. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers 8. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 9. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 10. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder And five more \u2026: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Chris Paul, Houston Rockets; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves A behind-the-scenes look at Kyle Kuzma from a Western Conference scout: \u201cKuzma needs to be a lesson for all of us, the entire league. Following the herd is how you end up missing on a guy like that. There are far too many guys willing to miss on a consensus guy these days than there are guys willing to pound the table for a guy they believe in but doesn\u2019t fit into the profile. He\u2019s not just the Lakers\u2019 best rookie, sorry Lonzo [Ball], he\u2019s far and away their best player right now. He can shoot it, he\u2019s got plenty of range on his shot, he\u2019s got fantastic size for his position, he\u2019s got all the tools. He makes it look easy out there at times, and he doesn\u2019t force it the way some rookies in his situation might. I know Lonzo is supposed to be the face of the franchise and the future and all of that stuff, and I\u2019m still high on him. I think he plays the right way and will only get better. But Kuzma\u2019s the guy. And I think a lot of us felt that way after [Summer League in Las] Vegas, but people were still hesitant to say it out loud. The league is so homogenous these days. Everybody\u2019s crunching the same data, looking for the exact same things in players and styles and sometimes you just miss on a guy. But as much attention as all of these guys from the Pac-12 got last season, how Kuzma almost slipped through the cracks is beyond me \u2026 and I said almost, because the Lakers didn\u2019t miss on him. They must have known something or seen something the rest of us didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a little like what happened with Jimmy Butler or even Draymond Green in recent years. I think the kid is could wind up being the All-Star from that bunch in a few years, I really do. Sometimes the evaluation process is just off, it doesn\u2019t capture the things you need to project certain guys beyond what you see from them in college.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He was 82. Enberg\u2019s daughter, Nicole Enberg Vaz, confirmed the death to The Associated Press. She said the family became concerned when her father didn\u2019t arrive Thursday on his flight to Boston, and he was found dead at his home in La Jolla, a San Diego neighborhood, with his bags packed. His daughter said the family believes Enberg died of a heart attack but was awaiting official word. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very, very shocking,\u201d said Vaz, who lives in Boston. \u201cHe\u2019d been busy with two podcasts and was full of energy.\u201d Enberg\u2019s wife, Barbara, was already in Boston and was expecting his arrival. The family \u201cis grateful for the kind thoughts and prayers of all of Dick\u2019s countless fans and dear friends,\u201d according to a statement released by Enberg\u2019s attorney, Dennis Coleman. \u201cAt this time we are all still processing the significant loss, and we ask for prayers and respectful privacy in the immediate aftermath of such untimely news.\u201d Enberg got his big break with UCLA basketball and went on to call Super Bowls, Olympics, Final Fours and Angels and Padres baseball games as well as Rams football games. He retired from his TV job with the Padres in October 2016, capping a six-decade career punctuated with countless calls of \u201cOh my!\u201d in describing big plays. He also was well-known for his baseball catchphrase of \u201cTouch \u2019em all!\u201d for home runs. \u201cDick was an institution in the industry for 60 years and we were lucky enough to have his iconic voice behind the microphone for Padres games for nearly a decade,\u201d Padres owners Ron Fowler and Peter Seidler said in a statement. \u201cOn behalf of our entire organization, we send our deepest condolences to his wife, Barbara, and the entire Enberg family.\u201d Raised in Armada, Michigan, Enberg\u2019s first radio job was actually as a radio station custodian in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, when he was a junior at Central Michigan. He made $1 an hour. The owner also gave him weekend sports and disc jockey gigs, also at $1 an hour. From there he began doing high school and college football games. During his nine years broadcasting UCLA basketball, the Bruins won eight NCAA titles. Enberg broadcast nine no-hitters, including two by San Francisco\u2019s Tim Lincecum against the Padres in 2013 and 2014. He said the most historically important event he covered was \u201cThe Game of the Century,\u201d Houston\u2019s victory over UCLA in 1968 that snapped the Bruins\u2019 47-game winning streak. \u201cThat was the platform from which college basketball\u2019s popularity was sent into the stratosphere,\u201d Enberg said just before retiring from the Padres. \u201cThe \u201979 game, the Magic-Bird game, everyone wants to credit that as the greatest game of all time. That was just the booster rocket that sent it even higher. \u2026 UCLA, unbeaten; Houston, unbeaten. And then the thing that had to happen, and Coach Wooden hated when I said this, but UCLA had to lose. That became a monumental event.\u201d Enberg\u2019s many former broadcast partners included Merlin Olsen, Al McGuire, Billy Packer, Don Drysdale and Tony Gwynn. He even worked a few games with Wooden, whom he called \u201cThe greatest man I\u2019ve ever known other than my own father.\u201d Enberg called Padres games for seven seasons and went into the broadcasters\u2019 wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 as the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award. John Ireland, the radio voice of the Los Angeles Lakers, tweeted that \u201cIf there was a Mount Rushmore of LA Sports Announcers, Dick Enberg is on it with Chick Hearn, Vin Scully and Bob Miller. Rams, Angels, UCLA, NBC, and so much more. Was the first famous announcer I ever met, and he couldn\u2019t have been nicer. Definition of a gentleman.\u201d Enberg won 13 Sports Emmy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and UCLA named its Media Center in Pauley Pavilion after Enberg this year. At halftime of a UCLA game in February, former Bruins stars Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes presented Enberg with a No. 8 jersey, signifying the number of championships he called. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again,\u201d Enberg said before the game. \u201cWho was looking over me? To be able to come in and ride the Wooden Wave.\u201d \u201cKindest, most proactive possible treatment of newcomers in this business, for the length of his career,\u201d broadcaster Keith Olbermann said of Enberg on Twitter. \u201cWhat a terrible loss.\u201d The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said flowers will be placed Friday on Enberg\u2019s star on the Walk of Fame."},{"id":48192,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/shaqtin-fool-2017-18-episode-8","date":"2017-12-22","title":"Shaqtin' A Fool 2017-18: Episode 8","content":"Vote now for the Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool play of the week!

Beasley, the No. 2 overall pick in 2008, was viewed as an unstoppable offensive machine, capable of single-handedly torching a defense. Porzingis was considered the all-risk consolation prize from overseas, a 7-foot-3 symbol of bad luck after the Knicks toppled from the second-best odds in the draft to the fourth overall pick in 2015. Opinions changed drastically as their respective careers unfolded. Beasley\u2019s on-court inefficiency and off-court issues combined to wear out his welcome quickly in Miami, Minnesota, Phoenix and Miami again by the time Porzingis entered the league. When he did, it was to the boos of the ever-vocal Knicks fans who were frustrated at losing out on Karl-Anthony Towns and Jahlil Okafor. Fast forward further, and the disparity between expectations and reality is even greater. Porzingis is now fondly referred to as The Unicorn due to his unique and dominant blend of size, speed and skill. He is viewed as the quintessential talent with franchise-player potential. Beasley, meanwhile, signed on with the Knicks during the offseason as a low-cost, low-risk, addition to the depth chart. If he failed to produce, well, his lack of impact would not alter a game\u2019s outcome. One quarter of the way through the season, Porzingis and Beasley stayed true to those roles \u2014 until Thursday night, when they flipped completely against the East-best Boston Celtics. First-time visitors\/viewers left the game thinking two things: that Beasley is a Kia Most Valuable Player candidate and Porzingis is a terrible, terrible basketball player. Neither of those facts are true. It just looked that way for one magically insane night. There was Kristaps Porzingis, the Knicks\u2019 beloved star, missing shot after shot after shot. He made one all night. It was a free throw. The Latvian sensation clanked all 11 of his field goal attempts. The unlikeliness of it all left him joking at his own expense after the game. \u201cKobe [Bryant] says you miss 100 percent of the shots you don\u2019t take,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cToday I missed all hundred.\u201d On the other side of a Knicks world turned upside-down was Beasley, seemingly making \u201call hundred.\u201d The fallen top-two pick flashed the potential that made him dominant in college and frustrating in the pros, scoring 18 of his game-high 32 points in the fourth quarter. Knicks fans, always quick to show appreciation for any quality performance, serenaded him with chants of \u201cM-V-P.\u201d Michael Beasley? MVP? In Madison Square Garden? For one night, yes, and there was no doubt the much-maligned forward loved every second of his shining moment. He was asked after the game when he started feeling the hot hand. With zero hesitation, he cited his date of birth. \u201cJanuary 9, 1989,\u201d Beasley quipped. The performances and post-game quotes were as unlikely as the result itself: a 102-93 Knicks victory over the mighty Celtics, handing them their first back-to-back defeats since opening week. It would have been plausible under the usual script, one in which Porzingis played the lead role and Beasley an extra. The opposite occurred. Hilarity ensued. And the Knicks won."},{"id":48205,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/utah-jazz-donovan-mitchell-toe-out-spurs","date":"2017-12-22","title":"Utah Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell (toe) out vs. Spurs","content":"Rookie Donovan Mitchell will sit out a second consecutive game with an injured toe when his Utah Jazz host the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday night.

Soon, he\u2019ll be playing point guard for the Cavaliers. Thomas said he could be on the floor in games as early as next week for Cleveland after being sidelined with a hip injury that knocked him out of last season\u2019s playoffs. Thomas has progressed to the point where he will be scrimmaging 5 on 5 in the next few days with the possibility of playing in games with the Cavs before the year ends. \u201cWhen that time comes to where I\u2019ll be out there, I\u2019m sure everybody is going to know and I\u2019ll be out there playing the way I\u2019ve always played,\u201d said Thomas, who hosted a holiday party for some area kids at the team\u2019s training facility. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get as close as 100 percent as possible and to be out there to be special. Not just to be out there and be another body. However long that takes \u2013 it might be next week, it might be a week after that. We don\u2019t know and we\u2019re really not trying to put a date on it because it just depends on how my recovery is. \u201cI\u2019m ramping up my workouts, but at the same time it\u2019s how I feel the next day, and it\u2019s getting lighter and lighter, which is a good sign.\u201d Thomas is as close as ever to making his debut with Cleveland, which acquired him last summer in the blockbuster trade that sent Kyrie Irving to Boston. Since training camp opened, the Cavs\u2019 timeline for Thomas was for him to be playing games by the end of December. That now seems possible. The Cavs, who have won 18 of 20, host Chicago on Thursday and are expected to practice twice before their Christmas Day matchup against the Golden State Warriors, whom they\u2019ve met in three straight Finals. * Thomas reveals reaction to Celtics-Cavs trade Cleveland has games in Sacramento and Utah next week before returning home on Jan. 2 against Portland. The next day, the Cavs will play in Boston, where Thomas spent more than two seasons and where he hoped to play longer before being traded. Since the deal, Thomas has talked about being motivated to show the Celtics they were wrong to let him go. Although he has not suited up for the Cavs, Thomas has been embraced by the city\u2019s fans. As a way of giving thanks for their support, he teamed with World Vision \u2013 a humanitarian aid organization he has partnered with for seven years \u2013 to host children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Cleveland at the party. \u201cThe biggest thing is just putting smiles on these kids\u2019 faces,\u201d said Thomas, who played basketball and video games. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or what they don\u2019t have. It\u2019s about having fun today.\u201d Thomas said he has been touched by the warm welcome he\u2019s gotten in Cleveland. \u201cIt\u2019s genuine,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like giving back no matter where I am. That\u2019s just who I am and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been about, so I just try to reach kids and touch kids and show kids I\u2019m just like them.

At one point, he joined a game of \u201cknockout\u201d and was quickly eliminated. \u201cI expected that,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I play knockout with kids they try their hardest to beat me and I always seem to lose.

Like a Joel Embiid-Kristaps Porzingis shootout in the day\u2019s Sixers-Knicks opener, followed by classic LeBron James vs. Kevin Durant (at one end) and Draymond Green (at the other). A slice of last spring\u2019s Wizards-Celtics playoff series would be both naughty and nice for the holiday\u2019s middle game. The Rockets-Thunder showdown packs enormous potential as a West semifinals preview, assuming all the stars are aligned and healthy. By night\u2019s end, all I want for Christmas is a stingy defensive performance from the Timberwolves, just to save coach Tom Thibodeau\u2019s voice for the next day and his molars for the New Year. Shaun Powell : I\u2019d really like to see everyone healthy (other than Steph Curry, who is all but ruled out) and on the floor for Cavs-Warriors. I realize the priority for these teams is summertime, not Christmastime, but this is a national TV game and a chance for the NBA to dominate households. That\u2019s the only game that carries heavy entertainment value and features a pair of true title contenders. Basketball fans deserve a blockbuster game and a chance to dream for a June re-re-re-rematch. John Schuhmann : Any time the Cavs and Warriors play, it\u2019s a must watch. It stinks that Stephen Curry and Isaiah Thomas won\u2019t be in uniform, but both teams are still playing well and the LeBron James-Kevin Durant matchup (with both putting up MVP numbers over the last couple of weeks) is well worth the price of admission. Sekou Smith : The biggest gift of all is the next chapter in the Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry. And there is no other present under the tree that will consume my energy and attention on Christmas Day more than the latest installment (sorry LeBron, but Draymond\u2019s right, this is definitely a rivalry). The players involved can talk all they want about this being just another game and all that stuff, but we all know better. You don\u2019t battle to the final day of the season for three straight years against the same team and not bring that history and drama with you the next time you see them. And I want to know how the dynamic changes for both sides now without Kyrie Irving involved. This game would have been off the charts if Cavaliers All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas was in uniform and ready to play. But I never got that horse I wanted back in the day either, so you take what you can get on the holiday."},{"id":48209,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-next-player-two-jerseys-retirement","date":"2017-12-20","title":"Blogtable: Which player will be next to have two jerseys retired?","content":" * * * Kobe Bryant is the latest player to have two jerseys retired, joining Oscar Robertson, Earl Monroe, Julius Erving, Pete Maravich Shaquille O\u2019Neal and others . Who will be next? * * * David Aldridge : I\u2019ll throw a crazy name out there: How about Ray Allen? Number 34 with the Bucks, Sonics and Heat; number 20 with the Celtics. I\u2019d imagine Milwaukee eventually puts his jersey up, and I think there\u2019s an outside shot Miami does, if only for The Shot in 2013 against the Spurs. And while the C\u2019s are running out of numbers, there\u2019s no doubting Allen\u2019s impact on the 2008 title team and the 2010 Finals team. Steve Aschburner : Before I wade into this one, can I make it known that the late, great Wilt Chamberlain had his jersey number retired by (count \u2018em) all three franchises for which he played. No one else will be wearing No. 13 for the Warriors, the Sixers or the Lakers. And that\u2019s appropriate given the Dipper\u2019s prodigious achievements. OK, now that I\u2019ve touted my favorite NBA player\u2019s lofty status \u2014 and the protocol that multiple retired jersey numbers should require multiple franchises, never two numbers\/one team \u2014 I\u2019ll answer this one as others surely will by saying, \u201cLeBron James.\u201d His No. 23 will hang in Cleveland, his No. 6 will hang in Miami. Might be a while, though, since he\u2019s not done with the former. Kevin Garnett with Minnesota and Boston would be a solid pick, except for his estrangement from the Timberwolves, the franchise with which he\u2019s most associated, and the ceremony delay that\u2019s already causing. Shaun Powell : LeBron James is next up, with Kevin Durant on deck (yes, all hard feelings with OKC will be smoothed over). LeBron will get a statue along with a jersey retirement from the Cavs, and in Miami his jersey will go up next to Dwyane Wade\u2019s and Chris Bosh\u2019s and \u2026 Dan Marino\u2019s and Michael Jordan\u2019s (ask Pat Riley about that). John Schuhmann : LeBron James getting his number retired by both Cleveland and Miami seems a sure thing. It\u2019s just a question of how many more years he\u2019s going to play and if there\u2019s an older guy that qualifies. Steve Nash (Dallas and Phoenix) is a possibility, though the Mavs have allowed a few players to wear No. 13 since he left. It would be interesting to see if the Celtics retire No. 5 for Kevin Garnett, who will certainly have No. 21 in the Minnesota rafters some day. I would think that Vince Carter\u2019s tenure in New Jersey (4 1\/2 years) was too short for the Nets (in addition to the Raptors) to retire his number, but he\u2019s third all-time in points and fifth in assists for their franchise. Chris Paul is worthy of consideration in both New Orleans and L.A. Sekou Smith : LeBron James should be next up on this list , for the time he\u2019s spent in both Cleveland and Miami. He\u2019s won championships in both places and taken those franchises to championship glory. The Heat had been there before but winning two titles in his four seasons and playing for a championship in all four of his seasons should be more than enough to get his Heat No. 6 in the rafters. Regardless if what transpires in free agency in July, LeBron\u2019s already done enough to get not only get a jersey or two retired in Cleveland, but someone should be sketching that statue that should eventually go up in front of Quicken Loans Arena. He\u2019s earned it. And Kevin Durant should be next on the two retired jerseys list (yes, his jersey belongs in the rafters in Oklahoma City one day)."},{"id":48242,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-carmelo-anthony-come-bench","date":"2017-12-20","title":"Blogtable: Would the Oklahoma City Thunder benefit from shifting Carmelo Anthony into a bench role?","content":"* * * The Thunder would be better with Carmelo Anthony coming off the bench. Agree, or disagree? * * * David Aldridge : Of course they would be, but the chances of that happening are roughly equivalent to that of Gigli II: This Time, It\u2019s Worse. Someone e-mailed the same question to me in the Tip this week , and I recalled the story of Michael Jordan\u2019s second and final year with the Wizards, in 2002-03. The year before, he\u2019d gotten worn down and ultimately injured by playing too many minutes. As his second year began, everyone \u2014 including him \u2014 thought he\u2019d be used best as a sixth man. It made all the sense in the world. Jerry Stackhouse was in his prime and he\u2019d start at the two, get the other team into the penalty, and MJ would come in and clean up against reserves who couldn\u2019t handle his\u2026game. Again, everyone agreed on this, starting with Jordan. It lasted exactly 15 games. Coaches coach, Pat Riley used to say. And starters start. Steve Aschburner : Said this at the start of the season, so put me down for \u201cwholeheartedly agree.\u201d Just as with Dwyane Wade in Cleveland, Carmelo Anthony from Day 1 in OKC was ripe for a role off the bench. Such a move would thin the herd of ball dominators out there to start each night and give him a green light to shoot and score in the minutes he does play. It wouldn\u2019t hurt at this stage of his career to be playing against second-unit defenders, either. If we can\u2019t get Olympics \u2018Melo when he\u2019s sharing the Thunder court with actual Team USA guys, we ought to be able to get Retro \u2018Melo in the squint-a-little relative world of backups basketball. Shaun Powell : That seems like the easy \u201clet\u2019s make a move for the sake of making a move\u201d decision but I\u2019m not sure what is accomplishes , other than bruising \u2018Melo\u2019s ego. Besides, the problem isn\u2019t the start of OKC games, it\u2019s the finish, when \u2018Melo, Paul George and Russell Westbrook haven\u2019t figured a way to make it work together and potential wins manage to slip away from them. That should be the focus, not bringing \u2018Melo off the bench and into the game at the eight-minute mark of the first quarter. John Schuhmann : Short answer: Yes. The Thunder have been at their best (plus-9.1 per 100 possessions in 196 minutes \u2013 not a huge sample size, of course) with Paul George and Russell Westbrook on the floor without Anthony. Still, Anthony doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be on the bench at the start of the game to get that look for extended minutes. If that\u2019s what they\u2019re going for, the Thunder can just sub him out a few minutes into the half, and bring him back late in the first and third quarters to anchor the second unit. But for the last few weeks, George (not Anthony) has most often been the All-Star on the floor with the other two on the bench. Billy Donovan has also gone to a five-man bench unit for a few minutes here and there. In the seven December games that OKC has had all three All-Stars, Anthony has played less than seven total minutes with neither George or Russell Westbrook. But no matter how many All-Stars are on the floor, the Thunder need more ball movement and player movement if they\u2019re going to climb out of the bottom 10 in offensive efficiency . Though they\u2019re 7-3 this month, they\u2019re far from finding a rhythm and still rank 24th offensively over those 10 games . Sekou Smith : I think the Thunder would be better off with Carmelo working off the baseline and taking advantage of cross matches during games. He should be used differently no matter what, be it as a starter or otherwise. I think his spot in the starting lineup on this Thunder team is hardly the biggest issue and I can\u2019t figure out why he should be the one to pay for a larger issue, which is a lack of sound structure for three All-Star talents to operate in on a consistent basis. There are clearly chemistry issues with OKC\u2019s hoops holy trinity of \u2018Melo, Paul George and Russell Westbrook. \u2018Melo is is the easy target for scorn in this situation, same as he was in New York in a bad situation. The responsibility to straighten it out, however, is in Billy Donovan\u2019s hands. He\u2019s the man responsible for pulling this thing together, same as every coach who has been gifted a super team in recent seasons."},{"id":48232,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cousins-wall-still-share-college-bond-nba-reunion-would-be-difficult","date":"2017-12-20","title":"Cousins, Wall still share college bond but NBA reunion would be difficult","content":" The idea of DeMarcus Cousins joining John Wall in Washington has been around for a while.

Yes, Elvis-dressed ushers and Elvis races on the video board and Elvis impersonators at halftime and \u2026 well, that\u2019s too cheesy, a lazy thrill. Or just like the city\u2019s favorite sound, they could go full blues. Yes, they could sell it by going from Bruise Brothers \u2014 a word play from their former nickname, Grit \u2019N Grind \u2014 to singing the blues. Well, that might not be the identity this team needs to flaunt at the moment. Fact is, the Grizzlies are transitioning from their impressive past to an uncertain future and could use an image that fits them. Except, there\u2019s nothing that defines them right now, because we no longer know who they are and, evidently, neither do they. All we know is the Grizzlies are free-falling like nobody\u2019s business and hearing all sorts of fan and media trade proposals for Marc Gasol while searching for help from a development strategy that hasn\u2019t produced a rotation player that frightens anyone on the other bench. With only two victories since Nov. 8, a starting point guard who\u2019s still mending and an interim coach who\u2019s still trying to push the right buttons, the Grizzlies are sinking fast and ready to be counted out by the basketball world. The glorified days of Gasol next to Zach Randolph on the blocks and Tony Allen making hell for the other team\u2019s big scorer and Mike Conley being everyone\u2019s Most Underrated Player are definitely over, if only because Z-Bo and Allen got old and left. That group helped the Grizzlies stay locked as a top-five team in the loaded West for several years and until recently used their grit and intimidation to often spook the finesse-y Warriors. What\u2019s left is an achy Conley, a \u201ccoach killer\u201d label for the affable Gasol, a Bad Contract belonging to gimpy Chandler Parsons and a slew of mostly young role players who either haven\u2019t yet or won\u2019t ever be anything special. That won\u2019t get you far in a conference with the Warriors, Spurs, Rockets and revved up Wolves, unless the direction is south. \u201cWe\u2019re not the team we\u2019ve been in the past or the team we\u2019ve shown early in the season,\u201d said Conley. True enough, the Grizz started 5-1 and beat the Warriors and then Rockets twice under David Fizdale, who did solid work last season as head coach (43 wins and \u201ctake that for data\u201d). Then, early this season the organization got whacked upside the head. Fiz and Gasol began butting heads, and their relationship reached a breaking point when Fiz refused to play Gasol down the stretch of a close game against Brooklyn. Once again, Gasol is having a decent season, leading the Grizz in scoring, rebounding and assists, yet he never took off his sweats against the Nets in crunch time. In a sit-down a few days ago with reporters, Gasol pinpointed the relationship breakdown to a home loss to Utah when he shot 4-for-22 and Conley 3-for-16, then accused Fizdale of blaming them as the reason. \u201cI thought that was not really fair,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cWhen you lose, or when somebody has a tough game, you gotta help and figure out ways, and help your players, and he just completely came into me and Mike, and I did not like that one bit. From that point on, things got a little rougher.\u201d Well, Fiz was fired after Gasol complained and \u2026 nothing much has changed. Memphis has melted down, losing 15 of 16 during a stretch. Missing Conley for nearly a month and counting with a bad Achilles hasn\u2019t helped. Yet other than a rollback-the-clock game from Tyreke Evans every now and then, nobody has picked up the slack enough to put the engine in reverse. And so, this is where they are, at 9-21 and searching for a solution before the season slips away. Where did it go wrong? Well, easy: When Conley pulled up lame and when Fizdale failed to connect with one of only two players on the roster that he must keep happy. \u201cFiz did a lot for me, our team and our city and I hated to see a guy like that get fired,\u201d Conley said. Regarding the rift and the surprising fourth-quarter benching of Gasol, Conley said: \u201cTheir relationship wasn\u2019t at its best at the time when we needed it to be. I was a little confused at the time about the whole thing. It was a very winnable game and those thoughts were going through my mind when I looked at the end of the bench and Marc was still there.\u201d The Grizzlies are now on their fourth coach in five years, a pattern that suggests instability at the very worst. And chances are decent they\u2019ll have another coach next year unless JB Bickerstaff rights the ship and the front office feels he\u2019s worthy of being elevated from interim status. \u201cWe have to be able to take what we have now, buy into JB and trust that we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Conley said. Meanwhile, the topic du jour is swapping out Gasol, and his status is a good place to start. Gasol reiterated that while he wouldn\u2019t stand in a way of a trade, he doesn\u2019t want to get traded, in part because his roots run deep into the Memphis mud, starting as a local high school player (while brother Pau played for the Grizz). Basically: Memphis could ship their most tradable asset but there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll fetch what they need or would put them on a better path for the near future. His problem is centers aren\u2019t the marketable ace card as once before. Sure, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns and a few others fly against that theory. And Gasol does appear to have good years left but he turns 33 and would only be appealing to a win-now contender. And how many contenders are willing to boldly shake up their roster in mid-season and take a risk? Which means, the universe for a Gasol trade is small, maybe confined to three or four teams, before the trade deadline. If the Cavaliers are willing to part with the Brooklyn No. 1 pick, it\u2019s hard to imagine the Grizzlies turning that down. It\u2019s also equally as hard as the Cavaliers giving that up. The best Memphis could hope to get for Gasol is a lesser yet younger player, perhaps a low first-rounder with conditions or a second-rounder and a clunky contract tossed in to make the numbers work. And even then, Memphis would need to hope that such player(s) arrive and perform better than expected. Otherwise, nobody else on the Grizzlies roster will fetch anything significant. Conley\u2019s contract is too enormous (and point guards are plentiful anyway). Everyone else is filler. Trading Gasol changes everything, It signals a rebuild, and those are tricky. There\u2019s no guarantee you won\u2019t wind up like Sacramento or Orlando, teams on their third and fourth rebuild. Would the city support that, even though the Grizzlies are the only pro team in town? Keeping Gasol means the Grizzlies intend to take their chances on the season once Conley returns and hope to rally in the second half. Look, it worked for the Miami Heat last season. While the West is top heavy, the bottom half of the playoff eight is the likes of Denver, New Orleans, Portland, Oklahoma City. Not terribly scary. \u201cOnce they said that they were going to move on from Tony and Zach, I guess it was hard, I think, for everybody. At the same time, you look at it as a challenge,\u201d said Gasol. Some help from within would be appreciated. While Parsons is improved and healthier from his corpse of a year ago, he\u2019s still nowhere close to giving the production you want from a player who makes $23 million this year. The Grizzlies owe him two more seasons and he could eventually be a buyout candidate if he can\u2019t improve. Then on the flip side, there\u2019s Evans. He\u2019s the pleasant surprise, a player who has recovered from nagging injuries and address changes to be a refreshingly solid scoring option, especially during Conley\u2019s absence. His three-point shooting hike, from a career in the high-20s to 40 percent this season, is the tonic for a club that once again lacks consistent shooters from the swing position. Evans is averaging 18.3 points and if he keeps this up will be Sixth Man of the Year material. The rest? A mixed bag: JaMychal Green, an aging Mario Chalmers, an inconsistent Ben McLemore and rookie Dillon Brooks. All those years of getting little to nothing from the draft \u2014 none of the Grizzlies\u2019 first-rounders since 2011 are still with the team \u2014 are hurting the club now. The safest route for the Grizzlies is stay the course, hope for a late rush, then save the Gasol Question for the summer, when some teams might offer more in terms of youth\/picks. Of course, that could backfire, and being forced to keep Gasol could keep the Grizzlies a fringe team once again. Complicating matters if the conditional first rounder they owe the Celtics (for the privilege of having Jeff Green for 12 unspectacular months). It\u2019s protected from picks 1-8 in 2019, 1-6 in 2020 and unprotected after that. That\u2019s what makes a complete tear-down tricky and, if it doesn\u2019t fall the Grizzlies\u2019 way, they could be in a lose-lose situation. This year and next is fraught with risk no matter which direction the Grizzlies decide to go. Conley and Co. have no reason to sweat the future; that privilege belongs to GM Chris Wallace and to an extent, owner Robert Pera. Conley rightly is more worried about where the Grizzlies will be by the time he returns. \u201cIt\u2019s been really stressful because it\u2019s all out of my hands,\u201d said Conley. \u201cI can\u2019t control anything, can\u2019t be on the court to help. It\u2019s very hard to sit and watch. I know we wouldn\u2019t be in this position if I was playing. I feel some accountability for this whole thing.\u201d Perhaps due to their stubborn will, or maybe they\u2019re spoiled by past results, Conley and Gasol aren\u2019t giving up on 2017-18, despite where the Grizzlies are trending and what the results are saying. \u201cI don\u2019t have a season to throw away,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI\u2019m not 23, 24, where I can just say, `Well, next year it\u2019s going to be better.\u2019 I have that sense of urgency and desire to win that obviously, as your career gets past 10 years, and with the foot injury that I had a couple years ago, you know that at any time this might be it. I hope that during the next five, six weeks before the break that the situation has completely changed, turned around, and we are a much more consistent team going forward.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

He grew up in Birmingham, spent that one season in Lexington and then split his first seven NBA seasons between Los Angeles (three) and Phoenix (four). What\u2019s been fairly mild for the folks accustomed to the rough months in southeastern Wisconsin still has been a harsh slap to Bledsoe\u2019s 28-year-old cheeks. Bledsoe\u2019s wife Morgan and kids Eriauna and Ethan are some 1,500 miles away, staying in Arizona aside from a trek or two north to visit, the latest for Christmas. Morgan owns her own hair salon, which lent at least a little credibility to Bledsoe\u2019s claims about his now-infamous \u201cI Dont wanna be here\u201d Tweet three games into the season. The point guard claimed it was the salon, not the 0-3, firing-their-coach-Earl-Watson Suns, that he wanted to bolt. General manager Ryan McDonough didn\u2019t buy that. So he sat Bledsoe down on Oct. 23 and, two weeks and eight games later, ended his Phoenix tenure by trading him to the Bucks for big man Greg Monroe and a pair of conditional draft picks. Since then, there have been no \u201cI wanna be here\u201d messages about Milwaukee in the @EBled2 feed, just a lot of thank-you responses to fans, some retweeted highlight plays and the stray recommendation for a late-night wings stop. Bledsoe has made his presence known with his play, helping the Bucks to an 11-7 mark since his arrival. A 20-point, six-assist man in his two final Suns seasons, Bledsoe\u2019s numbers are down a bit in Milwaukee ( 17.5 ppg, 4.2 apg ) but his impact is up. He has formed what\u2019s gaining some traction as a \u201cKEG\u201d threat with Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 Milwaukee, keg, get it? \u2014 to become the highest scoring trio (67.2 ppg) in the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference. Heading into their clash Tuesday with conference honcho Cleveland, the Bucks have scored at least 100 points in 11 consecutive games, their longest such streak since 1990-91. They have turned over the ball 11 times or fewer in seven of their past eight games. And Bledsoe\u2019s winning numbers are strong: a plus-7.0 per 48 minutes for a team that is a minus-0.5 overall, and a net rating of plus 6.6 (per 100 possessions) that is 1.6 better than MVP aspirant Antetokounmpo. Bledsoe took time after a Bucks practice and a players association meeting late last week to talk with NBA.com about his new surroundings, his switch to a playoff contender, his strong view on hoops analytics and his \u201cMini-LeBron\u201d nickname, among other things: NBA.com: So it was Jamal Crawford, when you were both with the Clippers, who tagged you with the \u201cMini-LeBron\u201d nickname. How did that come about? Eric Bledsoe : He\u2019d tell me he had guys like Blake [Griffin], D.J. [DeAndre Jordan], my main guy CP3 [Chris Paul] telling him how I\u2019d stand out every time I get in the game, doing the stuff I do. He\u2019d really only seen selected things, like blocking shots or chasing down shots, or getting a crazy dunk or something else to stand out from the crowd. He just started calling me that. NBA.com : So it was for your versatility or your physicality? EB : It was kind of both. The way I was built, my body. The way I played. Pretty much a little of everything. NBA.com : Have you always been built like a fullback? EB : I was actually smaller in high school, but I always played stronger than what I was. So my game pretty much hasn\u2019t changed. NBA.com : Can you imagine the type of player you\u2019d be in you were 6-foot-8? EB : That\u2019s what Jamal told me, that if I were 6-8, I\u2019d probably be the same player [LeBron James is]. NBA.com : With the dunks and the chasedowns and the \u2026 EB : It\u2019s normal to me. It\u2019s just talked about by everybody else because of my size. And they don\u2019t expect me to do those type of things. Where now that I\u2019ve been in the league this long, [opponents] kind of expect it. Even when I try to chase down and block somebody\u2019s shot, I can see \u2018em looking back at me. Where they\u2019re aware of it. NBA.com : What sort relationship do you have with LeBron? EB : He\u2019s like a big brother to me. I used to call him, text him for advice, on leading my team and stuff like that. He\u2019s a great friend. NBA.com : When did your paths first cross? EB : My first time meeting him was in college \u2014 he came to one of our practices in Kentucky. It just went on from there. Then I became friends with Chris Paul and he was around, and then it started growing from there. NBA.com : You invited him to your wedding in July? EB : Of course. He couldn\u2019t make it. I really only had my two best friends from the NBA there, John [Wall] and DeMarcus [Cousins]. They were the only ones from the league there. NBA.com : I saw an issue of \u201cMuscle & Fitness\u201d magazine last spring in which you and your family were featured. EB : That diet thing just came from me being injured. It had nothing to do with how strong I was. It was just about me trying to take care of my body [while hurt]. How to eat right, things like that. Just provide energy, really. NBA.com : It sounded as if you\u2019re not as committed to weights as your upper body might suggest. EB : Nah, I don\u2019t hit the weights as far as trying to get stronger. I try to do more stuff as far as balance, keeping my hips low. Core\u2019s tight. Never me bench-pressing the max I can, nothing like that. NBA.com : I spent one season covering your college, Kentucky, for the Lexington newspaper. The claim back then was, under Joe B. Hall, the basketball team had more players who could bench-press 300 pounds than the football team. EB : Oh wow, I didn\u2019t know that. Not so good for the football team. Basketball, I don\u2019t think is played on strength like that. NBA.com : Your time with the Clippers led to a friendship with Chris Paul too. What was that like, playing the point guard position behind him? EB : Oh yeah, I learned a lot from him. Just how engaged he is, how he prepared each and every game. He\u2019s a winner. And that\u2019s what I learned from him: no matter the circumstances, no matter how he felt each game, he always brought it. Every night. Even if a night wasn\u2019t going his way, he found a way to win. He never scored the most points every night or had every assist every night, but he always found a way for his team to win. He found a way to lock in. NBA.com : We always hear that the measure of a good young point guard is knowing when to tell teammates \u201cno\u201d when they want the ball. EB : Of course. That\u2019s a thing with point guards, especially veterans. Players respect the veteran point guards more than they do a rookie. They get it from watching you play \u2014 some players might hate you from playing against you, but love having you play on their team. In Chris\u2019 situation, he\u2019s been an All-Star and won in this league, and people pretty much respect that. Me, I\u2019m trying to get up in that category. NBA.com : It seems as if you had a pretty short learning curve getting accustomed to the Bucks players\u2019 games. EB : Of course. That\u2019s the whole point as a professional athlete. You study the game, you pretty much know every team\u2019s tendencies because you\u2019ve been in the league. I\u2019ve been in the league eight years so I\u2019ve played against Milwaukee twice a year. I pretty much knew the guys and their games. But the relationships don\u2019t get built till you get on a team. You know their tendencies before you know their personalities. NBA.com : Is it challenging to go against friends? EB : Nah, because once you get on the court, it\u2019\u2019s all about winning. That\u2019s what makes the relationship even bigger. Coming at each other. Me and John [Wall] probably go at each other every time we step on the court. We\u2019re best of friends, but at the same time, we know each other is gonna bring it. So we can\u2019t slack that night. That\u2019s pretty much every night but playing against them, you want to beat \u2018em. It\u2019s their team against yours and you both know what it is. NBA.com : What do you make of this Bucks team after your first 18 games with them? EB : We\u2019re playing hard, man. Like I said, that\u2019s 90 percent of it. I mean, I don\u2019t know all the plays. I\u2019m not perfect out there. But what I do, I give my all. Any player who has great passion, who knows how to play the game and goes out there giving it his all, you\u2019re pretty much going to have a great outcome. Each and every night is not going to be pretty. You see teams that have been together for a while still losing. NBA.com : Are you satisfied with your production to this point? EB : I thought I was going to be playing a whole lot better. And I\u2019ve still got a long ways to go. I put in the work this summer and it\u2019s showing little by little. It\u2019s only going to get better. It\u2019s just being patient and playing hard. Even though we\u2019re not clicking like we should be, it\u2019s gonna come. We just have to keep playing hard like we\u2019ve been doing, play great defense and have fun. NBA.com : Your shooting suffered when you first got to Milwaukee .Did you know why? EB : I can\u2019t even tell you. I hadn\u2019t played in about two weeks. I can go out in practice and make all my shots, but come into a game and miss all of \u2018em. NBA.com : During that time, did you consciously try to dial up your defensive performance? EB : That\u2019s what most players know about me, that I can change the game without scoring or even having a good offensive night. I can always make trouble for who I guard and control the effort I bring. You can shoot the ball out there and not make it and win. You can have a low energy game, and it affects the whole team. NBA.com : The numbers suggest your impact has been considerable. Are you a fan of analytics ? EB : I hate it. Yeah. Somehow it can show that an average player can be better than a superstar player in some aspects, and that don\u2019t mean nothing. It\u2019s all about wins, losses and the effort you bring every night. Analytics, sometimes I don\u2019t get it. \u2026 You\u2019re going to put your best five on the court, analytics or not. NBA.com : What has Milwaukee been like for you away from the court? EB : It\u2019s tough. Getting used to the cold weather. My family is home, my kids are in school. Kentucky and Alabama get cold but they don\u2019t get this cold. It\u2019s a different type of cold. I don\u2019t really see snow too often so I was pretty excited to see it. I know it can get overwhelming sometimes though. NBA.com : Thoughts on seeing up close and playing with Giannis? EB : It\u2019s crazy. I didn\u2019t understand how talented he is. The guy can score 30 points and he doesn\u2019t even make a 3-pointer. It\u2019s crazy to see because he works hard on his shooting. Once he figures that out, he\u2019s gonna be scary. Then he\u2019s gonna start picking teams apart. NBA.com : Have you consciously tried to reduce his workload? EB : I do, I do. That\u2019s what good players do, try to help their team. The point guard is the most important position on the court. They often have to be the best player, not by choice but because that\u2019s what the game demands as far as all the thinking you have to do and picking and choosing when to score or pass, things like that. NBA.com : You guys have had a rash of injuries, from Jabari Parker\u2019s second ACL recovery to Matthew Dellavedova, Tony Snell, Mirza Teletovic and Jason Terry. Has that made things more difficult? EB : People got to step up. I thought some guys from our bench did a great job: Gary Payton [II], Rashad [Vaughn], Sterling [Brown]. DeAndre [Liggins], Malcolm [Brogdon]. They did a great job of giving us that boost. NBA.com : We\u2019re far enough removed from the trade now to wonder, was it awkward the way you exited Phoenix? EB : No. I was pretty much like, \u2018Whatever.\u2019 I just wanted to get in a better situation. NBA.com : Have you changed your approach to social media? EB : No. What I tweeted had nothing to do with what was going on. It\u2019s just that we lost three straight games, the coach getting fired. That was the only thing that everybody was alluding to. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about it, it had nothing to do with that. NBA.com : Do you still keep one eye on the Suns? EB : Oh yeah, man, I watch \u2018em. But I love watching basketball. I\u2019ll watch anybody, I\u2019ll watch college. Try to get better, steal people\u2019s moves, try to see where we can get better wacthing players we have to play the next game. Watching my games, seeing where I can get better as far as turning the ball over or getting people their shots. I pretty much watch everything. NBA.com : Now that you\u2019ve been traded twice, how do the experiences compare? EB : Actually, it was the same to me. The first time, I pretty much knew I had to get traded, just on the strength of everything that was going on, them having to sign Chris, my contract coming up. So I kind of knew I had to spread out a little bit. It was time. This time, it was better for me. I\u2019d get a chance to play for something and a chance to see how good I am, as far as helping a team achieve what it needs to achieve. NBA.com : The veterans you\u2019re friends with, the stars, all talk about their legacies. What about you, what are you seeking here? EB : I mean, I want to be one of the best point guards in the league. And I\u2019ve got a chance to, playing alongside great players, a great team, a great coach who\u2019s been considered one of those at the point. NBA.com : How helpful is Jason Kidd, as far as coaching point guards after being Hall of Fame-worthy at that spot? EB : Oh yeah, he\u2019s competitive, man. I was talking to one of the coaches who was on the staff when he played, and he told me how prepared [Kidd] was in practice, how he wanted to win each and every drill. And that shows on the court. You can tell even though he ain\u2019t playing, how he\u2019s competitive for us out there. We\u2019ll go through plays and he\u2019ll tell us not to be robots out there. NBA.com : Have you gotten any particularly tips from Kidd\u2019s game? EB : Nah, he just told me I\u2019ve got to bring it. And lead these guys. Every time I check out of a game, he tells me that. When I\u2019m out there on the court, they look for me, they wait for the plays to be called, they want me setting the tone defensively. NBA.com : Have you sought out Malcolm Brogdon, last year\u2019s Rookie of the Year and now your backup, to smooth over any potential bruised feedlings? EB : No, I wasn\u2019t sensitive about it. It\u2019s basketball. Malcolm, he\u2019s a pro. He has great vets here. He\u2019s definitely got to be a professional with it. With him being a young player and me a veteran now, I\u2019ve talked to him while games are going on. Just how we need him to be aggressive and get everybody in their spots. NBA.com : What has the key been to living away from your family for the first time? EB : They visited up here once \u2014 they just left \u2014 and they\u2019re coming back for Christmas and all. With the kids, [the key is] FaceTime. We\u2019ve got a lot of FaceTime in. It is [hard to be Dad]. I\u2019m not there physically but they see a lot of me on the cell phone now.

Relative to the league\u2019s reigning dyspeptic duo, anyway. The 2017-18 season hardly could have begun worse for Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis of the Chicago Bulls. Vying for the starter\u2019s role and minutes at power forward for a team intending to be bad, the competition on the practice floor led to irritation and instigation, which in turn led to confrontation and conflagration. Portis punched a reportedly salty Mirotic , breaking two bones in the man\u2019s face and sending him to the hospital on Oct. 17. The blow sidelined Mirotic for the season\u2019s first seven weeks. It sent Portis into exile on an eight-game suspension. It opened a door of opportunity for rookie Lauri Markkanen, along with several cans of worms for coach Fred Hoiberg and the Bulls:  How serious were reports that Mirotic wanted either Portis or himself traded before he returned to NBA action? Would teammates choose sides? What did the little skirmish mean to either player\u2019s trade value? And if the front office opted not to have its hand forced into an either\/or situation, could the two co-exist peacefully \u2013 or at minimum, professionally enough to play productive basketball without distractions or further incidents? The answer to that last one, at least through Mirotic\u2019s season debut 10 days ago, has been negative. The two have not been merely productive \u2013 they\u2019ve been remarkably so, by the Bulls\u2019 standards anyway. Starting with Chicago\u2019s game at Charlotte on Dec. 8, Mirotic\u2019s return, the lottery-balls-or-bust Bulls have gone undefeated. Let\u2019s repeat that \u2013 Chicago has a five-game winning streak , after going 3-20 through the schedule\u2019s first seven weeks. As they prepped to face Philadelphia Monday night at the United Center, the Bulls had topped 100 points in each of those five victories, after doing that only eight times in the first 23 games. Mirotic is averaging 20.0 points and 6.2 rebounds since he\u2019s been back while shooting 53.8 percent, including 15-for-30 on 3-pointers. Portis is at 12.9 points and 6.8 rebounds , shooting 49 percent and 39 percent from the arc, with a career-best 27 points off the bench and 12 rebounds at Milwaukee Friday. Other players have shined during the streak: guard Kris Dunn and Markkanen look like solid pieces that, when Zach LaVine returns from his ACL rehab, will soothe whatever sting remains from the Jimmy Butler trade with Minnesota last June. Center Robin Lopez continues to do a few things very well, boosting his trade value as the February deadline approaches. Undrafted waivers pickup David Nwaba, 24, has been surprisingly helpful on the wing since being salvaged off basketball\u2019s scrap heap, even effectively guarding while giving up seven inches to the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo. But Mirotic and Portis, to blame for the dark headlines back in October, have been largely responsible for the happier ones lately. Through the weekend, having played together for 54 minutes, the two had a plus\/minus in combination of plus-6.8 points , plus-5.0 in fourth quarters alone. Per 100 possessions, using Mirotic and Portis together made the Bulls 30.8 points better , including a 59.5 net rating in the fourth quarter. This is a team, overall, with a 98.3 offensive rating and 107.1 defensive rating prior to facing Philadelphia. For an organization where the reference point for 1 + 1 equaling 3 is Michael Jordan plus Scottie Pippen, Mirotic and Portis \u2013 more tantrum than tandem \u2013 have been special. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about how well those two have played with each other out there on the floor,\u201d Hoiberg said after beating the Bucks Friday. \u201cThey\u2019ve really shown great chemistry and obviously [we] hope to keep it up.\u201d Having two largely interchangeable bigs with 3-point range gives Hoiberg the opportunity to run some high-low stuff, while opening lanes for Dunn, Nwaba, Justin Holiday or other guards. They\u2019re big enough to handle whatever size threats come their way in the 2017 NBA. With Mirotic, Hoiberg talked about one of the fifth-year veteran\u2019s experience. \u201cHe\u2019s been in that situation before,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s really one of the few guys on this roster who has played big crunch time minutes. \u2026 The five that we\u2019ve won, four of them have been one- or two-possession games. Niko\u2019s made big plays, really, in all of them.\u201d Hoiberg said he was proud that \u201cthree or four guys [had] blood on their uniforms\u201d after Saturday\u2019s victory at Milwaukee. Better still, none of it had been spilled by a teammate. Speaking of Portis, the coach said: \u201cThe big thing is his aggressiveness. He hit a couple three\u2019s early, which was big for his confidence. To come out, we were really sluggish and Bobby really kind of took the lid off the rim. And in the fourth quarter, Bobby\u2019s a guy who plays with no fear.\u201d As the puncher rather than the punched, Portis shouldn\u2019t have any fear. Mirotic, better still, isn\u2019t flinching from contact or otherwise playing shy. About the only thing the two have been shy about is mending their relationship off the court. They talk and communicate as required when they\u2019re in the game, and there have been several situational fist bumps out of habit. Other than that, though, everything is up, over and through the transom of media, coaches or teammates. Specifically, Mirotic shook off the idea that they would celebrate beating the Bucks by popping open some beverages together on the bus back to Chicago. \u201cWe don\u2019t go that way,\u201d the 26-year-old native of Montenegro said. \u201cOn the floor we spoke.\u201d Both do grasp the irony that their combined efforts are so effective of late for Chicago, considering they could hardly be further apart emotionally. \u201cEverything\u2019s for the team,\u201d said Portis, 22, as he dressed kitty-corner \u2013 as far away as possible \u2013 from Mirotic in the visitors\u2019 locker room Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re professionals, we\u2019re basketball players and this is our job. Plus we have to come in here every day and put our shoes on like everybody else puts their shoes on, and find a way to make it work. I feel like we\u2019ve done that up to this point. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun playing with Niko. He\u2019s a helluva player. He\u2019s been playing out of his mind since he\u2019s been back. I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d Even if the differences between Mirotic and Portis are irreconcilable, the NBA has a long history of teammates who didn\u2019t take long moonlight strolls together or even get along at all. Most workplaces have. And if there are any specific downsides to these two not being pals \u2013 except upon tipoff \u2013 it\u2019s that Markkanen\u2019s recent back spasms opened up the starting job for Mirotic (which he had won in training camp pre-punch) and that some Bulls fans are worried that even 10 days of success might torpedo management\u2019s tanking mission. There are ways to address both issues, just as long as it\u2019s done without anybody slugging anyone. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Right now, we appear to have nine playoff contenders in the West. The Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs are once again at the top of the standings , and the third-place Spurs are three games ahead of the fourth-place Minnesota Timberwolves. But there are just three games separating the Wolves from the ninth-place Utah Jazz, and every team from 4-9 in the West has had its ups and downs. This week would be a good time for more ups, because from Monday to Saturday, there are 10 games to be played between the top nine teams in the West. Throw in a Christmas game between the Rockets and Thunder, and we have 11 big Western Conference games in the next eight days. The Nuggets and Jazz will play four games against their fellow West contenders, while the Blazers will play three. The only team exempt from the action is the seventh-place New Orleans Pelicans, who are playing three games Southeast Division.

And then, in the next breath, came the stiletto \u2014 \u201cI should have gone to college, huh?\u201d It was a reminder of one of my less than prescient moments, when I\u2019d taken the word of a scout that I trusted, who said that Bryant had made a terrible mistake coming straight out of high school for the NBA in 1996, and should have gone to Duke, his college of choice. That Bryant had averaged a pedestrian 7.6 points on 42 percent shooting his rookie season with the Lakers made the scout\u2019s opinion seem, at the time, somewhat valid. I parroted that opinion on national television. Bryant waited. Years. Like the Count of Monte Cristo. But he finally got the last word. His obsession with greatness allowed him to use slights like that as fuel, to propel him to fantastic feats. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone scored more points in NBA history; only Wilt Chamberlain scored more points in a single game than Bryant\u2019s 81 against the Raptors in 2006. His career was winding down when the arguments that he was wholly inefficient as a player were gaining traction; the end of Bryant\u2019s career, slowed already by injuries, was further stalled by the notion that he wasn\u2019t \u201cclutch\u201d and shot way too much. Well, I\u2019d just say not too many people get their jerseys retired by their former teams. And none that I can recall are getting both of their jerseys retired, as the Lakers will do for Bryant\u2019s number 8 and 24 tonight at Staples Center, at halftime of L.A.\u2019s game with the Warriors ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ). Perhaps only Magic Johnson was as beloved a Laker in Los Angeles as Bryant was. There was no competition during those years: fans liked Shaq\u2019s shtick and marveled at his ferocious dunks. But they revered Bryant, bought his jerseys in bulk. They roared when he came down the lane and dunked on someone\u2019s head. And when Jerry Buss had to choose between the two, in 2004 \u2026 Well, there wasn\u2019t a choice. Bryant was younger, more dedicated \u2014 and there was no way in hell Buss was going to let Bryant walk to the Clippers. *  Blogtable: Who\u2019s the greatest Laker of all-time? So Bryant stayed, led the Lakers to two more rings, and retired as the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in games and minutes played, points and steals, and remains second to Johnson in triple-doubles. Tickets for tonight\u2019s game against the Warriors are reportedly the most expensive in the league for a regular season tilt since Bryant\u2019s final game, at the end of the 2015-16 season, when he scored 60 against Utah . His impact on the generation that came after him is undeniable, unassailable \u2014 he was beloved by the millennials that now have sway. \u201cFor me, Kobe was a big part of The Process,\u201d the 76ers\u2019 emerging star center Joel Embiid said earlier this month. \u201cI think, actually, he was the main part. I\u2019m 23, and I started playing basketball when I was 16. And the first time I watched basketball was, I think it was 2009 or 2010. And I was watching the Finals, and it was Kobe and the Lakers against, I think it was Orlando. And they won that series. And that\u2019s how I became, I started liking basketball and I became a Kobe fan. And that\u2019s why I wanted to start playing basketball, but my dad didn\u2019t let me start until 2011. So I feel like Kobe is like the main part. Because just watching that Finals, he just made me want to play basketball. He just made me want to reach this level. So I\u2019m really thankful for him.\u201d Bryant was a sponge. He soaked in information and processed it, seemingly overnight. If he desperately wanted to be Michael Jordan when he first came into the league \u2014 down to the mannerisms, voice patterns and game \u2014 he quickly evolved into his own man on the floor, a killer among killers. \u201cWhatever you think of this kid \u2014 you love him, you hate him \u2014 there\u2019s five things you absolutely cannot take away from Kobe Bryant,\u201d said the Lakers\u2019 longtime head athletic trainer, Gary Vitti. \u201cThe first one is talent. He had a lot of talent. He was not the most talented. And I\u2019ve had this conversation with him. He would agree with me. There were other players who were more talented than him. So what was it about him that he had five rings, and some other players who were more talented ended up with none? Well, those other four things, beyond talent were, two, he worked harder than anybody else. And there\u2019s a lot of players who work hard. But he worked hard, and equally with purpose. So he worked hard with purpose. He was smart about it. \u201cThe third thing was how competitive he was. He\u2019s absolutely, hands down, the most competitive human being that I\u2019ve been around. And if he lost, he used the loss to come back even stronger. The fourth thing is, tough. Tough as nails. Tougher than anybody I\u2019ve been around. Basically removed the words \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 and \u2018won\u2019t\u2019 out of his lexicon, and replaced them with \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018will.\u2019 And the last thing was, Kobe was intellectually brilliant at basketball. He studied the game. He could tell you players way back in history, when he was a little kid, maybe before he was born, that he studied their game. And he studied the game right up until his last game.\u201d  His offseason workouts, his pre-practice habits, his desire not just to win, but to dominate and obliterate \u2014 all of it made him, if not Jordan, the closest thing we\u2019ve seen to Jordan, and that is remarkable on its own terms. \u201cThere was a lot of tough guys in their own right,\u201d said Pelicans guard Tony Allen, a three-time all-NBA first team defense selection. \u201cMore likely, it was him, though. I can\u2019t think of nobody else. Because there wasn\u2019t nothing you could really take away. If you sag off him, he can hit two threes in a row, which makes you respect him on the perimeter. If you get close to him, now he\u2019s driving to the basket. Now you\u2019re putting the pressure on your big. He done got your big in foul trouble.\u201d Allen is an all-time trash talker. He quickly realized he was out of his league where Bryant was concerned. \u201cI learned my lesson my rookie year (2004, in Boston), when I was talking to him,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe fouled me out in like seven or eight minutes. From that point on, I knew I couldn\u2019t talk to him. He was kind of buttering me up. He\u2019s asking me where am I from, how you doing young fella, where you from, I like your heart, young fella. Before you know it he\u2019s head faked you three times and got the and one off the backboard, came off the pick and roll and dunked on you.\u201d When Allen was in Boston, the Celtics had their version of the \u201cJordan Rules\u201d for Bryant. \u201cKobe was so difficult,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who tried to devise ways to slow Bryant down while in Boston with then-lead assistant Tom Thibodeau. \u201cI always tell the story when I was playing for the Knicks, and (Pat) Riley came in and read us Jordan\u2019s statistics,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe thought they were made up, because back then, we don\u2019t know how he could know this \u2026 And he said Jordan shot 54 (percent) going right, and 52 going left. And I remember (John) Starks saying \u2018What the hell \u2014 why would you tell us that?\u2019 And Kobe was similar to that; his stats were similar going both ways.\u201d As with all great scorers, the Celtics wanted to try and force Bryant baseline. \u201cWe did not want him in the middle of the floor, because he could pass, he could shoot \u2014 and he was going to shoot, most likely,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut middle of the floor Kobe was more dangerous than on the sides. So that\u2019s what we would try to do. And then we would trap him out of timeouts, on any catch out of timeouts.\u201d Allen would start his prep work for Bryant days in advance. \u201cI\u2019d get the edit before and I would always ask for his moves in transition,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI\u2019d get about 10, 12 clips of him in transition, 10, 12 clips of him on the post, 10, 12 clips of him going left, 10, 12 clips of him going right. And just trying to cut off space when he gets in those areas. Not let him do those herky-jerk moves. And if he do make one of those herky-jerk moves and fades away, don\u2019t get discouraged. Later in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to become a tough shot. Early on, when he was fresh, I knew for sure he was going to hit those shots. He\u2019s got plenty of highlights when he\u2019s hit shots like that. He hit \u2018em late, too, but you could live with those type of tough shots at the end. Just finding out his tendencies. And that was all a part of watching film.\u201d Bryant could will himself as few others could. A lot of players would not have overcome waiving off Malone in an All-Star Game. A lot of players would never have recovered from shooting airball after airball in the deciding game of a playoff series in their rookie season, as Bryant did against the Jazz in 1997. \u201cI kept shaking my head like, he\u2019s going to shoot another one,\u201d said Bucks assistant coach Greg Foster, who was a Utah reserve. \u201cI remember in my mind thinking \u2018This kid\u2019s got some big balls.\u2019\u201d Foster later was Bryant\u2019s teammate in Los Angeles, and witnessed the feud between Bryant and O\u2019Neal develop and fester in real time. It was a mark of both men that the Lakers won three straight championships in the midst of their squabbling, yet rarely showed any signs of it on the floor. \u201cMost teams, because we were older, I wouldn\u2019t say we scoffed at it, but we shook our head about it,\u201d Foster said. \u201cBeing an older group, you try to remain neutral with respect to that stuff. But it was real. It was very real. It was happening. I think if it was a younger team, that kind of thing could have created a huge problem \u2026 We could absorb that (bleep), and police it. It couldn\u2019t stop the common goal we all had to win a championship. We could freeze the BS. Those guys had voices. If you put them on another team, guys are gonna clique up, guys are gonna pick a side. I think Brian Shaw was definitely instrumental in that.\u201d And, of course, Bryant\u2019s will was the stuff of legend. He badly sprained his ankle after Game 2 of the 2000 Finals, an injury that normally would have kept him out two or three weeks; he was back five days later, for Game 4, and stepped in after O\u2019Neal fouled out, dominating the overtime and giving the Lakers a breakthrough win that led to the group\u2019s first title together. He was, in Vitti\u2019s famous phrase, \u201cdoubled over like a cooked shrimp\u201d after suffering food poisoning before Game 2 of the Western Conference finals in 2002 against Sacramento; he played that night and scored 22 points. And, finally (well, not finally; he played parts of three more seasons after that), there was April 12, 2013, when the Lakers played the Warriors just before the start of the playoffs. After 45 minutes that night, and the more than 45,000 minutes that preceded it, Bryant\u2019s Achilles\u2019 gave out . \u201cYou know what he said to me when I got out there?,\u201d Vitti recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018I think I ruptured my Achilles.\u2019 I said \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s what it looked like.\u2019 I said \u2018Let me ask you this: did it feel like somebody kicked you in the back of the leg, and you turned around and there was nobody there?\u2019 He said \u2018Exactly.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s what you did.\u2019 And he says, \u2018I tried to pull it back down.\u2019 The guy\u2019s (bleeped) up. \u2018What do you mean, you tried to pull it down \u2014 and, what, try to weld it back on? What were you going to do, staple it back on? I said, that\u2019s not going to work, man.\u2019 And then he said to me, \u2018Can we go in the back, and tape it up?\u2019 And I said, no, that\u2019s not going to work, either.\u201d Vitti told Bryant he\u2019d let him shoot the free throws, but afterward, the Lakers would take a deliberate foul and take Bryant out. Vitti asked if he wanted to come out and let someone else shoot the free throws. Of course, Bryant declined. He limped to the bench, and after the timeout, he limped back on the floor. \u201cI think Mark Jackson was the coach, and I told Mark what we were going to do,\u201d Vitti said. \u201cI told the officials what we were going to do. As soon as we fouled, I walked out on the court to get him. And I said, \u2018You want a chair?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m walking off.\u2019 And he walked all the way back to the training room on his own power. That was a message to Paul Pierce. \u2018Cause you remember in the (2008) Finals, Pierce looked like he got shot by a sniper, rolling around, writhing in pain ? They take him off on a chair and he comes back and plays and they beat us? That was Kobe\u2019s (bleep) you to Paul Pierce.\u201d He said that a lot, literally and figuratively, to enemies real and perceived. For two decades, he made the Lakers must see TV, and gave them a chance to win championships. That is not a job for the squeamish, or the humble. Kobe Bean Bryant was the right man for the right role, brash enough to give himself his own nickname, and secure enough in his abilities to want two jerseys. He dominated in both. As ever, he never forgot what made him great, no matter what number he was wearing at the moment. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

That you can say about Marc Gasol, in the most trying of his 10 NBA seasons. For a decade, he\u2019s been the centerpiece of the Memphis Grizzlies, a small-market team that has managed to remain relevant in the NBA with a style all its own \u2014 Grit-\u2018N-Grind \u2014 that captured the city\u2019s fanbase and made Memphis a team that no one wanted to play on a Tuesday night. The Grizzlies rarely have been a true contender, making the Western Conference finals just once, and giving Golden State all it wanted in the second round in 2014; if the Dubs hadn\u2019t come up with putting Andrew Bynum on Tony Allen rather than Gasol, allowing Bogut to zone up and help bring double-teams Gasol\u2019s and Zach Randolph\u2019s way, we could have well been downing stacks at Central BBQ while watching the Grizz and Cavs in the 2015 Finals. That\u2019s how effective Gasol has been, a load at both ends of the floor, which has included a 2012-13 NBA Defensive Player of the Year award and three All-Star apperances. But the last few years have been more mixed, as the 32-year-old Gasol has had to adapt to both defending stretch fives around the league while becoming one himself. That push and pull between Gasol and the Grizzlies\u2019 now-former coach, David Fizdale, was central to Fizdale\u2019s ouster just one year and 19 games into his tenure last month. Yet Gasol hasn\u2019t hidden or no-commented his way out of addressing his relationship with Fizdale; very calmly, he explains his side of the story, over and over, to anyone that asks. And he swears he wants to be part of the solution to the clear and present problem in Memphis, where the Grizz are in freefall, at 9-20, just a game ahead of Dallas, which has all but taken out house ads acknowledging its rebuild. Yet the Grizzlies are adamant that they won\u2019t move either Gasol or Mike Conley, still on the shelf with an Achilles\u2019 injury. \u201cHe\u2019s been trying,\u201d interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said last week. \u201cHe\u2019s been giving it all he\u2019s got. He\u2019s obviously frustrated with where we are right now. Nobody likes losing. And he\u2019s one of the most competitive guys I\u2019ve been around.\u201d Bickerstaff is moving him around a little, putting him more in the post early rather than having him on the perimeter as much as Fizdale did. But these are, relatively speaking, small moves. How long can Gasol handle being in a losing situation, and how long can Memphis wait before pulling the trigger on a full rebuild that would almost certainly involve moving their franchise\u2019s best all-time player? Me: How are you holding up? Marc Gasol: The struggle right now is the toughest part. Trying to figure out ways to make the team believe, that\u2019s been my main focus. Me: It\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve been in this kind of situation, where you\u2019re losing so many games. That produces far different emotions. How are you processing those emotions? MG: You read the play that\u2019s in front of you. You don\u2019t try to look back; you don\u2019t look forward. You deal with the game that you have in front of you. I try not to think about how many games we\u2019ve lost in the last three, four weeks. I only try to worry about, how can I make the team stronger tonight? And how we build some momentum going forward. That\u2019s my only concern. Me: Are you concerned at all that your reputation may be taking a hit here? MG: No. Because I believe that whatever the scenario might be, whatever people might think, things don\u2019t work that easy. It\u2019s not that simple. Obviously, the first instinct is to think, Wwell, Marc got Fizdale out of there.\u2019 This is an NBA team. Things don\u2019t work that way. Was it an ideal situation? Were we agreed on everything? No. I could have done a better job, for sure. Anything having to do with basketball, I\u2019m the second-most responsible guy out there. But as far as the other stuff, it don\u2019t work that way. Me: Has it been just the injuries that have tripped the team up so far? MG: No. I think we allowed some bad habits to be built up. We got away with it for some time. Eventually, we kind of got hit with a lot of stuff at the same time. And we haven\u2019t been able to recover as fast as possible. Obviously we lost, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only selfish stuff that\u2019s hurt us. Everybody\u2019s trying to fix it their own way. And everybody\u2019s so focused on what we need to do offensively. Which, obviously, is a huge part of the game. But I think consistency is found in defense. And our defense has been everything but consistent. Me: You\u2019re going to tell me you want to stay here. But I would think you\u2019d understand if people don\u2019t believe that. MG: Perception, that\u2019s kind of the same thing, right? Perception is everywhere around, everywhere else. You can\u2019t control that. All you can control is your commitment to these guys in the locker room, to the guys that are on the bus, the guys that go through shootaround, through practice. That\u2019s all that really matters. That\u2019s who you show your commitment to. And obviously, on the floor when you play in front of your fans. The perception from somebody\u2019s that\u2019s not even close to Memphis? I mean, they can think and say and have whatever opinion they\u2019re entitled to. I\u2019m respectful of that. Me: Is J.B. putting you in different spots on the floor? MG: Yeah. We\u2019re trying everything. We looked at tape, trying to see where we can find more shots that are a little bit more in space, so everything\u2019s not so crowded in the paint. And we\u2019re looking at stuff. But, again, defensively we\u2019ve got to take a personal challenge, where it\u2019s everybody\u2019s gotta step up a little bit. Me, too, obviously. I\u2019m the anchor of the defense and I have to do a better job of communicating and putting urgency in guys. Me: Do you think the small ball trend around the league has hurt you personally, and this team defensively? MG: No, I think, obviously, the change that we\u2019ve been through the last couple of years. We had tremendous trust on the court. The guys knew exactly what their job was in every position. I knew the way Tony fought off a screen. I knew, like we were all connected in our minds, and our bodies were moving at the same time. It wasn\u2019t always pretty; it wasn\u2019t always perfect. But it was always connected. And I think, obviously, building that connection again takes some time. And you have to go through the same process over and over again. And I think we got kind of away from that a little bit. We got away from that and tried to build something too quickly, when the foundation of stuff, that connection wasn\u2019t there yet. Me: Everyone always connected Tony and Z-Bo with Memphis, almost more than you. But you\u2019ve been there longer than anyone, going back to high school. Do you think people maybe don\u2019t understand how much the city means to you? MG: Again, you can\u2019t control what other people think or what the perception is. I can only control the way I play. I\u2019ve got to do a better job with my body language when things aren\u2019t working out, instead of being deflated, more, more, more. That\u2019s what I can control and where my mind\u2019s at. Obviously I was a fan of the team at the Pyramid. Sidney Lowe was the head coach of the team, when Hubie (Brown) was the coach. It\u2019s been a while. Now, the Pyramid\u2019s a Bass Pro Shop. So things have changed down there. But I\u2019m living the ultimate fan dream, which is the team you cheer for and watch games, eventually you get to play for them. Life\u2019s good. \u2014 Steve Kerr ( @SteveKerr ), Tuesday, 10:32 p.m., expressing his obvious pleasure in the election of Democratic candidate Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate in Alabama, in an upset victory over Republican candidate Roy Moore \u2014 the first time a Democrat has won a Senate seat in that state since 1992. \u201cI like individuals, not so much on the organizations.

I suspect \u2018Melo believes (correctly) he\u2019ll get better shots playing with Russell Westbrook and Paul George on the floor than any of the Thunder\u2019s reserves, when opposing defenses would (correctly) double him every time he touched the ball and make someone else beat them, even if Billy Donovan staggered the minutes to make sure either Westbrook or George was on the floor with Anthony when\/if he came off the bench. I remember Michael Jordan\u2019s second year in Washington \u2014 his last as a player \u2014 in 2002-03. He\u2019d gotten hurt playing killer minutes the previous season, and everyone \u2014 including him \u2014 knew that he had to get his load down the following year. So everyone \u2014 including him \u2014 decided he\u2019d come off the bench as a sixth man. It made all the sense in the world. Jordan and Jerry Stackhouse didn\u2019t mesh together as starters. So the idea was to leave Stack in the starting lineup, where he\u2019d get the Wizards into the penalty with his slashing abilities, and then bring Jordan in to feast on second-level guys. It lasted exactly 15 games . Then Jordan was back in the starting lineup. It\u2019s just the nature of stars. Time to tame the Grizzlies? From Philip Joseph : Well, you can\u2019t ask a team for its best player and give them your third or fourth-best player, Phil. Memphis is going to ride Conley and Gasol for the foreseeable future, but if the Grizzlies were to talk trade with Denver, it would almost certainly have to include Harris or Jokic as part of a package for Conley \u2014 and the Nuggets, almost certainly, would pass. Keep your hands off my (insert naming rights deal winner here) Arena! From Ethan Austin : Always, always, always \u2014 any owner in any sport wants to own his or her building. While almost all of the revenues generated in that building for an NBA game are split in one way or another with the players, having an arena of one\u2019s own benefits an owner both in the short and long term. The primary reason: when one sells one\u2019s team, one gets a lot more cheddar if one sells the building in which one\u2019s team has played.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1)  James Harden (26.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 9 apg, .390 FG, .805 FT): I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d just let the franchise \u201cplay through\u201d knee pain . 2) LeBron James (24.8 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 13.5 apg, .522 FG, .778 FT): Tell Zem Nossink ! 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (29.7 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 4.3 apg, .531 FG, .704 FT): The Freak, in seven games this season against the NBA\u2019s top five teams (Houston, Boston, Cleveland, Golden State, San Antonio) that the Bucks have played so far: 33.6 points, 10 rebounds, 3.5 assists on 51.3 percent shooting. 4) Kevin Durant (32 ppg, 10 rpg, 6 apg, .591 FG, 1.000 FT):  By way of contrast , I will not be supplying my beloved American University Eagles with new swag before their Patriot League opener with Bucknell next week. 5) Kyrie Irving (28.7 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 6.3 apg, .492 FG, .941 FT): No word on whether the B52s were consulted before Kyrie wore another interesting pair of shoes in the second half last week against Denver. 455 \u2014 Career coaching victories for Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra, who passed Pat Riley as the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in victories Saturday in the Heat\u2019s win over the Clippers. 17 \u2014 Consecutive victories by the Thunder over the 76ers, a streak continued by last Friday\u2019s thrilling triple-overtime win by OKC in Philadelphia. The Sixers\u2019 last win over the Thunder came on Nov. 15, 2008. .573 \u2014 Field goal percentage of Mavs rookie Maxi Kleber, who has started the last 15 games at power forward for Dallas. The German import isn\u2019t setting the league on fire \u2014 7.3 points, 4.3 rebounds per game since becoming a starter \u2014 but the Mavs have won six of their last 15 with Kleber starting after beginning the year 2-13. 1)  The NBA has to do this . I don\u2019t care what the agents are saying behind the scenes; everyone else wants to see this, and see it live, and see the reactions of the guys who are picked last. That\u2019s life in the big city, where you get paid eight figures annually to play a kid\u2019s game. The players in the pool are already All-Stars. It\u2019s not like they won\u2019t get to play in the game. 2) Good luck to Monty McCutcheon, one of the league\u2019s best refs , in his new supervisory role in the league office overseeing and teaching referees in every NBA-affiliated league. He was at the Finals just about every year because he was that good, and he\u2019ll be missed. It is odd to take perhaps the NBA\u2019s best ref off active duty in the middle of a season. But it\u2019s also smart to put an active ref who knows and has worked with so many of the game\u2019s officials in recent years in Olympic Tower. 3) Since the Kings put Buddy Hield in a sixth-man role at the beginning of November, his numbers in 20 games through Friday: 12.6 points per game on 49.7 percent (96-193) shooting from the floor, including 54.9 percent (!) \u2014 45 of 82 \u2014 on threes. 4) Classy move by the Knicks Saturday , as Carmelo Anthony returned to Madison Square Garden . 1)  This is just horrible . But, if justice is finally coming to Lorenzen Wright and his family, let us get through all the horrible details and let him, at last, rest in peace. 2) Hoping for the best for Steve Clifford . His extended absence is troubling not only to the Hornets, but to everyone around the NBA. Hoping he finds the answers he needs to not just resume coaching, but live a life that works for him. 3) Rudy Gobert should just write off 2017 \u2014 the year, not the season. He\u2019ll be back on the court for the Jazz eventually. But the year has been a mess for him physically. Here\u2019s hoping 2018 brings him good health and extended playing time again. 4) \u201cThink of a domino that\u2019s 35 feet long, weighing about 600 pounds .\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one big domino.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Once again, what should have been an easy night for the Wizards turned into high drama, again at their own hands. Instead of John Wall, just back from PRP injections, and Bradley Beal resting in the fourth quarter, they had to again expend major energy down the stretch against a vastly inferior opponent. Washington blew a 15-point third quarter lead at home to the Clippers, down to the nubs of their roster with Blake Griffin and Danilo Gallinari and Patrick Beverley all out with injuries \u2014 but who had just beaten the Wizards a week earlier in Los Angeles. With five minutes of paying attention to detail, playing real defense and Wall making winning plays down the stretch, the Wizards pulled away . But that meant nothing. It should have been a 30-minute game for Washington\u2019s starters, not a 45-minute one. \u201cWe always show these lapses, when we play great defense and we can be a good team,\u201d Wall said. \u201cAnd then we play against certain teams or just don\u2019t show up certain days. If we want to be a team that gets past the second round, or even be a team that competes for a championship one day, we have to be able to do it consistently \u2014 every day in practice and in the games, and don\u2019t get bored with it.\u201d The Wizards aren\u2019t floundering \u2014 they were in fourth place in the topsy-turvy East before a Sunday loss to the Cavaliers dropped them down to eighth , not having yet played anything approaching their best basketball of the season. While Boston and Cleveland and Toronto have each had huge win streaks already, Washington\u2019s longest streak so far this season is four. But the Wizards are still displaying some of the maddening habits that have kept them from truly joining the conference\u2019s elite teams the last few seasons. \u201cSame team for three years,\u201d forward Markieff Morris said last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been (bleeping) around. But we\u2019re back. We\u2019ve got five back. We\u2019ve got Wall back. We\u2019re going to get it turned around.\u201d The Wizards are playing with an indifference for their opponents and a regular season boredom that they have not yet earned. Not when the current core has yet to get past the second round of the playoffs after three tries in four years, including last year\u2019s seventh-game loss to the Celtics in Boston . After each loss Washington has believed it was the better team, though it failed to prove it on the court. \u201cWe had a little bit of success last year,\u201d top reserve Kelly Oubre said, \u201cand we come back this year and we think we\u2019re already kind of hot. People humble us real quick, \u2018cause they give us our best game, and we act like it should just be given to us. We\u2019ve gotta learn, man.\u201d The numbers point to a team that plays up or down to its competition, something to which a veteran team like the Wizards should not be susceptible. Washington\u2019s beaten Detroit twice, split with the Raptors (including a win in Toronto without Wall) and Philadelphia, and won at Minnesota and Milwaukee. But the Wizards have inexplicably lost at home, where they were 30-11 last season, to lowly Dallas and Phoenix, the latter after leading by 21 points in the second quarter, as well as gagging a 20-point fourth-quarter lead in an insane loss to the TrailBlazers. They blew late leads against the Clippers and Lakers at Staples Center, and didn\u2019t execute down the stretch in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been dealing with for a while now, a couple of years,\u201d Beal said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a learning experience but we should definitely be past it now. It\u2019s something we should have down to the T by now. But we\u2019re still growing as a team. We have a lot of work to do.\u201d Injuries and the resulting inconsistency from them can explain some of what\u2019s dogged Washington \u2014 but only to a point. Last season, Washington\u2019s starters were third in the league in points per game at 82.2 , according to NBA.com\/Stats; only Golden State and Minnesota got more out of their first five. And the Wizards\u2019 starters were seventh in Offensive Rating . But this year, they\u2019ve been plagued so far by slow starts, especially in the third quarter. (Otto Porter hasn\u2019t been the problem; after getting a $104 million max offer sheet from Brooklyn that Washington matched last summer, the fifth-year forward is posting career highs in scoring, rebounds and assists, and is shooting 50 percent from the floor and 45 percent on threes.) Wall, again, was slow to get going, even though he was healthy in the summer for the first time in years. This time, he developed inflammation in his left knee after a collision during the Mavericks game Nov. 7, and soon after opted for the PRP and viscosupplementation injections. On a minutes restriction for now, he says he\u2019s come out of the first couple of games since his return without any pain or soreness. \u201cI feel great,\u201d he said. \u201cI just was fatigued. Drank a lot of water afterwards, \u2018cause my lips kept getting white \u2014 that means you\u2019re out of shape.\u201d Beal hasn\u2019t shot the ball as well as he did last year, and his 3-point attempts are down as teams load up on him. But he\u2019s become a much better ballhandler and playmaker, utilizing Marcin Gortat \u2014 still leading the league in screen assists per game at 33 \u2014 just as Wall does to get to the rim. It\u2019s a delicate balance Beal seeks, to become better and closer shots, but to still make defenses pay that suck in to stop Wall\u2019s drives with threes. Morris, who averaged 14 points and 6.5 rebounds last year, has struggled so far this season. He had sports hernia surgery in September, coinciding with a two-week trial in Phoenix with his twin brother Marcus; the brothers were acquitted of aggravated assault charges stemming from an incident in January, 2015 in which a man was beaten up outside a high school basketball game. Two other men pled guilty to assault charges in the case in September; another man was also acquitted of assault charges along with the Morris brothers. Markieff Morris says the inactivity during what would have been final preparations for training camp, along with missing camp itself as he healed from the surgery, set him back physically going into the season. He missed last week\u2019s game against Memphis with an ankle sprain and groin pull. \u201cFor it being my first time, I honestly didn\u2019t think it was going to be as tough as it was,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I think about it, (bleep), I am playing against the best players in the world, on a nightly basis. So that part was getting to me a little bit. This (bleep) ain\u2019t the same. But, now, I\u2019m starting to get better. (Wednesday) I ran on the treadmill. I was pretty cool. I wasn\u2019t winded. All the bumps and bruises and the nagging injuries, then coming back from the injury, all of that stuff played into it a little bit. I\u2019m just trying to stay healthy.\u201d There are reasons for optimism going forward, though. The terrible losses in L.A. notwithstanding, Washington has at least completed both of its West Coast trips already, with nothing outside the Central Time Zone the rest of the season, and only one prickly road trip \u2014 at Chicago, at Houston, at Cleveland, in early April \u2014 the rest of the regular season. The Wizards also still reside in the desultory Southeast Division; only Miami is currently within six games of Washington in the loss column, with Orlando fading quickly after a hot start, Charlotte riddled by injuries and Atlanta at the beginning of a rebuild. And while a division title no longer offers top-four seed playoff protection, beating up on their division foes would pad the Wizards\u2019 record. And, after last season, when Brooks had little faith in his reserves, and the Wizards had to cough up a 2018 first-round pick to Brooklyn to get the ill-conceived contract of Andrew Nicholson off their books, the Wizards again rebuilt their bench \u2014 this time, at least so far, with better results. Oubre ping-pongs between the starting lineup when either Porter or Morris have been out, but he\u2019s been very good in reserve, getting on the glass (5.3 rebounds per game in 26 minutes) and improving his shot (37 percent on threes). Veteran Tim Frazier has been solid if unspectacular backing up Wall; the Wizards didn\u2019t implode (5-6) with Wall out of the lineup, and also got a boost from combo guard Tomas Satoransky, who looks much more comfortable on the floor in his second NBA season. Jodie Meeks is shooting a career-worst 29.9 percent on threes so far, but he still requires defenses\u2019 attention when he\u2019s on the floor. Washington\u2019s best bench player, though, has been veteran forward Mike Scott, signed in September after a tryout. Frankly, the 29-year-old Scott didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go after his four-plus years stint in Atlanta\u2019s rotation came to an end last season; the Hawks traded him to Phoenix in February, and the Suns promptly cut him. \u201cThe opportunity in Atlanta, it was over,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was time. I don\u2019t have any hard feelings. I think I sucked.\u201d He sucked, in part, because he had ballooned up to 268 pounds in his last year there. Hanging over his head at the time were felony charges stemming from a July 2015 arrest of Scott and his brother by Georgia police. At the time, police said they found marijuana and the drug MDMA in the car in which the Scott brothers were driving. But in May of this year, a judge ruled that the brothers were subjected to racial profiling, which led police to stop their car, and that there was no probable cause that would have otherwise led police to the car. (The police officer who arrested Scott had a history of targeting people of color in his arrest record, and was subsequently fired by his department .) Scott stayed in Atlanta last summer, shedding the pounds with personal trainer Ray Grayson \u2014 aka, Mr. \u201cShut Up and Train\u201d \u2014 and basketball coach Mark Edwards, who got 30 pounds off his frame, worked on his handle and helped him get his head straight \u2014 he had, in his words, \u201csulked\u201d after the trade and being unable to catch on elsewhere. \u201cIt was three months of just hard work, twice a day, five days a week, sometimes six days a week,\u201d Scott said. \u201c\u2026The sulking came from not knowing what was going to happen off the court. That was the most part. I\u2019m just very grateful I got a second chance. This organization gave me another opportunity. I\u2019m very grateful. It\u2019s why I got out there and play, no matter how good I play or how bad I play, I\u2019m just grateful. I could have been out (of) the league.\u201d Scott has come back with a flourish, averaging almost nine points a game off the bench in 18.5 minutes, shooting a ridiculous and almost certainly unsustainable 57.2 percent from the floor, including 42.3 percent on threes. He\u2019s scoring in the post, he\u2019s scoring in transition and he\u2019s scoring behind the arc. And with Ian Mahinmi much more active and effective as a defensive anchor, the Wizards\u2019 bench is more than four points better in Defensive Rating (103.5) than it was last season, when it was a sieve that blew leads the starters had created. Now, the opposite is often true: the bench has gotten back deficits left by the starters. And one can\u2019t help but think the Wizards may be holding some small ball lineups in abeyance, not wanting opponents to see too much too early. They showed one version off Sunday against Cleveland, with Morris playing the five in the fourth quarter ahead of Gortat, with Scott at the four and Oubre at the three (Porter missed the game with a hip injury). \u201cMe and Mike at the five, Kelly at the four, I think so,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThat\u2019s the league now. When it\u2019s needed, I think we match up with the best teams playing small ball. We go over it a lot. We practice it a lot. And I think it\u2019ll be successful for us down the road. We\u2019re not showing it a lot. We\u2019re showing a little at a time.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

(AP) \u2014 The ex-wife of former NBA player Lorenzen Wright has been charged in his slaying, more than seven years after his body was found in a field in his hometown of Memphis. Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings said Saturday that Sherra Wright has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Lorenzen Wright, who played for five teams over 13 seasons as a forward and center in the NBA. Police and federal marshals in Riverside County, California, arrested 46-year-old Sherra Wright on Friday night on a fugitive from justice warrant, online records show. Wright\u2019s decomposing body was found in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010 \u2013 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases. The case had a break earlier this month, when Billy R. Turner was indicted on a first-degree murder charge Dec. 5 in Wright\u2019s death. Turner has pleaded not guilty. Media reports have said Turner, a landscaper, and Sherra Wright attended the same church. Rallings would not discuss the connection between Turner and Wright, but he said police were confident they knew each other. A release from the Shelby County District Attorney\u2019s office says Turner and Sherra Wright conspired to kill Lorenzen Wright. Sherra Wright has a court hearing Monday in California. Officials were not certain Saturday when she would be returned to Memphis. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. \u201cThe weapon was key,\u201d Rallings said. The District Attorney\u2019s office said the first attempt at killing Wright occurred between April and July 2010 and involved Turner traveling to Wright\u2019s home near Atlanta. The indictment says Sherra Wright and Turner acquired firearms and recruited a co-conspirator, who was not named. Rallings said police are looking at other people in the investigation. Sherra Wright received $1 million from her ex-husband\u2019s life insurance policy. She agreed to a settlement in 2014 in a court dispute over how she spent the insurance money meant to benefit their six children, The Commercial Appeal has reported. Born and raised in Memphis, Lorenzen Wright was a fan favorite thanks to his charity work with youth and his father\u2019s involvement as a coach in summer leagues. Former NBA players and friends including Anfernee Hardaway and Elliot Perry attended a memorial service for Wright in the days after his body was found. Sherra Wright spoke with police after her ex-husband\u2019s body was found. According to an affidavit, Sherra Wright told police she saw him leave her home carrying money and a box of drugs on July 18, 2010. Before he left, Sherra Wright said she overheard her ex-husband on the telephone telling someone that he was going to \u201cflip something for $110,000,\u201d the document said. Sherra Wright said Lorenzen Wright left in a car with a person she could not identify. The affidavit said Sherra Wright gave the statements to police in the Memphis suburb of Collierville, where she lives, on July 27 \u2013 nine days after he left her house for the last time. In the early morning of July 19, a police dispatcher in the suburb of Germantown received a call from Wright\u2019s cellphone. Dispatchers acknowledged they heard noises like gunshots before the call was dropped. Dispatchers said they didn\u2019t alert patrol officers or commanders because they couldn\u2019t confirm it came from their jurisdiction. They didn\u2019t send a patrol officer or relay the information to Memphis police until days later. Wright\u2019s mother filed a missing-person report with Collierville police on July 22, 2010. Authorities in Collierville were accused of dragging their feet in the days after the report was filed, and an apparent lack of communication kept authorities from linking the 911 call to the missing-person report. Wright\u2019s body was found in a field near some woods in the height of summer, complicating the investigation because evidence had likely deteriorated in the heat. An autopsy report showed bullet fragments were lodged in Wright\u2019s skull, chest and right forearm."},{"id":42756,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kentavious-caldwell-pope-missed-due-travel-restrictions","date":"2017-12-16","title":"Los Angeles Lakers Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed game because of travel restrictions","content":"EL SEGUNDO, Calif.

Those are just a few benefits of getting older. On Dec. 8, the club added an eight-time All-Star who has been putting up stellar numbers in the Queen City \u2014 arguably his best stats since the 2013-14 season. Meanwhile, the King maintains a firm grip over his kingdom while a hoodie in OKC continues a free fall. Notes: Season statistics are through games of Dec. 14 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 28.3 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 11.0 apg Season stats: 28.1 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 9.1 apg Another two-week stint, another three games with 30 or more points. Wait. We said that last time. Well, it rings true yet again. In fact, James\u2019 lowest scoring output was 23 points. He also ripped off three straight games of 12 or more assists, including tying a career high with 17 in Tuesday\u2019s victory over the Hawks. There\u2019s no slowing the King. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 21.2 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 1.7 apg Season stats: 22.7 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 2.1 apg Aldridge has gone for 20 or more points in three consecutive games and six of his last eight. In fact, his 22.7 points this season is his highest mark since 2014-15 when he averaged 23.4 with the Trail Blazers. It will be interesting to see the effect Kawhi Leonard\u2019s return will have on Aldridge\u2019s offensive stats. 3. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 19.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 3.5 apg Season stats: 18.9 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.0 apg It was a consistent and yet unspectacular (for the most part) two-week stint for Gasol, who went for 15 or more points in all eight games but only broke 25 in one game (27 last Saturday against the Cavaliers). We\u2019ve also taken notice of the slip in shooting, eclipsing 50 percent from the field in just one of his last 14 games. 4. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 23.2 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 8.6 apg Season stats: 16.2 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 9.6 apg Paul has found his groove, shooting 51.9 from the field, 44.1 from beyond the arc, 2.4 steals and 20 or more points in three straight. He\u2019s also managed to go over 10 assists in five of the last nine \u2014 a big reason the Rockets have won a season-high 11 straight. On top of that, Paul is hitting 3-pointers at a career-best 41.8. 5. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 23.8 ppg, 14.3 rpg, 1.0 apg Season stats: 16.4 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.2 apg Welcome to the club, big fella. Since Howard turned 32 on Dec. 8, he only has four games under his belt. But those four were certainly good enough for inclusion, going for 20 or more points and at least two blocks in all four. Also, in two of those games, Howard grabbed 18 or more rebounds while shooting better than 60 percent. 6. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 21.6 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 2.9 apg Season stats: 15.2 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.2 apg It was a blast from the past last Friday, as Randolph turned in one of his typical Z-Bo type games from years ago (35 points and 13 rebounds). Randolph, who has shot better than 50 percent in seven of the last eight games, is shooting 51.2 \u2014 his highest mark since \u201902-03 (51.3). And with 21 3s, he\u2019s on pace to shatter his career high of 25. 7. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 10 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 21.8 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 3.2 apg Season stats: 17.0 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 3.5 apg Redick, who will most likely be a bit of a roller-coaster ride all season, is in the midst of his best scoring spree, notching at least 15 points in seven straight while going for 25 or more in three of those games. He\u2019s also hit three or more 3-pointers in three straight and five of the last seven. This is probably as close as he\u2019ll be to being locked in. 8. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 12.0 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 11.1 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 1.5 apg Uh oh. Did we jinx Gibson by touting him so much? After stringing together three straight double-doubles, he\u2019s managed just two in the last seven games. As has been the case all season, Gibson plays better win the Timberwolves win. In four wins, he averaged 13.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 58.8 FG%. In three losses, Gibson averaged 10 points, seven rebounds and 38.5 FG%. 9. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 12.4 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 17.7 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 1.5 apg It\u2019s like the popular Paul Simon song goes: \u201cSlip Slidin\u2019 Away.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s happening with Anthony, who can\u2019t seem to snap out of his season-long slump, shooting 34.3 FG%, 24.1 3PT% and 55.6 FT% over the last two weeks. Yes, he did score 21 last Saturday against Memphis, but it took him 20 shots (7-for-20) to get there. 10. Courtney Lee (32), New York Knicks Previous rank: 7 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 15.1 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 2.1 apg Season stats: 13.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.8 apg Three good, three bad and one mediocre. That\u2019s how we summarize Lee\u2019s last seven games. In fact, if not for Thursday\u2019s 27-point performance, Lee may have been bumped off the list. After securing nine straight games of 50 percent or better from the field, Lee has bettered that threshold just once in the last four games. Just missed the cut: J.J. Barea, Marcin Gortat, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade Will turn 32 this season: Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Three months after the Knicks traded Anthony to Oklahoma City , their former All-Star is gone and quickly forgotten. Porzingis is playing nearly as well as Anthony ever did in New York and seems to enjoy unyielding support from both fans and the front office that Anthony never had. Porzingis has something else Anthony doesn\u2019t: a winning record.The Knicks welcome Anthony back on Saturday, trying to extend their surprising start though perhaps without the new main man in Madison Square Garden. Anthony said after a triple-overtime victory in Philadelphia on Friday that he expected a fun night in New York. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be an appreciation. It\u2019s not like I was there for a year or a season or two seasons. I spent a lot of time there, almost seven years there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was great times, there was bad times. Regardless, I always stuck with it. I always remained professional. I always came and did my job whether people liked that or not. Hopefully people recognize that.\u201d Unlike team management, Porzingis didn\u2019t want his friend to leave. But it sure looks like it was the best thing for him and the Knicks. \u201cWell obviously, I would love to have had him here to continue to learn from him,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cBut without him this year I\u2019ve had more of an opportunity. I am featured more, which is normal.\u201d Porzingis is listed as questionable to play after he left the Knicks\u2019 game in Brooklyn on Thursday in the third quarter with a sore left knee. New York held on after he left, improving to 15-13 with its third straight victory. If Porzingis plays, count on the usual raucous ovation when he\u2019s the final starter announced, the spot that previously belonged to Anthony. And what of the reception for Anthony, who led the Knicks to three straight playoff appearances after arriving in 2011, led the league in scoring when they won 54 games and a division championship in 2013, and always made it clear that he loved New York and didn\u2019t want to go? \u201cI don\u2019t think he deserves to be booed, but you never know,\u201d Knicks forward Lance Thomas said. \u201cRegardless, he is going to bring his `A\u2019 game and we\u2019re going to bring ours as well.\u201d Former team president Phil Jackson longed to unload Anthony last season, but the Knicks weren\u2019t sure what to expect when they finally did make a deal on the eve of training camp. He was their leading scorer and team leader, and coach Jeff Hornacek had already said Anthony would be in the starting lineup if he remained on the team. But new president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry found a trade the next day and it\u2019s been a good one for the Knicks. Enes Kanter is giving them 13.4 points and 10.3 rebounds a game as the starting center while providing positivity that for years rarely existed in the home locker room. Doug McDermott is bringing another 8.5 points a night off the bench. Anthony is struggling right along with the Thunder, a top-25 scorer in NBA history potentially on his way to the worst season of his career. He went into Friday\u2019s game averaging just 17.7 points on 40 percent shooting before scoring 24 points. And after placing him with MVP Russell Westbrook and fellow All-Star Paul George for the NBA\u2019s latest Big Three, the Thunder were under .500 before Friday\u2019s victory. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that to be honest,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut regardless, (they) will figure it out. I am not worried about them. I am worried about the Knicks.\u201d There\u2019s less reason to worry than in Anthony\u2019s final years in New York. Jackson alternated between trying to win and trying to rebuild seemingly every season, and his insistence on running the triangle offense appeared out of touch in an era when NBA teams are pushing the pace. And his stance toward Anthony last season angered teammates who appreciated the veteran\u2019s efforts on and off the court. Mills and Perry took aim at the culture and signaled a desire to build behind Porzingis, whose average of 25.5 points would be even higher if not for a sprained ankle that forced him to leave one game after 2 1\/2 minutes. He looks happy after he was so disillusioned by the atmosphere under Jackson that he blew off his exit meeting last spring. And while the Knicks appear on the rise, Anthony is trying to keep the Thunder from getting down. \u201cFor the most part what I like about it, guys are trying to figure it out,\u201d he said earlier this week. \u201cGuys are trying to make it work.

Hayward was at TD Garden for Boston\u2019s matchup with the Utah Jazz, the team he left this past summer in free agency after seven seasons to sign a four-year, $128 million contract with the Celtics. He was injured in Boston\u2019s season opener at Cleveland. \u201cMy mind is open to that,\u201d Hayward said of the possibility of returning to game action before season\u2019s end. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get back as fast as I can.

Probably a little while longer.\u201d Hayward said the plan was always to begin attending games regularly once he got out of the walking boot and into the brace.

He had dinner with former Jazz teammate Joe Ingles on Thursday and planned to check in with his former teammates and coaches before they left Boston. Jazz coach Quin Snyder said there are no sour feelings about Hayward\u2019s decision to leave in free agency. \u201cI think everybody understands the decision that he made,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cSo to see him get hurt, it was hard. I felt horrible for him. I think most of the guys on our team reached out. I know I did. I think he was appreciative of that. At this point we wish him well in his rehab. We hope that he\u2019s back soon. At the same time our group has moved on, too.\u201d Hayward said he remains secure in his decision to leave the team that originally drafted him 2010. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t regret anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI unfortunately got injured, but happy to be here in Boston and happy to be a part of this team.\u201d He said coach Brad Stevens\u2019 approach of trying to get better daily in all things basketball related has helped him in his rehab process. \u201cHe set the tone with that in college,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting better each day. The same thing for me. I\u2019m trying to be better than I was yesterday. It\u2019s a long process. It\u2019s a grind. It\u2019s pretty tough to do every day. But that\u2019s my job right now.

"},{"id":42774,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/p3-has-become-gold-standard-technology-and-sports-players-looking-edge","date":"2017-12-15","title":"Peak Performance Project helping Atlanta Hawks raise the bar in training facilities","content":" ATLANTA \u2014 The pregnant check written by Hawks owner Tony Ressler for the team\u2019s glossy new 90,000 square foot training center didn\u2019t concern him as much as the more numerous, smaller ones. As in: Double practice courts? Check. Outdoor swimming pool? Check. Grilling area and on-site gourmet chefs? Check. Video game consoles and a fleet of flat-screen TVs? Check and double check. Still, Ressler and the folks at Emory Healthcare, which teamed with the Hawks to blueprint the place, wanted more for the $50 million. And so they checked off another amenity: An East Coast hub of a California sports science lab that developed a cult following among a number of players and over half the league\u2019s teams. Peak Performance Project carted computers, high-tech gadgets and cutting edge fitness equipment from its Santa Barbara headquarters to set up shop in Atlanta. The company, or P3, helped the Hawks raise the bar in what\u2019s become a practice facility building boom in the NBA, where the Bulls , Sixers , Nets , Kings and Raptors all recently moved into or building swanky centers that could double as country clubs.  Yes, the gourmet meals, hydrotherapy pools and theater seating is quite a refreshing change from the prehistoric places in which teams trained before. The Hawks\u2019 old setup was inside Philips Arena, where ironically players had to climb stairs to reach the Stairmaster machines and had the disadvantage of only one practice court. Perhaps the Ground Zero of practice centers, however, was used by the Nets some 20 years ago in New Jersey. They shared a gym, weight room and a locker room with pot-bellied drivers from the owner\u2019s trucking company. Yes, Derrick Coleman sometimes showered next to Fred from Bayonne. Not only have facilities come a long way \u2014 the Nets now train on the Brooklyn waterfront with a panoramic view of Lower Manhattan \u2014 so has sports science and how it\u2019s being embraced as a necessary part of the game. Ten years ago nobody in the NBA had their bodies poked by scientists or \u2018scoped by modern technology to learn more about the way those bodies function. Then P3 came along and quickly became the gold standard of technology and sports and a go-to place in the offseason for players looking for an edge. If the NBA All-Star Game draws the biggest collection of talent around the league during the year, then an athletic science lab in Santa Barbara might be next. Damian Lillard, Karl-Anthony Towns, Rudy Gobert, Zach LaVine, Andre Drummond and Kyle Korver are just some of those seduced by science. P3 collects data through assessments of a player\u2019s body and his high velocity movements to identify his physical strengths and weaknesses, raise red flags for areas that could be prone to potential injury, and give him and his team information to help improve performance. There\u2019s also training sessions designed to prevent injuries and enhance the muscles and movements needed to reach potential, an elite athlete optimization that\u2019s suddenly vital to careers. \u201cWe want to uncover the hidden code of sport,\u201d said P3\u2019s founder, Dr. Marcus Elliott. \u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from having all the answers but we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d It was just several years ago when the NBA suffered a rash of injuries, especially to star players, and that plague became a threat to business. In no particular sequence, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Deron Williams and other All-Stars missed chunks of seasons dealing with tears and breaks. The company has developed strong ties with the league and now has set up shop at the draft combine to assess every rookie who attends. On the suggestion of their teams or their agents, veterans make summer trips to Santa Barbara, and now there\u2019s another location. The relationship is win-win for the Hawks and P3, because the Hawks can use the advantages of their facility with P3 to showcase to potential free agents, and P3 has a second site to broaden its scope not only within the NBA, but with athletes in other pro sports and colleges in the East and also those from Europe. It wasn\u2019t an easy sell for the Hawks, though. Elliott initially resisted the invitation, a few times in fact, in favor of staying housed a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. But it was important for the Hawks to merge basketball with orthopedic and science experts to maximize the potential of their players. So they persisted, Elliott caved after weighing the benefits of a second location and is happy he did. \u201cWe have as many athletes on the East Coast as the West Coast,\u201d he said, \u201cand Atlanta\u2019s a lot easier to reach.\u201d Elliott is a graduate of the Harvard Medical School and always curious about athletes and how their bodies function. He formed P3 in 2005, worked with the New England Patriots, then gravitated to the NBA when Paul Millsap sought his help and then served as an ambassador. \u201cHe did really well and told two people and we got five guys in and they told two people and then you\u2019ve got 20 guys in,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cPro sports is a small world. If you do well, then everybody knows about it. Of course, if you screw up, everybody knows about it, too.\u201d Millsap told Korver, who first met Elliott in 2008 and credited P3 with helping him shake nagging injuries and remain in the league well into his 30s. P3 collected more than 5,000 data points on his body and discovered he wasn\u2019t properly using his right knee and elbow, both of which previously underwent surgery, to his advantage.  \u201cTheir assessments and the data they collect are so valuable to helping you understand what needs to be done,\u201d said Korver. \u201cNo question it was so important for my career.\u201d In a section of the Hawks facility used exclusively for P3, there\u2019s a straight running track, some free weights, and hi-tech treadmills. It looks simple, and in a sense, it is, although the science and technology sets it apart and makes it unique. The center can test and train 12 to 15 athletes at a time over a two-hour period. Thousands of athletes from various Olympic, amateur and pro sports have been through the doors in Santa Barbara. No athlete can train without an assessment first. Once the data is received, then a workout conducted by bio-mechanists and performance specialists and tailored specifically for that athlete, based on the results. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all philosophy at P3. \u201cIt\u2019s all individualized,\u201d said Adam Hewitt, the director of operations at P3. \u201cAll bodies are different. You can have two guys the same size and have completely different systems. One might have flexibility in his lower, but the other doesn\u2019t. Our thought is, how do we make the athlete better using this technology?\u201d Hewitt said this process is light years ahead of what athletes and teams did just a few years ago, mainly because science and technology is evolving and P3 is trying to stay ahead of the curve. \u201cOthers aren\u2019t using bio-technology to assess their athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re showing the value that we can offer. We\u2019ve invested so much and for so long.\u201d P3 looks at the bodies in motion with the help of motion-capture technology similar to those used in video games. The images and information allow P3 to craft workouts to strengthen limbs and also to avoid injury. Just as NBA teams have spent millions building new practice facilities and hiring nutritionists and massage therapists, Elliott thinks it\u2019s wise they make an investment in science. \u201cThere\u2019s a revolution going on in sports science and athlete care,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was overdue in professional sports. Your average sprinter or speed skater has more science data in his physical development and he\u2019s working a part time job at a restaurant to make ends meet. He has more resources going for him than someone you\u2019re paying $20 million a year. That made no sense to me. Contracts are too big and players are too important to take anything to chance. There\u2019s a lot to lose. Even if you don\u2019t understand it all, why wouldn\u2019t you at least want the information on the table? If you don\u2019t have all the information then is hard to play the probability game. You\u2019re making bets on big contracts and on players being able to perform and stay healthy.\u201d The use of force plates to measure explosiveness while jumping is of great use for NBA players and why P3 has growing influence on most of the league. \u201cThe NBA is leading our pro sports leagues,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cAs a league, they should be proud. The other leagues are trying to copy them. The NFL is trying to catch up, baseball, hockey, teams are starting to hire smarter people and investing more in their performance sports science staffs. A lot has changed. I feel the biggest thing is we\u2019ve been so invested in getting insight into the data. \u201cThere\u2019s people in academics asking questions, and people in sport are trying to do the best they can. Rarely do they come together. Our motto is bringing these together. It\u2019s super exciting to see. At the risk of sounding pompous I\u2019d say I\u2019m proud of it. I know the NBA is happy because they can see the bar\u2019s being raised.\u201d The P3 in Atlanta will operate same as usual, with no advertising, just word of mouth and a growing number of clients. The lab anticipates helping NBA players improve their ankle and hip mobility and put them in better position to succeed through science. \u201cIt\u2019s about turning it back to advantages to the athlete,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThese guys are super unique.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

You remember that look in his eye on Draft night 2013, when the Magic made him the No. 2 overall pick and the hopes of a city and franchise were planted firmly on the shoulders of the dynamic shooting guard from Indiana. Well, Oladipo has that look again \u2026 five years, two teams and plenty of trials and tribulations later, he\u2019s finally back to his plan. He\u2019s doing it on familiar ground, too, back in Indiana with the Pacers and in the middle of a surprising rebuild the franchise kicked into high gear over the summer, when they traded All-Star and face of the franchise Paul George to Oklahoma City for Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis . It was a deal that signaled yet another shift in Oladipo\u2019s career. After three decent seasons in Orlando, he was traded to the Thunder where he took up residence as Russell Westbrook\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 only to have that experiment never really take off the way anyone expected. * Aschburner:  Oladipo helping Pacers move on from George But that\u2019s all history now for Oladipo, whose NBA existence came full circle this week with him earning his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week award just in time for George\u2019s first game back at Bankers Life Fieldhouse Wednesday in a Thunder uniform to matchup with the new face of the franchise. Oladipo was fresh off of a career-high 47-point night in a Sunday win over Denver , which came two days after he smoked LeBron James and Cleveland for 33 points, eight rebounds and five assists to help the Pacers end the Cavaliers\u2019 win streak at 13 games. The Pacers couldn\u2019t finish it off right, though, falling 100-95 in a supercharged atmosphere to a Thunder team desperate to turn their season around. Oladipo finished 9-for-26 from the floor (19 points), the loss spoiling what had the makings of a huge party had they won, what with the the Pacers announcing that they\u2019ll host the 2021 NBA All-Star Game before Wednesday night\u2019s opening tip. \u201cWe might have wanted it, too bad,\u201d Oladipo told reporters from a seat in front of his locker after the game. \u201cMaybe, in that aspect \u2026 I\u2019m not sure about the moment getting to us. We got a little too antsy. I think I was moving way too fast out there at times, didn\u2019t do a good job of changing up my speeds and stuff like that. Sometimes you can get a little overhyped. That might have trickled in. But it\u2019s a learning experience for us.\u201d Oladipo\u2019s story should be a learning experience, too, a lesson for anyone who refuses to believe in the power of patience. He\u2019s living proof that it\u2019s never too late to find the right fit, to chase the elite destiny you believed was in you. People wrote him off when he struggled to find his rhythm playing alongside Westbrook. Even more did when the Thunder traded him to the Pacers. Cleary, he never stopped believing. He\u2019s posting career-bests across the board \u2014 points (24.3), rebounds (5.3), assists (4.1), steals (1.9), blocks (1.0), field goal percentage (.478) and 3-point percentage (.426) \u2014 and should be included in any conversation about the Kia Most Improved Player award. \u201cVic is the face of Indiana.Vic is the future,\u201d George said after the game, trying to put his seven years with the Pacers in the proper context and allow everyone to move on to the Oladipo era. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be great here. He\u2019s blessed. He\u2019s talented. He\u2019s what you want in a guy for a franchise.\u201d Oladipo also makes his debut on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, coming in at No. 9, and goes into tonight\u2019s matchup against Central Division rival Detroit ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ) with a fresh perspective after being locked in an individual battle with George Wednesday night. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve had a defender guard me like that since I\u2019ve been on this team,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for what the Thunder threw at me. I guarantee I\u2019ll be ready next time.\u201d Lessons learned for all involved. * * * The top five in the Week 9 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.6 points, 9.4 assists, 5.1 rebounds What Harden and Chris Paul are doing in Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system defies logic. You knew they had a chance to be next-level good with two of the league\u2019s best playmakers sharing a backcourt. The fact that D\u2019Antoni can have one or both of them on the floor basically at all times , the way he did in Wednesday\u2019s win over Charlotte , is what makes the Rockets so difficult to defend. Harden was great, as always (21 points, eight assists and four rebounds). But Paul was spectacular (season-high 31 points, 11 assists, seven rebounds). Most of us assumed there\u2019d be some growing pains, some sort of transition period that would give the Rockers at least a few moments of pause. Not with these two brilliant floor leaders at the controls. Harden and the Rockets take their 11-game win streak into tonight\u2019s test ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) against a Spurs team that ended their season in the playoffs last season. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  28.2 points, 9.0 assists, 8.2 rebounds The young Los Angeles Lakers didn\u2019t have time for hero worship. Not with the player they grew up idolizing stalking them in the flesh Thursday night at Quicken Loans Arena. LeBron dished out some licks and lessons, tying Larry Bird for sixth on the all-time triple-double list with 59. The Cavaliers needed his 25 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists and two blocks to fend off Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and the crew . It\u2019s been a good week for LeBron, who matched his career-high in assists (17) in Tuesday\u2019s win over the Atlanta Hawks. The turnaround for the Cavaliers has been spectacular. They\u2019ve won 16 of their last 17 games after that 5-7 start, and they\u2019ve done it following LeBron\u2019s lead. He\u2019s averaging a triple-double (28.2 points on .553 shooting, 11.8 assists and 10.6 rebounds) in his last five games, showing no signs of slowing down as his 33rd birthday approaches. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  24.0 points, 4.9 assists, 3.0 rebounds Kyrie delivered his eighth 30-point effort of the season in Wednesday\u2019s home win over the Denver Nuggets , a game the Celtics played without Al Horford. Kyrie\u2019s ability to raise his level of play every time the Celtics need it is what has made his season special. In Cleveland, he was always operating the in the vast shadow cast by LeBron James. And when the Cavaliers struggled without LeBron in the lineup, there was plenty of finger pointing at the young point guard. He doesn\u2019t have that cloud hanging over him anymore and it\u2019s a freedom that clearly agrees with him. His 33 points (on 12-for-19 shooting, 4-for-9 from deep), seven assists and two blocks helped fuel the Celtics to a season-high 124 points. Kyrie\u2019s shooting from the floor (49.7 percent) is a career-best and he\u2019s shooting 40 percent or better from 3-point range for the second straight season (and just the third time in his career). Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, 5.1 assists Durant continues to shine \u2026 no matter who the Warriors have in the lineup alongside him. He powered the Warriors to their eighth straight win after notching 36 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists against the Dallas Mavericks . The Warriors were missing three starters (Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia) as well as reserve shooting guard Nick Young. That didn\u2019t help the Mavericks, who couldn\u2019t contain Durant in any capacity. Getting this kind of work out of Durant with Curry out of the lineup benefits the Warriors the same way seeing Curry operate when Durant was out of the lineup for a long stretch last season recovering from a knee injury. Coach Steve Kerr gets a chance to tinker with all the different lineups around Durant that he wouldn\u2019t normally see with a fully healthy roster. Durant\u2019s averaging 30.8 points, 9.6 rebound, 6.8 assists and 2.6 blocks in the Warriors\u2019 last five games. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  29.9 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists Watching Antetokounmpo work against a wide array of defenders in a given week has turned into one of the more entertaining study sessions in the pre-Christmas portion of this season. His continuous adjustments from night to night have been tremendous. He\u2019s currently working on a streak of 17 straight games where he\u2019s scored 20 or more points and he\u2019s scored 32 or more in four of his last six outings. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable roll for a player who does so much more than just score, not to mention one who barely shoots from beyond the 3-point line and doesn\u2019t camp out around the basket to get his buckets. It\u2019s also a testament to the work Giannis has put in on his dribble-drive game, though it helps that he has the length and athleticism to finish around, above or through any individual defender a team might use to try to stop him. And don\u2019t underestimate Eric Bledsoe\u2019s impact on Giannis and on the Bucks overall. The next five: 6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 7. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 8. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 9. Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers 10. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans And five more \u2026: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder An inside look at Kevin Love from an Eastern Conference scout: \u201cLet\u2019s get this out of the way first, right now, Kevin Love is an absolute lock Eastern Conference All-Star this season. A runaway pick. And that\u2019s not something a lot of people would have said about him last season or even the season before. A lot of people got down on his talent, felt like he\u2019d gotten exposed a bit and maybe wasn\u2019t ever going to get back a truly elite level. He\u2019s so much more comfortable in his role on that [Cleveland] team right now that it\u2019s scary. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t realize just how tough it might have been for him to get in a groove when LeBron and Kyrie were on that roster. Love wasn\u2019t getting the ball in certain situations and in the sweet spots where he could do his best work. No one had ever doubted his talent. We all saw what he could do individually in Minnesota. He could have piled up those 26 (points) and 15 (rebounds) nights forever on a bad team. All of the different ways that Tyronn Lue can use him now, ways he couldn\u2019t when you had Kyrie as your second option, and sometimes your first, are available now. \u201cKevin is such a great passer and rebounder that you get to see the value of his entire game now. You can play him in the high pick-and-roll or you can allow him to post out on the wing and face up and work outside in and it\u2019s a pick your poison situation, because he\u2019s such a good shooter all the way out to and beyond the 3-point line. There are just so many ways you can exploit some of those mismatches when he\u2019s your second option and not just an afterthought. The key is going to be finding a way to keep Kevin locked in like this when Isaiah Thomas comes back. That\u2019s where that coaching staff is going to earn their keep. Because Love is back where you want him to be.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

LeBron James recorded his 59th career triple-double in front of Ball and his brothers, Kevin Love scored 28 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers won for the 16th time in 17 games, 121-112 over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. James finished with 25 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists to move into a tie with Larry Bird for sixth place on the career triple-doubles list. James also put the Lakers away in the final minutes with a dunk and short runner, leading Cleveland to its 10th straight home win. For Ball, his first on-court encounter with James was eye-opening. \u201cWatching him doesn\u2019t do him justice,\u201d Ball said. \u201cHe has that size, that speed. I\u2019d say he\u2019s the best player in the world right now.\u201d James, who has been complimentary of the 20-year-old Ball in the past, met with the Lakers highly touted rookie on the floor following the game. As cameras recorded the moment, James and Ball, whose all-around games and backgrounds are very similar, covered their mouths so the world couldn\u2019t listen in on their conversation. James said he was humbled to learn the former UCLA star patterned his game after him. James has become a fan of Ball\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s always team,\u201d James said when asked what he admires most about Ball. \u201cHe passes the ball. Pushes the ball up the floor. Someone you want to play with. This is a team game. Everyone gets so caught up in this whole individual thing and it\u2019s, the whole team game gets overlooked, but then, I\u2019m not going to go there.\u201d Love scored 13 in the third quarter, when the Cavs opened an 11-point lead. Jose Calderon added a season-high 17 points for Cleveland. Brandon Ingram scored 26 for the Lakers and Ball had 13 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. The first game between James and Ball had the buildup of a playoff game as the world\u2019s best player matched up against a budding star. Ball\u2019s father, LaVar, did not attend the game but his brothers, LiAngelo and LaMelo, sat behind L.A\u2019s bench. LaVar Ball launched his \u201cBig Baller Brand\u201d to promote his three talented sons. James gave the family a lesson in the business of basketball. Of course, James\u2019 impending free agency has led to speculation he may sign with the Lakers. Because of his connections to Los Angeles (he owns a film production company, and recently bought another home there) and some Twitter posts he\u2019s made about Ball, the Lakers are believed to be a potential landing spot for the three-time NBA champion, who scoffed at the conjecture about his future or his relationship with Ball. \u201cI see all the stupid noise that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t buy a home in L.A., I can\u2019t live in L.A. It\u2019s funny noise. But I don\u2019t get involved in it. When I post things I don\u2019t look at comments because I\u2019m so far removed from the white noise and the noise doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d"},{"id":42773,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/shaqtin-fool-2017-18-episode-7","date":"2017-12-15","title":"Shaqtin' A Fool 2017-18: Episode 7","content":"Vote now for the Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool play of the week!

At 22-6, they\u2019re on pace for 64 wins, which would be their lowest total in four seasons under head coach Steve Kerr. But the Warriors have won seven straight games , despite the absence of their most important offensive player (Stephen Curry) for each of the last three and the absence of their most important defensive player (Draymond Green) for two of the last three. They went 6-0 on their longest road trip of the season, and took took care of business (without three starters) back at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday. That game was the start of a stretch where the champs are playing nine of 10 games at Oracle Arena and spending 25 straight days in the state of California. The second game of that stretch is the second game of TNT\u2019s Thursday doubleheader, a visit from the Dallas Mavericks at 10:30 p.m. ET . Here\u2019s a number to know as the Warriors try to take their winning streak to eight games against the team that spoiled Kawhi Leonard\u2019s season debut on Tuesday. Pace : 103.4 (5th) OffRtg : 113.8 (1st) DefRtg : 101.2 (4th) NetRtg : +12.6 (1st) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders The Warriors\u2019 effective field-goal percentage of 58.5 percent is the highest mark in NBA history. Not breaking news: The Warriors can shoot. They\u2019re on pace to be just the fourth team in the last 20 years to make more than half their shots. And when you factor in the value of 3-pointers, their shots are more valuable than any of the 1,483 other teams that have played in this league. If they can keep that mark above 56.34 percent, it will be third straight season in which the Warriors have set the all-time record for effective field-goal percentage. Through Wednesday\u2019s games, five teams \u2013 Golden State, Houston, Cleveland, New Orleans and Toronto \u2013 have a higher effective field-goal percentage than the 2008-09 Suns, owners of the 10th highest mark in NBA history. If league-wide effective field-goal percentage (52.0 percent) holds up, this would be the third straight season the league has set a new all-time high. The Warriors, of course, are the cream of the crop. And their shooting is so good, they have the highest mark in offensive efficiency in NBA history (almost 114 points scored per 100 possessions) even though they\u2019re one of only four teams that ranks in the bottom 11 in free-throw rate (21st) , turnover percentage (25th) and offensive rebounding percentage (20th) . The effective field-goal percentage could certainly regress. But 28 games isn\u2019t a small sample size anymore, and 58.5 percent is a higher effective field-goal percentage than the Warriors had in any 28-game stretch last season. From every area of the floor, the Warriors have shot better than they did last season, seeing their biggest increase from mid-range (between the paint and the 3-point line), where they were already the best shooting team in the league last season. The Warriors aren\u2019t exactly the anti-Rockets, but they don\u2019t avoid those mid-range shots nearly as much as Houston does. Klay Thompson ranks eighth in the league with 143 mid-range attempts , and Curry (55 percent), Thompson (50 percent) and Kevin Durant (50 percent) are three of only nine players who have shot 50 percent or better on at least 50 . The Warriors have been depending on their jumpers a little more than they have in the past. This season, 58 percent of their shots , the third highest rate in the league (and up from 56 percent last season), have come from outside the paint. For the Warriors and for a league as a whole, shots in the paint are worth more than shots from outside the paint. The champs are one of nine teams that have taken less than 30 percent of their shots from the restricted area, the area of the floor that yields the most points per attempt (1.3). Along with fewer shots in the paint have come fewer trips to the free throw line. Even though they\u2019re playing at a faster pace than last season and shooting better from the line , the Warriors have scored 1.1 fewer points per game on free throws. Still, the shooting. It was great before and it\u2019s better now. And you can make up for other deficiencies by putting the ball in the basket more effectively than any team in NBA history. Curry and Durant actually have seen a drop in effective field goal percentage from last season. So have Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and JaVale McGee. But Klay Thompson and Draymond Green have seen increases. Nick Young and Omri Casspi have shot better than the guys they replaced. And David West, in his 15th season, has been the second most improved shooter in the league, seeing his effective field-goal percentage jump from 54 percent to 68 percent, having shot 83 percent in the restricted area and 62 percent from mid-range . Iguodala (-8.8 percent) and Livingston (-5.8 percent) are both in the bottom 11 of that list, and are the only Warriors (of the 15 that have played this season) with effective field-goal percentages below the league average . But it\u2019s all about the three perimeter players who have taken more than half (53 percent) of the Warriors\u2019 shots. Among the 31 players who have attempted at least 400 shots this season, Thompson, Durant and Curry rank second, third and fourth in effective field-goal percentage , with only LeBron James ahead of them. Shooting is the most important thing in basketball. The Warriors do it more effectively than any other team in history, and that remains the most critical aspect of their quest to win their third championship in the last four years. 1. The Warriors have had the league\u2019s best defense since Nov. 1 , having allowed 98.4 points per 100 possessions over their last 20 games. They\u2019re one of two teams (the Spurs are the other) that has ranked in the top four defensively each of the last four seasons. But the champs got off to a slow start on that end of the floor, allowing 108 points per 100 possessions through their first eight games and ranking 26th defensively in October . Their schedule has been a factor in their improvement. In their 20 games since Nov. 1, they\u2019ve played just four against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency and seven against the bottom 10 . Things will stay easy in that regard, with their next four games against teams \u2013 Dallas, the Lakers (x 2) and Memphis \u2013 that rank in the bottom 10. For the season, the Warriors lead the league in opponent effective field goal percentage , No. 1 in opponent field goal percentage both in the paint and outside it. This could be the third time in the last four seasons that they ranked No. 1 in effective field goal percentage on both ends of the floor. The only other team to do it in the last 40 years was the 1980-81 Sixers. But as is the case on offense, they haven\u2019t been so great in the other three factors of efficiency. They\u2019ve ben a below-average team in regard to defensive rebounding percentage and opponent turnover percentage, and they\u2019re right around the league average in opponent free throw rate. All six of their losses have come when their opponents have scored at least 24 points off turnovers and\/or at least 18 on second chances . Still, the most important thing you can do defensively is make your opponents miss shots and no team has done that better than the Warriors. They had a slow start, but, with the most talent in the league and two championships already in hand, they\u2019re not a team that\u2019s going to wait until April to flip the switch defensively. Their Christmas game against Cleveland should be a good test, though. 2. The lineup of Curry, Thompson, Iguodala, Durant and Green has been outscored by 13 points in its 58 minutes together . . This is the SuperDeath Lineup or the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup, that destroyed opponents last season, outscoring them by 24 points per 100 possessions in 224 regular-season minutes ( the best mark among lineups that played 200 or more ) and by 33 in 65 playoff minutes . This season, the lineup has been outscored in seven of the 13 games it\u2019s played in. In its 71 total games together (since the start of last season), its worst game was at Boston on Nov. 16, when the Celtics outscored it 22-9 in a little more than eight minutes. Problems with the lineup have been mostly on defense, where opponents have shot 49 percent from the field and have gone to the line 48 times in the 58 minutes. To make things worse, their opponents have shot 45-for-48 (94 percent) on those free throws. In Boston, Kyrie Irving was 7-for-7 from the line down the stretch against the Hamptons Five, and none of those free throws came on intentional fouls. Opponent free throw rate was high against the lineup last season, too. But it didn\u2019t matter, because the Warriors shot so much better than their opponents in those minutes and took care of the ball better than they usually did. That hasn\u2019t been the case this season. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .
