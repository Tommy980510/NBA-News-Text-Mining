The team that represented the Eastern Conference in the 2020 Finals sits in sixth place in the All-Star break at 18-18. They\u2019ve been affected by both injuries and COVID-19-related absences, but also just haven\u2019t played at the level we saw from them in the bubble. That\u2019s been especially true on offense, where they Heat rank 25th, having scored 4.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season. Only the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder have seen bigger drop-offs. Even in winning seven of their last eight games before the All-Star break, the Heat were a below-average 3-point shooting team. The Heat do have a top-10 defense and they won 11 of their last 15 before the break to get back into the mix for one of the top six spots in the East. Bam Adebayo, 23, continues to blossom into one of the best two-way big men in the league. But they will need to be much better offensively in the second half of the season if they\u2019re going to compete with the three best teams in the Eastern Conference, against whom they\u2019re currently 1-5. Biggest question going into the second half: Is there a trade to be made? Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has shown on multiple occasions that he can get the most out of however much talent he\u2019s been given. And we should expect this team, should it remain as is, to play better as the season goes on. But team president Pat Riley could be on the hunt for another star to play alongside Adebayo and Jimmy Butler, and he probably has the right combination of young talent and tradeable contracts to get a deal done if a star were to become available. Playoffs or lottery?: If the Heat stay relatively healthy and continue to play the way they have over the last month, they\u2019re one of the six best teams in the Eastern Conference. But more absences or an inability to find their offense could keep them in the play-in group and put them at risk of continuing a pattern where they\u2019ve missed the playoffs every other year since LeBron James left Miami in 2014. A healthy Butler could be all that the Heat need. They\u2019re 14-8 when he\u2019s been in the lineup (with much better numbers on both ends of the floor) and 4-10 without him. Best bet is that they\u2019re fighting for the No. 4 and 5 spots in the East with a couple of other teams \u2014 the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors \u2014 that have thus far had disappointing seasons after trips deep into the playoffs six months ago. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":507183,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-milwaukee-bucks","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Milwaukee Bucks","content":"First half summary: This always was going to be a tricky season for the Bucks. Tearing up the regular season the way they did in 2018-19 and (mostly) 2019-20 was fun. But it ultimately got them nothing with their abrupt playoff exits against Toronto and Miami, respectively. Those were the teams who punched the Finals tickets Milwaukee so craved. They still crave that as their destination, but will try to get there by peaking at just the right time. As if that\u2019s completely under their control. Reigning two-time Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo will get some votes again for that award, and sidekick Khris Middleton was seen as an All-Star snub for yet another consistently strong season. Newcomer Jrue Holiday still looks like a winning move, while Donte DiVicenzo has brought energy, defense and bonus scoring in his promotion to starting shooting guard. But there\u2019s also this: In their first two seasons under coach Mike Budenholzer, the Bucks ranked fourth and first in offensive and defensive efficiency (2018-19), then eighth and first last year. Currently they\u2019re second offensively \u2014 scoring more than any Bucks team in history, in fact \u2014 but 12 th defensively. Not bad, but not stifling as in the recent past. Of course, if you wanted stifling, you could just imagine what the rest of this season would be like for Milwaukee if Antetokounmpo had in December declined to sign his five-year, $228 million contract extension and was planning to hit free agency this summer. That \u201cvictory\u201d to start the season is one the Bucks would like to bracket with one at the end. Biggest question going into the second half: Where does Jrue Holiday fit in the Bucks\u2019 efficiency over the second half and postseason, as well as in their long-term plans? Holiday missed 10 games to health and safety protocols, acknowledging that he got the virus and felt miserable for a spell. The Bucks split those, which means they are 17-9 when Holiday has played, and that winning percentage (.654) would have been good for two additional victories by now, putting the Bucks in a 24-14 tie with Philadelphia atop the East. But there still was some acclimating going on before Holiday went out \u2014 he to them, them to him \u2014 for the Bucks to run as a well-oiled defensive machine. And now that he\u2019s eligible to negotiate an extension to stick in Milwaukee for seasons to come, there\u2019s more of a clock on what this season\u2019s results will mean to 2021-22 and beyond. Giving up what the Bucks did (Eric Bledsoe and a bunch of Draft picks) makes it vital Holiday stays and plays well as more than a one-off. Playoffs or lottery?: Playoffs. But how deep? Many following the Bucks think it\u2019s going to have to be very deep \u2014 as in a maxed-out conference finals, at least, if not a trip to the championship round \u2014 for Budenholzer to return for a fourth season. The tweaks that he and his staff have made at both ends so far have been fine \u2014 switching defensively wasn\u2019t a Bucks thing till now \u2014 but the test will come in in-game and in-series adjustments when locked into best-of-seven survival. At their best, there\u2019s no reason the Bucks can\u2019t emerge from the East. And that\u2019s what the approach this season has been about, being at their best in July and August, not March. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":506462,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-orlando-magic","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Orlando Magic","content":"First half summary:  Orlando started 2020-21 off winning six of its first eight before serious injuries started to mount. It began with Markelle Fultz suffering a season-ending torn ACL on Jan. 6 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. From there, the Magic lost six in a row on the way of going 7-19 from Fultz\u2019s injury to Feb. 27, as Aaron Gordon (ankle), Cole Anthony (ribs) and James Ennis III (calf) all suffered injuries that are expected to keep them out until after the All-Star break. Injuries from those three players alone accounted for a total of 36 missed games. But the truth is Orlando\u2019s injury woes go all the way back to last summer\u2019s NBA bubble, where Jonathan Isaac \u2014 one of the team\u2019s young building blocks \u2014 suffered a torn ACL and meniscus that forced him to miss all of the 2020-21 season. Despite the injuries, the Magic found a way to win four of their last eight games heading into March with multiple lineups featuring All-Star center Nikola Vucevic surrounded by players such as Ennis, Al-Farouq Aminu, Dwayne Bacon, Gary Clark, Michael Carter-Williams and Evan Fournier. Still, it\u2019s unlikely they can salvage the season, even with the pending returns of Anthony and Gordon. The losses of Fultz and Isaac are just too much to bear, despite coach Steve Clifford\u2019s ability to consistently field competitive lineups. Biggest question going into the second half: Is it time to blow it up in Orlando? That\u2019s the question the Magic need to seriously ponder as they endure the inevitable challenges to come in the second half of the season. Reports indicate Orlando isn\u2019t inclined to move on from its assets, despite the Magic falling in the first round of the playoffs in each of the last two seasons. That\u2019s understandable given that nobody really knows what Orlando\u2019s true ceiling is. Perhaps the Magic try to employ the simple wait-and-see approach next season with a fully healthy squad. Either way, we should see an indication of how Orlando plans to proceed based on how it handles the March 25 trade deadline. Clifford is already working to figure out exactly how Mo Bamba fits, after a series of bad luck has plagued the third-year pro\u2019s career. The sixth pick of the 2018 draft, Mamba left the NBA bubble early last season after catching COVID-19 back in June, and the effects from that illness affected his availability earlier this season. Playoffs or lottery?: Expect plenty of fight in the second half from the undermanned Magic, which should get Gordon and Anthony back sometime in March. But that likely won\u2019t prevent the team from heading back to the lottery for the first time since selecting Bamba. If Orlando misses the playoffs, don\u2019t take it as a true indication of the team\u2019s talent. Injuries clearly derailed a season in which the Magic were expected to make it back to the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The Magic have plenty of tradable assets in Vucevic, Gordon, Fournier (who is in the final year of his contract) and Terrance Ross as they look to build around Isaac and Fultz. Vucevic has thrived in the void left by all the injuries. So, the Magic standing pat at the deadline shouldn\u2019t alarm anyone. The 6-2 start wasn\u2019t a fluke, despite the wins coming mostly against struggling teams. They owe it to themselves to take their time determining the future. \u2014 Michael C. Wright"},{"id":506335,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-philadelphia-76ers","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Philadelphia 76ers","content":"First half summary: The Philadelphia 76ers made a coaching change and renovations to their starting lineup. But most important may be that they have Joel Embiid playing the best basketball of his career. The fifth-year center, set to turn 27 on March 16, is both a Kia MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year candidate, averaging an efficient 30.2 ppg, 11.6 rpg and 1.4 bpg. The Sixers have outscored their opponents by 11.1 points with Embiid on the floor and are 23-7 in games he\u2019s played, sitting atop the Eastern Conference at 24-12 overall. Even with the additions of Seth Curry and Danny Green, Tobias Harris being much improved and Embiid shooting 51% from mid-range, the Sixers aren\u2019t much better offensively than they were a season ago. With the league average seeing a jump of 1.3 points scored per 100 possessions, the Sixers have scored only 1.2 per 100 more than they did last season and rank 14th offensively at the break. But they\u2019ve been more consistent on defense (where they rank fourth) and have the league\u2019s best record (15-5) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Biggest question going into the second half: Can they improve their depth? When the Sixers lost to the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals, they were outscored by an amazing 109 points in the 99 minutes that Embiid was on the bench. Two years later, they still have depth issues, having been outscored by 6.3 points per 100 possessions with Embiid off the floor. They\u2019ve staggered their starters under coach Doc Rivers far less than they did under Brett Brown, often using a full, five-man bench unit. But third-year guard Shake Milton has been their only (somewhat) reliable reserve. So they could certainly be in the market for an additional piece or two at the trade deadline. Playoffs or lottery?: The Sixers are in a three-team race atop the Eastern Conference, currently 1-1 against the Brooklyn Nets and having not yet played the Milwaukee Bucks. These are three unique teams and potential playoff meetings could come down to matchups. The Sixers have a big matchup advantage at center, along with the player (Ben Simmons) best fit to defend Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kevin Durant. Brooklyn looks like the favorite in the East, but anything could happen between now and mid-May. With an MVP candidate, another All-Star and a chance at a championship, the Sixers will surely go for it. That makes them a prime candidate to go shopping at the deadline, perhaps for a player than can give them an advantage against other second units while also fitting alongside Simmons and Embiid. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":506434,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Cleveland Cavaliers","content":"First half summary: Judged by record alone, the Cavaliers\u2019 14-22 first half might not seem so bad. In the jammed-up Eastern Conference that had them just 4.5 games out of fifth place, it represented a vast improvement over the 14-40 record they dragged into last year\u2019s All-Star break. But there were eight teams bunched between Cleveland and fifth place this time. And for all their young talent, the Cavs have earned their bumpy season, mostly with the 10-game losing streak that chewed up the first three weeks of February. The schedule was brutal, and injuries left coach J.B. Bickerstaff scrambling for lineups some nights. But his team pulled out of the 10-game skid by winning four in a row by an average of 7.8 points. Collin Sexton has been putting up scoring numbers not seen in Cleveland since LeBron James left. The third-year guard strung together a 10-game stretch heading into the break of 20 points or more, averaging 27.1 ppg while getting to the foul line 7.3 times night. The kiddie corps of Sexton, Darius Garland, Isaac Okoro, Jarrett Allen, Dylan Windler and Lamar Stevens, by necessity more than by design, has been getting reps. Along with hard lessons. Biggest question going into the second half: What happens with Andre Drummond? The talented big man has been rendered somewhat obsolete in today\u2019s NBA, with his work down low out of whack in this 3-point world. The Cavs have shut him down , hoping to preserve him physically for a trade. Is there a market for a dinosaur center who can still dominate the paint and get you extra possessions, with what\u2019s left of his $28.7 million salary and an appetite for stats to earn his next payday? Maybe, if teams such as Brooklyn, Toronto, Charlotte, or either of the two L.A. teams get desperate. From the Cavs\u2019 point of view, though, Drummond probably has played his last game for them, exiting either by trade or, after March 25, buyout. Playoffs or lottery?: Lottery, which might not have as much appeal to a team already heavy with youth. But let\u2019s be frank, Cleveland headed into the break ranked 29th in offensive efficiency and 22nd defensively. They are taking baby steps in a variety of tangibles \u2014 like getting outscored by more than 10 points per game on 3-pointers, since they shoot the fewest in the NBA \u2014 and intangibles that young players need time and experience to learn. Kevin Love is almost in the Drummond boat, unloadable if there is a market. But the Cavs\u2019 future rests in the backcourt pieces in place, in Okoro as an anchor defensively and in time some help on the wings. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":507157,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-toronto-raptors","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Toronto Raptors","content":"First half summary: The Toronto Raptors have taken the step backward that some were expecting last season, when they responded to the departure of Kawhi Leonard by finishing second in the Eastern Conference with a better defense than they had with the two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year. They saw another former DPOY (Marc Gasol) depart for L.A. this past offseason and have dropped from second to 18th in defensive efficiency, with only two teams having seen bigger jumps in points allowed per 100 possessions. With increased production from some of their younger players, the Raptors\u2019 offense has been improved. And the team had seemingly found a rhythm with a 9-3 stretch through the first few weeks of February that included wins over each of the top three teams in the East. But, dealing with injuries and COVID-19-related absences, the Raptors stumbled into the All-Star break with four losses in their last five games. With their defeat by the Celtics in their final game before the break, the Raptors became the first team to match its loss total from last season. Biggest question going into the second half: Is Kyle Lowry long for Toronto\/Tampa? Lowry will be 35 at the end of March, and his ninth season with the Raptors is the last on his current contract. The rest of the Raptors\u2019 core is much younger and Fred VanVleet is a budding star who essentially plays the same position as Lowry. Other contenders could certainly use Lowry and if there\u2019s an offer that helps the Raptors build around VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam, it might be difficult to pass up. That\u2019s especially true given that they\u2019re no longer among the best teams in the East and could be left with nothing if Lowry walks in the offseason. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to deal the best player in franchise history. Playoffs or lottery?: Assuming that Lowry stays put, the Raptors can finish in the top six in the East. Even with their head-to-head loss on Thursday, they\u2019re just two games behind the fourth-place Celtics. At worst, the Raptors are in the top half of the play-in group, in good shape to make their eighth straight trip to the postseason. But to keep the league\u2019s longest streak of trips to the second round (five straight years) alive, they\u2019d probably have to beat the Celtics or Miami Heat in a No. 4-5 series. That\u2019s certainly not impossible. The Raptors had Lowry, Anunoby and Siakam together for just 1 1\/2 of their final 22 games before the break, and they still won 12 of those 22 games. Their 3-point shooting remains potent and they have the ability to defend at a top-five level over the second half of the season. But even at their best, they\u2019re still a step below the elite teams in the East. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":507238,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-chicago-bulls","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Chicago Bulls","content":"First half summary: If the NBA season ended today, the Bulls would be in the playoffs (thanks, play-in mechanism!). Their 16-18 record is a considerable improvement \u2014 the past three seasons, Chicago was an average of 21 games under .500 at the All-Star break. With a 2-14 mark against teams with winning records when they played, the Bulls have been beating foes they\u2019re supposed to \u2014 and the first-half schedule has had plenty of them. But don\u2019t overlook some real strides forward by a young core stuck in idle for a while. Zach LaVine reached his goal of All-Star status, carrying the Bulls\u2019 offense at 28.7 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 5.1 apg, while knocking on the door of the 50\/40\/90 percent club of elite shooters. Their bench, laden with veterans such as Thaddeus Young and Garrett Temple, has been their best unit many nights. And newcomers Arturas Karnisovas and Billy Donovan, the VP of basketball operations and the head coach, interact already as if they\u2019ve been working together for years rather than months. Donovan\u2019s patience and leadership have drawn praise from players who are growing up by the day. Biggest questions going into the second half: First, is Coby White the answer at point guard? What can the Bulls do to keep Lauri Markkanen \u2014 and to a lesser extent, Wendell Carter Jr. \u2014 healthy? And will Chicago be a buyer or a seller at the March 25 trade deadline? White has established himself as a starter, and even if he isn\u2019t a classic playmaker (5.0 apg), his scoring and foul shooting in the clutch put pressure on defenses. Markkanen and Carter have had more fluke injuries than career-jeopardizing setbacks, but Markkanen\u2019s 19.1 ppg in just 14 games looks more like a luxury than an essential piece, if only because Chicago has had to forge on without him so often. As for the trade deadline, the Bulls are likely to sit it out. Their most coveted player, Young, still has great value on this team on the verge of shedding its training wheels. Playoffs or lottery?: Playoffs. The Bulls\u2019 schedule in the second half, both in quantity (38 games) and quality of opponents, looks too rigorous for them to climb beyond a play-in spot. But this team needs that whiff of the postseason as a developmental step. They could scare somebody in the first round, with LaVine or White getting hot and a nothing-to-lose approach. \u201cWe always have fight,\u201d LaVine said. Donovan\u2019s patience has been rewarded so far, and he reasonably can expect to see improvements by the end of the regular season, not unlike those he and fans have seen over their first 34 games. The Bulls have been one of the NBA\u2019s happiest surprises so far in 2020-21. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":507252,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-washington-wizards","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Washington Wizards","content":"First half summary:  Thank heaven for the Eastern Conference\u2019s parity, which has even the Wizards dreaming some play-in playoff dreams. Their 14-20 record is the NBA\u2019s seventh-worst, leaving them 12 th in the East, but the prospect of snagging the 10 th spot \u2014 a mere 1.5 games away \u2014 is a way to keep them, and the second half of their season, interesting. We say \u201ckeep\u201d because the Wizards went from moribund (6-17) early in the season to interesting, even a little compelling when they began the 8-3 stretch in mid-February that carried them to the break. They\u2019ve been beating mostly good teams, too, with a 3-1 West Coast trip central to the improvement. Coach Scott Brooks has tinkered with his lineups and rotation, while building up Rui Hachimura\u2019s defensive confidence and impact. Bradley Beal, the league\u2019s leading scorer (32.9 ppg), is the All-Star everyone knew he was regardless of team record. Robin Lopez has been a great insurance policy at center with rim-running starter Thomas Bryant lost to ACL surgery. Davis Bertans is in shape and rhythm with his shooting range again, and then there\u2019s that irrepressible point guard whose obituaries have proven premature. Biggest question going into the second half: Has the real Russell Westbrook stood up? Sure looks like it, after many wondered if the former OKC and Houston juggernaut had lost some skills and would fight any adjustment necessary to his game. Westbrook seems to have won the argument, since he said all along it was the injury to his left quadriceps muscle that had hampered him in the early going. He has stopped jacking up 3-pointers and resumed attacking the basket, playing like the Westbrook of old in a way that helps the Wizards. In January, Westbrook shot 39.8% overall and averaged 7.4 rpg and 7.9 apg. Not bad, but in February, he was more accurate (43.8%) while getting back to his triple-double ways (19.1 ppg, 10.4 rpg, 9.6 apg). He took 39 3-pointers in 14 games compared to 37 in seven in January. If the Westbrook seen lately by the Wizards is the one they\u2019ll get the rest of the way, even playing .500 ball should get them a real shot at the postseason. Which is a great lesson-in-waiting for his many young teammates. Playoffs or lottery?: Let\u2019s go with playoffs, based on what seems to be a legit turnaround in Washington\u2019s season. Brooks has hung in there, as has GM Tommy Sheppard, believing in and sticking with their plan, and their boss Ted Leonsis \u2014 he who oversaw Ernie Grunfeld for, like, forever \u2014 remains patient. The Wizards have an electric backcourt, promising youth and an interesting global culture, with a second half that could be worlds away from their first 34 games. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":507248,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/by-the-numbers-nba-all-star-2021","date":"2021-03-05","title":"By the numbers: NBA All-Star 2021","content":"ATLANTA \u2014 NBA All-Star 2021 will take place on Sunday, March 7 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, reaching fans in 215 countries and territories in more than 50 languages on their televisions, computers, mobile phones and tablets.

Griffin and the Pistons have agreed to a buyout of his deal that will make the big man an unrestricted free agent. The news was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed by several other outlets. Many of the NBA\u2019s top playoff teams have interest in Griffin, Wojnarowski reports, and he is expected to make his decision on where to land next in the near future. The parting of ways is hardly a surprise as the Pistons and Griffin agreed to start the process of moving him back in mid-February. The Pistons acquired Griffin from the LA Clippers in January of 2018 via a trade. \u201cI am grateful to the Pistons for understanding what I want to accomplish in my career and for working together on the best path forward,\u201d Griffin said in a statement to ESPN in February. The 31-year-old forward has started 20 games for Detroit this season and is averaging career lows for points (12.3), field goal attempts (11.1) and free throw attempts (3.1). For his career, the former No. 1 overall pick is averaging 21.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists. He played in just 18 games last season after requiring season-ending left-knee surgery. The question now is how valuable he might be to a contending team. He had a terrific 2018-19 season for the Pistons, helping them to the playoffs, but his health has been a concern in Detroit, just as it had been when he was with the Clippers. If healthy, Griffin can offer size, versatility and veteran leadership to a contender. He was traded to the Pistons just seven months after signing a $171 million, five-year contract to stay with the Clippers. A couple seasons ago, he averaged a career-high 24.5 ppg \u2014 but even in that 2018-19 campaign, Detroit was swept in the first round of the playoffs, and the team wasn\u2019t able to build on that. Known for his athletic dunking prowess in his heyday, Griffin has not recorded a dunk in an NBA game since Dec. 12, 2019 \u2014 a span in which more than 440 other NBA players have gotten at least one dunk. If the Pistons are moving on from Griffin, one of his former teammates is reportedly also set to be traded. Cleveland Cavaliers center Andre Drummond \u2014 who played for Detroit from 2012-20 \u2014 is set to be moved soon per multiple reports. Griffin has already reinvented himself once, so it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t do so again. Like many players in this 3-point era, he added that shot to his repertoire a few years back and it helped catapult him back to All-Star level in 2018-19 \u2014 he made 189 3\u2019s that season, two shy from matching the total from his first eight seasons combined, and averaged 24.5 points. Detroit is just 10-26 this season and had three first-round picks in last year\u2019s draft. A couple of them \u2014 Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey \u2014 have shown some promise.

That\u2019s precisely what Embiid did in dropping a 40-piece with 19 rebounds Wednesday in cooking former two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz to keep the 76ers atop the Eastern Conference standings at 24-12. \u201cThose are the matchups that you want to go out there and just dominate and prove to everybody that as a team, we have a great team, and, individually, you should be up there when it comes to those rankings and stuff.\u201d Well, Embiid definitely ranks \u201cup there\u201d going into All-Star break, while Nikola Jokic moves to No. 2, LeBron James dips down to third, Damian Lillard rises to fourth, and Luka Doncic finally cracks the top five. Jokic helped the Nuggets run off four straight victories since publication of last week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, averaging a triple-double (28.8 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 10.2 apg) over that span. Doncic, meanwhile, averaged nearly a triple-double (30 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 8.0 apg) over his last two games to lead Dallas to nine wins in its last 11 outings. As for James, the 36-year-old played a pivotal role in guiding the Lakers back on track after a four-game skid. Yet, after snagging two straight wins, Los Angeles has since fallen in two consecutive contests, with the four-time Kia MVP sitting in Wednesday\u2019s loss to Sacramento due to a sore ankle. James Harden ticks up a couple of slots, too. The 2018 MVP racked up his eighth triple-double Wednesday during a reunion in Houston to pace Brooklyn in capturing victory No. 10 in the Nets\u2019 last 11 contests. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats: 30.2 ppg, 11.6 rpg, 3.3 apg, 1.4 bpg, 1.2 spg Embiid\u2019s got the right idea here. \u201cI keep going back to the same thing: you can\u2019t be in those conversations without winning,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re winning, we\u2019re first in the East, we beat the best team in the league.\u201d Embiid worked the Jazz inside Wednesday to the beat of the 76ers outscoring them 64-44 in the paint in a game they trailed by as many as 13 points. Embiid put up 40 or more in two of his last three games. Philadelphia owns a record of 6-1 this season when Embiid scores 38 or more. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Season stats: 27.1 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 8.6 apg, 1.6 spg In helping the Nuggets win their third straight on Tuesday, Jokic produced his 50 th career triple-double and ninth of the season as they outscored the Milwaukee Bucks 56-32 in the paint. Jokic narrowly missed notching two 30-point triple-doubles in a back-to-back set against Chicago and Milwaukee, missing the triple-double vs. the Bulls by one assist. Additionally, he was just two assists short of three straight triple-doubles in a win against the Indiana Pacers, falling two assists shy of one in that game. Jokic and Wilt Chamberlain are the only centers in NBA history to tally 50 or more triple-doubles over a career. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 25.8 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 7.8 apg, 1.1 spg He put together his eighth game this season with 30-plus points, five-plus rebounds and four-plus assists Tuesday in a loss to the red-hot Phoenix Suns, before sitting out of Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Sacramento Kings due to a sore ankle. It marked the first game James has missed all season. The All-Star break comes at just the right time for James, who has been forced to carry the Lakers in the absence of Anthony Davis. Davis hasn\u2019t played since Valentine\u2019s Day due to a calf strain and Achilles tendinosis, but appears to be on the verge of returning. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 5 Season stats: 29.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 8.0 apg, 1.0 spg Kent Bazemore didn\u2019t have a chance here , but that\u2019s the case with most defenders facing Lillard. He put up 22 points Wednesday in Portland\u2019s 108-106 win over Golden State, and then lit up Sacramento for 44 the next night in a 123-119 win. He\u2019s averaged 31 ppg and 7.5 apg in his last four games in helping Portland go 3-1 during that stretch. We still need to see more. Portland is 6-8 against teams that are .500 or better and 15-6 against teams below .500. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 7 Season stats: 28.6 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 9.0 apg, 1.0 spg Lower back tightness forced Doncic to miss his second game of the season Wednesday as Dallas defeated Oklahoma City, but the respite might have been much needed given the way he\u2019s carried the Mavericks all season. If you\u2019re tuning in for Sunday\u2019s NBA All-Star Game , don\u2019t worry about Doncic sitting out. Coach Rick Carlisle said Wednesday\u2019s absence shouldn\u2019t affect the All-Star starter\u2019s availability. Carlisle expects Doncic to participate. Doncic is also scheduled to compete in the Taco Bell Skills Challenge alongside Chris Paul, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Robert Covington and Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107. 6. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 8. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets 9. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers 10.

The six-time NBA champion said when the Hornets selected Ball with the No. 3 overall pick they hoped the crafty 6-foot-6 point guard would eventually rise to the level of becoming an All-Star. Jordan likes the way Ball is trending. \u201cI think Melo has adjusted to the NBA game better than any of us ever thought this early in his career,\u201d Jordan told The Associated Press in an email. \u201cHe has exceeded our expectations so far this season.\u201d Ball leads all rookies in most statistical categories, including points (15.8), assists (6.3), rebounds (6) and steals (1.6) per game. More importantly, Ball\u2019s game \u2014 which includes an array of slick, needle-threading passes \u2014 has brought some needed pizzazz and star potential to a franchise mired in obscurity for years. The Hornets are 17-18 entering the All-Star break, just a game behind the fourth place Boston Celtics in the ultra-tight Eastern Conference. \u201cHe\u2019s the real deal,\u201d Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said. Warriors forward Draymond Green recently tweeted \u201cLaMelo is a problem!\u201d \u201cRight now, with the way things look, he looks like NBA rookie of the year to me,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting it done statistically, their team is winning. He\u2019s got energy, he\u2019s got a vibe, he\u2019s got swagger. If you like watching players that play with flair, he\u2019s right up there.\u201d Ball, who grew up watching Penny Hardaway and Jamal Crawford highlights, sees things on the court most players don\u2019t. He regularly delivers on-time behind-the-back passes leading to transition layups, kick-outs for open 3-pointers and alley-oop lobs for dunks off the pick-and-roll, many of those going to high-flying Miles Bridges, earning the duo the nickname \u201cAirBnB.\u201d Ball\u2019s impact with the Hornets was almost immediate, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double in just his 10th NBA game. Still, it took 20 games before Hornets coach James Borrego inserted him into the starting lineup following an injury to Devonte Graham. It\u2019s unlikely Ball is giving up the position anytime soon. The 19-year-old has only elevated his game in 15 starts, averaging 20.6 points, 6.6 assists and 6.2 rebounds and has already won NBA rookie of the month twice. \u201cMe being me, I\u2019m never going to say putting me on the bench was something smart or good to do,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt always feels like when I\u2019m on the court I\u2019m helping. \u2026 But I think one of the reasons is because we didn\u2019t have no summer league, so he probably wanted to ease me into it.\u201d Said Borrego: \u201cHis growth, his fearlessness, his ability to bounce back even when things don\u2019t go his way on one end of the floor \u2026 he\u2019s a special kid.\u201d Before the NBA draft three where were concerns about Ball\u2019s unorthodox shooting form with a lower release point than most. He\u2019s proven doubters wrong by finding ways to create his own shot while making 37.8% from beyond the arc. Ball said coaches have tried to change his shooting form just about everywhere he\u2019s been, but he\u2019s steadfastly resisted. \u201cI always said, \u2018This is how I shoot,\u2019\u201d Ball said. \u201cI\u2019m confident in it. I feel good letting it go. Even coming here (to the Hornets), they low-key tried to adjust it a little but I said, \u2018No, this is how I shoot\u2019 and I just stuck with it.\u201d \u201cI think people wondered at the beginning: was he a good enough shooter?\u201d Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a concern.\u201d That ability to shoot has forced teams to defend Ball behind the arc, making it easier for him to penetrate and score or dish. \u201cMan, he\u2019s good,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m very impressed with his playmaking ability, his competitiveness, but his joy. \u2026 He\u2019s very talented; he can do many different things.\u201d Ball said he wants to add some muscle to frame and Jordan added \u201cwe believe that he will continue to work and get better as a player.\u201d Ball\u2019s long-term NBA goal is simple, if not lofty: he wants to be a Hall of Famer like Jordan. Nothing would please Jordan more. The Hornets haven\u2019t been to the playoffs since 2016 and haven\u2019t won a playoff series in 19 years. They\u2019ve lacked star power. Ball, with 5.7 million Instagram followers, brings national attention. And his unselfish, pass-friendly approach could make the Hornets an attractive destination for future free agents, thus making Charlotte more competitive. Like most rookies, Ball needs to continue improve on the defensive end of the court for the Hornets to achieve the consistent success. \u201cOur goal is to build a consistent winner and have free agents look at our program, just like Gordon (Hayward) did this offseason,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Melo. It\u2019s about our group of young, talented players, our coaching staff and our entire Hornets organization. All of those factors, along with Charlotte being a great city, will make us become a destination.\u201c"},{"id":506969,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-nba-all-star-draft-5-key-takeaways","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 NBA All-Star Draft: 5 key takeaways","content":"Ever since the NBA appointed the two players with the most fan votes in the East and West as All-Star Game captains and allowed them to choose their sides, the intrigue became gripping and tense. Everyone in the basketball world, it seemed, braced for the big moment: Who\u2019s the last pick? Well, it seems LeBron James and Kevin Durant aren\u2019t terribly big believers in the team currently holding the best record in the league. And in his explanation, LeBron turned the knife it a bit further, playfully, we might add: \u201cThere\u2019s no slander to the Utah Jazz. Just like in video games growing up, we never played with Utah. Even as great as Karl Malone and John Stockton was, we never picked those guys in video games.\u201d So there you have it. Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, in that order, were the final two players off the board in Thursday\u2019s 2021 All-Star Draft. It\u2019s comparable to being left in the green room on draft night, though on a much less frightening scale. The Jazz used a strong February to soar upward in the West standings, helped generously by their two All-Stars, and will obviously be armed with fresh bulletin-board ammo \u2014 should they feel it\u2019s worth using. Mitchell and Gobert can prove everyone wrong; Malone and Stockton, on the other hand, can only watch from their sofa. The LeBron-KD draft otherwise proved somewhat predictable. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the first selection among the starters, to Team LeBron; James Harden was the first selection among the reserves, to Team Durant. LeBron did choose Paul George of the Clippers, with a disclaimer: \u201cIt\u2019s the only time I\u2019ll root for this guy and his team.\u201d Anyway, the dispersal of players has created some interesting situations and matchups and team-ups for Sunday\u2019s game, which we analyze here: If creativity in All-Star Games is mainly produced by point guards \u2014 makes sense, they have the ball and tend to dictate what happens next \u2014 then Team LeBron is the heavy favorite to win most of the style points. And as you know, style points count almost as much as actual points in an All-Star format. Team LeBron has five point guards, six if you count LeBron (and you know he counts himself as one), compared to only one natural point guard in Kyrie Irving on Team Durant (two if you include Harden, who won\u2019t go into the Hall of Fame one day listed at the 1). Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard and Ben Simmons will each trigger more than a few fast breaks and lob passes and how-did-he-do-that passes headed straight for YouTube. Team LeBron therefore ranks as Sunday\u2019s likely leader in video starts. Durant wisely and slickly kept Brooklyn\u2019s Notorious B.I.G. Three intact, which would\u2019ve been even more beneficial if Durant was actually able to play. If nothing else, Durant did good to keep Irving and Harden together so they can groom their Nets chemistry even more, this time at the expense of the All-Star Game. Do Jayson Tatum and Joel Embiid, who could see the resurgent Nets in the playoffs, know they\u2019re being set up by their All-Star captain? The tastiest subplot is the pairing of Lillard and George, which means someone on Team LeBron must serve as peacemaker to what, on the surface, is a tenuous if not uncomfortable situation. To jar your memory: Last fall in the bubble, George mocked Dame on social media for missing free throws late in a game, which triggered a back-and-forth between the two stars. Dame calmly reminded everyone how he \u201csent him home\u201d from the playoffs a few years ago with the iconic puppet-wave buzzer-beater from 35 feet. When George subsequently struggled later in the bubble, he was roasted on social media by folks who squarely sided with Dame. While time has a way of healing, if not soothing, any anger, Dame is one of the league\u2019s more prideful players and also subscribes to a conspiracy theory that he\u2019s being shortchanged when it comes to respect. Remember, Doncic, and not Dame, was voted by fans to start in the All-Star Game, the latest dagger to Dame\u2019s ego. Four years ago, Durant and Russell Westbrook were teammates in the All-Star Game and it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. The former Oklahoma City teammates saw their relationship fracture when KD left for the Warriors, and were famously feuding through the midseason classic. They didn\u2019t speak at All-Star team functions, also keeping their distance in the locker room and on the bench (Harden, who is friendly with both, played peacemaker that weekend), only casually acknowledging each other during the game. So, who\u2019ll be appointed peacemaker for Dame-PG? The most obvious candidate is LeBron, because that\u2019s what captains are for, right? They share a mutual respect and, not too long ago, lots of big moments where they each got the better of the other in the postseason (Curry more than LeBron, if titles are the ultimate scoreboard). So it\u2019ll be refreshing to see them sharing the same uniform for once. This game deserves that. And they deserve that. They were captains last year, but that\u2019s just one reason why this will be an interesting pairing. The other? Giannis won the last two Kia MVP awards, and last season\u2019s came at the expense of LeBron, who finished runner-up and complained about his number of first-place votes. They won\u2019t require a mediator like Dame and PG will, though, so there\u2019s that. Isn\u2019t it great that Nikola Jokic and Embiid will face each other, as opposed to being teammates? This is how it ought to be, especially this season, where both big men are in the hunt for the MVP awards because of fantastic seasons. Embiid is dominant at both ends of the floor in ways not seen from a center since Hakeem Olajuwon. Meanwhile, Jokic is collecting triple-doubles at a nearly unprecedented rate for a center and showing that size isn\u2019t a deterrent for running a team, or at least having the offense go through you. So those are the sideshows to the big show. LeBron is on a three-game winning streak as captain, and by not playing, there\u2019s nothing KD can do personally to stop that. The bigger picture is this: Nobody\u2019s complaining about the game any more. And the Historically Black Colleges and Universities will be honored and funded as a result of the game being played in Atlanta, and Sunday will be all for fun. Even the Jazz will enjoy it. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

They were fun to watch, De\u2019Aaron Fox enjoyed a stretch of brilliance for a few weeks and Tyrese Haliburton became a rare Kings draft pick that actually worked out. But the Kings once again found themselves languishing near the bottom of the West, hoping to stay afloat enough to keep realistic Play-In dreams. The issues that plagued this team for much of the last decade remain. Sacramento struggles defensively most nights, can\u2019t finish tight games and lacks a true star. Fox did give it a good try to secure his first All-Star bid, but the same cannot be said of Buddy Hield. His shooting so far this season (37.7% overall) is inconsistent and mildly disappointing. Biggest question going into the second half: At some point, the Kings need to find out what they have in Marvin Bagley III. He\u2019s finally healthy but arguably is the Kings\u2019 second-best post player after Richaun Holmes. Remember, the Kings drafted Bagley ahead of Luka Doncic, and in another year must make a financial decision on his future. But more pressing is whether Bagley can command a meatier spot in the rotation this season. The Kings might decide to be sellers before the trade deadline, which means they\u2019d see what they can get for Harrison Barnes, who\u2019s playing well (career-best 40.3% from deep) by averaging 16.6 ppg and 6.2 rpg. It\u2019s perhaps too premature to pull the plug on Hield, even with Haliburton more than capable of playing next Fox (22.8 ppg, 7.4 apg). Sometimes you forget Haliburton is a rookie as his poise and maturity are years ahead. Still, this is the time of year when rookies, no matter how talented, suffer from the length of the season and the demands of playing so many games. The goal, therefore, for Haliburton is to remain as consistent as possible and avoid the dreaded rookie wall. Playoffs or lottery?: Sadly, this looks like another quiet summer for the Kings, who haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2006. The West is too deep with quality teams and the Kings simply need more seasoning and, quite honestly, better players in the rotation. Plus, they surrender the highest points in the league and their defensive issues won\u2019t be solved this season. With the possible exception of the Knicks, no team has endured so many lost decades as the Kings. The memories of Chris Webber and Vlade Divac causing problems in the early 2000s are starting to fade, if they haven\u2019t already. This franchise desperately needs to form an identity that has lasting power. The good news is Haliburton, fresh off Kia Rookie of the Month honors, seems like the real deal. His maturity and composure in tight moments is well beyond his years, and at the very least he\u2019ll make the All-Rookie first team. His development is probably where the Kings and their fans should focus their attention, given that a playoff appearance is perhaps a year away, or longer. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":506444,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/all-star-2021-game-court-to-represent-hbcu-spirit","date":"2021-03-04","title":"All-Star 2021 game court to represent HBCU spirit","content":"NBA All-Star Game Presentation to Feature HBCU-Inspired Elements on Broadcast and In-Arena This weekend, the NBA will highlight and pay tribute to the vital role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) at NBA All-Star 2021 with HBCU-inspired elements incorporated on broadcast and in-arena on Sunday, March 7 from State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

The results are not definitive, outside experts say, and more independent research is needed. But the study published Thursday in JAMA Cardiology is the largest to examine the potential problem. The coronavirus can cause inflammation in many organs, including the heart. The research involved professional athletes who play football, hockey, soccer, baseball and men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball. All tested positive for COVID-19 before October and were given guideline-recommended heart tests, nearly 800 total. None had severe COVID-19 and 40% had few or no symptoms \u2014 what might be expected from a group of healthy elite athletes with an average age of 25. Severe COVID-19 is more common in older people and those with chronic health conditions. Almost 4% had abnormal results on heart tests done after they recovered but subsequent MRI exams found heart inflammation in less than 1% of the athletes. These five athletes all had COVID-19 symptoms. Whether their heart problems were caused by the virus is unknown although the researchers think that is likely. They were sidelined for about three months and returned to play without any problems, said Dr. Mathew Martinez of Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. He\u2019s the study\u2019s lead author and team cardiologist for football\u2019s New York Jets. Two previous smaller studies in college athletes recovering from the virus suggested heart inflammation might be more common. The question is of key interest to athletes, who put extra stress on their hearts during play, and undetected heart inflammation has been linked with sudden death. Whether mild COVID-19 can cause heart damage \u2019\u2019is the million-dollar question,\u201d said Dr. Richard Kovacs, co-founder of the American College of Cardiology\u2019s Sports & Exercise Council. And whether severe COVID-19 symptoms increase the chances of having fleeting or long-lasting heart damage \u2018\u2019is part of the puzzle,\u2019\u2019 he said. Kovacs said the study has several weaknesses. Testing was done at centers affiliated or selected by each team, and results were interpreted by team-affiliated cardiologists, increasing the chances of bias. More rigorous research would have had standardized testing done at a central location and more objective specialists interpret the results, he said. Also, many of the athletes had no previous imaging exams to compare the results with, so there is no way to know for certain if abnormalities found during the study were related to the virus. \u201dThere is clearly more work to do but I think it is very helpful additional evidence,\u201d said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, president-elect of the American Heart Association. Dr. Dial Hewlett, a member of a COVID-19 task force at the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said the study \u2019\u2019is extremely timely.\u201d Hewlett is a deputy health commissioner for New York\u2019s Westchester County and advises high schools and colleges on when to allow young athletes to return to play after COVID-19 infections. \u2019\u2019I\u2019m grateful that we are starting to get some data to help guide us in some of our decisions,\u201d Hewlett said."},{"id":506346,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-thursday-mar-4","date":"2021-03-04","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Thursday (Mar. 4)","content":"Kyle Lowry (PG \u2013 TOR) : $8,500 at BOS Fred VanVleet and Pascal Siakam are both out until the All-Star break, which leaves Kyle Lowry in a great spot against the Celtics. Lowry is averaging 46.4 FanDuel points in his last three games, so don\u2019t hesitate to put him in your lineups in a game that takes on more significance with only one game separating the two teams from fourth and eighth in the Eastern Conference. De\u2019Aaron Fox (PG \u2013 SAC) : $8,300 at POR Fox continues to play extremely well sans Tyler Haliburton, putting up at least 43 FanDuel points in three of his last four contests. He\u2019s provided a shade over 5x value over his last five games and has a positive game script facing the Blazers on the road in what should be a shootout. The Blazers allow 49.1 FanDue points to opposing PGs this season, making Fox an \u2018ace in the hole\u2019 for Thursday. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SG \u2013 OKC) : $8,200 at SAS SGA plays on the backend of a back-to-back set and faces another tough road matchup against the 11th best defense in the NBA. He didn\u2019t play well against the Mavericks on Wednesday, scoring 15 points with three assists, three rebounds and a block. However, he went off for a career-high 42 points with eight rebounds and four assists in their last matchup. San Antonio doesn\u2019t defend well against point guards, allowing the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing PGs this season (50.2). Gilgeous-Alexander will go toe-to-toe with Dejounte Murray, so lock him in as a good bet to exceed 40+ FanDuel points. Paul George (SG- LAC) : $7,900 at WAS It\u2019ll be hard to pass up PG-13 in a potential track meet against the Wizards. He\u2019s coming off a tough road loss on Tuesday to the Celtics after dropping 32\/5\/4 with a steal and five triples in 38 minutes. Kawhi Leonard is questionable, and Marcus Morris Jr. will miss the game due to a concussion, leaving the Clips shorthanded in the frontcourt. The Wizards run the fastest-paced offense in the league at 106.3 and rank in the bottom-five in defensive efficiency (111.7), a perfect blend for a PG explosion. He has the upside to provide 50+ FanDuel points and has a relatively safe floor at 40.7 FanDuel PPG. Trust in Yg_Trece. Khris Middleton (SF \u2013 MIL) : $7,500 at MEM Middleton is on a roll as of late, averaging 43.5 FanDuel points over his last five contests. He faces a Grizzlies team that is surrendering the seventh-most fantasy points to the SF position at 49.2 per game. As previously stated, the game total is set to 235, signaling a strong opportunity for Middleton to continue his All-Star worthy performances. With 5.8x value over the past five games, Middleton is a reliable asset tonight. Norman Powell (SF \u2013 TOR) : $7,400 at BOS Did you know that in five games without Pascal Siakam in the lineup, Powell raised his scoring average from 18.1 to 25.4 PPG? The opportunity is even riper for him to ball out with VanVleet also not in uniform. His price went up to $600 in just a day, but it\u2019s justified after averaging 33 points with four rebounds and one assist in his past two games. Don\u2019t fade the walking bucket. Harrison Barnes (SF \u2013 SAC) : $7,000 at POR Barnes continues to fly under the radar as a handy fantasy player this season. He\u2019s been playing great lately, averaging 37.6 FanDuel points over his last five games. He\u2019s hit 5.4x value in that span, and similar to De\u2019Aaron Fox, he should be able to take advantage of Portland\u2019s bottom-three defense. Barnes has been on a roll since reportedly drawing interest from contending teams, and he has no signs of slowing down. Enes Kanter (C \u2013 POR) : $6,600 vs. SAC If you like double-doubles, Kanter is your guy. He\u2019s notched a double-double in five of his last six games, and over that span, he\u2019s provided a shade under 5x value and 1.08 fantasy points per minute. He should feast in the paint against the Kings, as they rank dead last in the NBA, allowing 52.9 points per game. He\u2019s consistent and poised to have another successful outing. T.J. McConnell (PG \u2013 IND) : $5,000 vs. DEN How could we shy away from the sticky bandit? McConnell set an NBA record last night with nine steals in only one half of play against the Cavs, finishing the night with a 16-point, 13-assists and 10-steal triple-double. At only $5K, he\u2019s a literal steal for Thursday. He\u2019s dished out at least five assists in his last six games and remains a good bet to see 25+ minutes on the second leg of a back-to-back set. Don\u2019t be surprised if he sees 5x value with ease on Thursday. Isaiah Roby (PF \u2013 OKC) : $4,600 at SAS With the Thunder on the second leg of a back-to-back, Al Horford should get his typical DNP-rest designation on Thursday, giving Roby another shot to earn more minutes in a plus matchup. With LaMarcus Aldridge on the doubtful side of questionable, the Spurs will run a smaller unit, allowing Roby to get more involved in the game plan. He\u2019s accumulated a nice set of counting stats in his last two, averaging 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 steals. If he can get 30+ minutes, he could be a cheap value option."},{"id":506286,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-all-star-draft","date":"2021-03-04","title":"Team LeBron vs. Team Durant: NBA All-Star Draft rosters and results","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets have selected the team rosters for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, which will be played on Sunday, March 7 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

The two captains selected the starters in the first round and the reserves in the second round, making their picks without regard to a player\u2019s conference affiliation or position. As the top overall finisher in fan voting, James was awarded the first pick in the first round. Durant made the first pick in the second round. The captains alternated picks in each round, with Durant getting the final two picks in the first round, which had nine players instead of eight because of Tatum\u2019s addition. As part of the NBA All-Star Game format , the two teams will compete to win each quarter for their respective beneficiaries. Team LeBron will play for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and Team Durant will play for UNCF (United Negro College Fund), with both organizations providing scholarship funding to further the higher education of students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. A total of $1.75 million will be contributed to the two organizations. Each organization will receive an initial $500,000 contribution. At the end of each of the first three quarters, an additional $150,000 will be awarded to the leading team\u2019s organization \u2013 totaling $450,000 for those three quarters. A remaining $300,000 will be awarded to the organization of the team that wins the NBA All-Star Game. The winner of the NBA All-Star Game will be the first team to reach or surpass the Final Target Score. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, naming a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. The player who is named as a replacement would join the team that drafted the replaced player.

NBA Rising Stars, the league\u2019s annual showcase of premier young talent during NBA All-Star, will not be played this year due to the limitation of having All-Star events all on one night. To recognize deserving players, the NBA kept the custom of having the league\u2019s assistant coaches vote for Rising Stars rosters, which comprise 10 first- and second-year NBA players from the United States (U.S. Team) and 10 first- and second-year NBA players from outside the United States (World Team). \u2022 Full 2021 Rising Stars Roster Williamson and Morant lead a U.S. Team roster with 10 players from 10 different teams.

In eight-plus seasons with the Rockets, Harden climbed into the top 10 in franchise history in nearly every statistical category: second in scoring (18,365), first in assists (4,796), third in steals (1,087), seventh in rebounds (3,736), eighth in blocks (390), fourth in field goals made (5,391), first in 3-pointers made (2,029) and first in free throws made (5,554). \u2022 Harden enters Wednesday\u2019s game ranked 14th in the NBA in scoring (25.2 ppg) and leads the league in assists (11.0 apg). He is on pace to post just the sixth season in NBA history with a player averaging at least 25 points and 11 assists. Harden was the last player to do it in 2016-17. Prior to that, it has only been accomplished by Tiny Archibald in 1972-73 (when he became the only player to lead the league in both categories in the same season) and Oscar Robertson (three times). \u2022 The Rockets enter Wednesday\u2019s game looking to snap a 12-game losing streak \u2014 the fifth-longest losing streak in franchise history. The Rockets have averaged just 100.6 points per game since the streak began on Feb. 6 \u2013 4.5 ppg lower than any other team during that stretch. \u2022 This game features three of the top four isolation scorers in the league with Harden leading the way at 9.1 ppg, followed by John Wall in third place (5.1 ppg) and Kyrie Irving in fourth place (4.6 ppg). Of the 32 players that attempted at least 100 shots coming after seven or more dribbles, Irving (62.2%) and Harden (60.2%) rank 1-2 in effective field goal percentage , while Wall ranks 21st (48.6%). \u2022 The Nets lead the NBA in offensive efficiency , scoring 117.9 points per 100 possessions. In the 477 minutes that Harden and Irving have shared the court, the Nets\u2019 offensive rating has climbed to 122.9 with a true shooting percentage of 64.0%. 10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Damian Lillard (29.6 ppg) and Stephen Curry (29.5 ppg) enter Wednesday ranked third and fourth in the league in scoring , respectively. With CJ McCollum sidelined, Curry (4.8 per game) and Lillard (4.2 per game) are the only active players in the league averaging over four 3-pointers made per game. \u2022 The Blazers and Warriors split the first two games of the season series , with each decided by 15 points or more. In the Warriors\u2019 win on Jan. 3, Stephen Curry erupted for a career-high 62 points as he outscored Lillard and McCollum by himself, 62-60. Curry scored 15 points on 5-for-7 shooting (3-for-3 on 3-pointers, 2-for-2 on free throws) in 3:30 of matchup time against Gary Trent Jr. He also scored 14 points on 4-for-7 shooting (2-for-5 on 3-pointers, 4-for-4 on free throws) in just 28 seconds against Enes Kanter. \u2022 Lillard and Curry are both famous for having unlimited shooting range. So far this season, Lillard is shooting 22-62 (35.5%) on 3-pointers between 30-39 feet from the basket, while Curry is shooting 16-37 (43.2%) from the same distance. \u2022 The Warriors rank sixth in fast break points (14.9 per game), while Portland ranks 27th in fast break points allowed (14.4). The Warriors are 6-2 this season when they score at least 20 fast break points in a game. \u2022 The Blazers\u2019 five-man lineup of Lillard, Kanter, Robert Covington, Derrick Jones Jr. and Gary Trent Jr. has a net efficiency rating of 21.4 in 188 minutes played together over 17 games. Of the 42 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes together, this group ranks third in offensive rating (128.1) and net rating (21.4) and 13th in defensive rating (106.7)."},{"id":505410,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-rookie-ladder-march-3-edition","date":"2021-03-03","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Immanuel Quickley on rise this week","content":"It could have fallen as flat as David Letterman\u2019s awkward opening joke at the 1995 Oscars, introducing some celebrities with unusual first names ( \u201cOprah? Uma. Uma? Oprah.\u201d ). But when two celebrated NBA players met Monday night in Portland, there was only respect and admiration. \u201cMelo? LaMelo. LaMelo? Melo.\u201d And it was all good. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for him to have that name for him to embrace it. It\u2019s a blessing \u2014 it\u2019s a respect thing for me,\u201d Portland\u2019s Carmelo Anthony said about Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball, after they both lit up the Moda Center in the Trail Blazers\u2019 victory against the Hornets . The two exchanged jerseys after the game and posed for a photo happily holding them up (suggesting some third guy named \u201cAnthony Ball\u201d). Anthony, 36, had scored 29 points, stirring echos as one of the NBA\u2019s most prolific scorers of his generation. Ball, 19, scored 30 with six rebounds, eight assists and four steals, going 5-for-7 on 3-pointers. He would be named the next day NBA Rookie of the Month in the Eastern Conference, his second consecutive time winning that honor. \u201cI try to embrace the next generation of guys and the young players,\u201d Anthony told reporters afterward. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve been watching him since he was in high school. \u201cJust to be able to be across the court from him tonight, getting the chance to just really see his game up close, in person, getting to see him, what type of person he is. It was only right that we did that [swapped jerseys].\u201d Ball averaged 20.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 6.7 assists in February, while posting 45.2%, 40.7% and 86.4% shooting splits. He\u2019s the first rookie in NBA history to average at least 20, six and six for a calendar month while hitting 40% of his 3-pointers (minimum of 12 games). Hornets teammate Terry Rozier called Ball not simply a ROY favorite but a star in the making . And he noted a key development in the young guy\u2019s game since Opening Night. \u201cJust understanding the game,\u201d Rozier said. \u201cHis mind is all the way slowed down and that\u2019s why he\u2019s having the success he\u2019s having versus early in the season.\u201d With Sacramento\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton being named the West\u2019s Rookie of the Month again, the recipients of that honor have gone unchanged the past two months. Ditto for the top two rungs of the Ladder for the past two weeks. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Tuesday, March 2) Season stats: 15.7 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 19.8 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 8.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 He leads all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, steals, loose balls recovered and deflections. But enough about stats, let\u2019s go with leftover lauding. \u201cHe plays with a good spirit. You can tell his teammates like playing with him,\u201d said Portland coach Terry Stotts, telling Sirius XM radio that he spoke about Ball with Charlotte coach James Borrego. \u201cHe comes in there every day with a good attitude. Not only is his game going to be great but he\u2019s going to be great for the league.\u201d Season stats: 13.2 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 20.0 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 6.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 2 So if Ball never relinquishes his current stranglehold on Kia Rookie of the Year favorite status, Haliburton might have to settle for serious Kia Sixth Man consideration. Sacramento\u2019s record won\u2019t help there and it\u2019s possible coach Luke Walton will make him a starter. But the rookie ranks first among all reserves (min. 25 minutes, 25 games) in minutes (30.2), is ninth in 3-point accuracy (44.2), is second in assists (5.2) and tied for sixth in scoring (13.3). Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 12.5 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 5 Knicks fans might be getting a little irrationally exuberant over the success of their team with a half-season to go, but the Ladder doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s gushing too much by moving Quickley up two spots this week. He has responded nicely to some chatter last month about the \u201crookie wall.\u201d Quickley also is boosting coach Tom Thibodeau case as a Coach of the Year candidate. His minutes aren\u2019t killer \u2014 18.9, ranking 17th among rookie regulars \u2014 but his production is (23.9 points per 36 minutes, tops among newbies). Season stats: 14.8 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 17.0 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 2.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Edwards\u2019 inefficiency continues to nag him and the Timberwolves. He strung together three straight games of 20-plus points, but he is shooting 30.8% overall and 26.4% on 3-pointers over the past two weeks. He\u2019ll get a crack at asserting his Draft primacy (not his Ladder primacy) against LaMelo Ball Wednesday night at Target Center, but one game isn\u2019t going to alter two months of assessments. Season stats: 9.8 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.0 apg  Since last Ladder: 12.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 6 You\u2019ve got to go back to Feb. 6 to find a Pistons game in which Bey didn\u2019t score 10 or more points. That\u2019s the longest double-figure scoring streak among rookies so far this season, during which Bey has averaged 14.4 points, 5.5 rebounds and 29.6 minutes. He started eight of those games and shot 51.5% overall and 46.8% from the arc. With Bey, Isaiah Stewart and even Saben Lee \u2014 the jury still is out on injured Killian Hayes, the No. 7 pick \u2014 Detroit\u2019s Troy Weaver and coach Dwane Casey are showing their scouting and development chops. 6. Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Houston Rockets Season stats: 9.8 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 1.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 4 Production (not effort) dips during Rockets\u2019 losing streak.  7. James Wiseman, Golden State Warriors Season stats: 12.0 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 0.6 apg  Since last Ladder: 11.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 0.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Vaults back onto Ladder after 11-game wrist layoff.  8.

Powell will get a boatload of extra minutes in Toronto\u2019s shrunken lineup, and that should help him hit value against this price. Also, he had already hit 5x value in four of his last six games before Toronto\u2019s health woes began. As the sportsbooks suggest, this game should be low-scoring, but Powell should be responsible for a healthy chunk of Toronto\u2019s points. Montrezl Harrell (C \u2013 LAL) at SAC $6,400  I\u2019m conflicted about Harrell. On the one hand, he hardly did anything last night, and the Lakers gave him just 18 minutes. On the other hand, James and Marc Gasol are both out, and Harrell did get the start last night. I\u2019m not sure what Frank Vogel has planned for this evening, but it should involve a healthy dose of Harrell, as the Kings have struggled against opposing centers. They allow the fifth-most FanDuel points per game (FDPPG) to the position. Robert Covington (PF \u2013 POR) vs. GSW $6,200  I\u2019ll follow Harrell with another high-risk, high-reward play. Covington has been incredibly inconsistent \u2014 he just dropped 46 FD points (7.4x value against this price) on Monday, but he was averaging just 16.3 FDPPG through the three games prior. That said, he has 40-FD point upside, and he has hit that mark in four of his last seven appearances. Consider taking a shot on him tonight against the Warriors, who give up the sixth-most FDPPG to power forwards. Coby White (PG \u2013 CHI) at NOR $6,000  I absolutely love White on this slate. The Pelicans give up the most FDPPG to point guards due to their poor perimeter defense, and Chicago\u2019s guards should capitalize by scoring a ton of points from deep. The sportsbooks seem to agree, too, as the game is projected for the slate\u2019s highest total. Dennis Schroder (LAL) $5,500  With James out, Schroder will have to pick up most of the offensive work for Los Angeles. He has been averaging 27.6 FDPPG (5x value) over his last three appearances, and that was with James in the lineup, so look for him to sail far over 5x against the Kings \u2014 especially since they allow the sixth-most FDPPG to point guards. Malik Monk (SF \u2013 CHA) at MIN $4,900  Monk is a strong play tonight, especially if Gordon Hayward continues to sit. He has averaged 26.7 FDPPG (5.4x value) over his last two games, both of which Hayward missed. The Timberwolves may be a decent defense against small forwards, but Monk actually spends most of his time at shooting guard, and Minnesota allows the fifth-most FDPPG to that position. Jarred Vanderbilt (PF \u2013 MIN) vs. CHA $4,400  The Hornets give up the most FDPPG to power forwards. Vanderbilt has struggled to hit value consistently in recent games, but this is a fantastic bounce-back spot for the big man, especially if Cody Zeller continues to miss time. Talen Horton-Tucker (SG \u2013 LAL) at SAC $3,900  With Los Angeles\u2019 laundry list of injuries and absences, Horton-Tucker should get plenty of extra playing time tonight against the Kings. The guard has averaged 20.9 FDPPG over his last three games (5.4x value) despite playing less than 20 minutes in each of them, so he should easily hit 5x value here. Tomas Satoransky (PG \u2013 CHI) at NOR $3,700  As I said, I love Chicago\u2019s guards tonight, and Satoransky is no exception. He hasn\u2019t hit 5x value since last Wednesday\u2019s game against the T\u2019Wolves, but matchups with the slow-paced Suns and Nuggets will have that effect. The Pelicans play at a fast pace than both of those teams. Satoransky only needs to score 18.5 FD points to hit 5x value, and rostering him could help you fit in some studs. Terence Davis (SG \u2013 TOR) vs. DET $3,500  We started with a Raptor, and we\u2019ll end with a Raptor. Davis, priced at the absolute minimum, has hit 5x value just four times all season. However, Toronto\u2019s shortened roster ensures that he\u2019ll see the court, as he is one of three healthy guards."},{"id":505400,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-ankle-to-miss-game-vs-kings","date":"2021-03-03","title":"LeBron James (ankle) misses first game of season","content":"Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James sat out Wednesday\u2019s game against the Sacramento Kings because of a sprained left ankle.

As previously announced, the NBA family, including partners AT&T, MTN DEW\u00ae, State Farm\u00ae and Taco Bell\u00ae, will collectively provide more than $3 million in initial support to the HBCU community through the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF), UNCF (United Negro College Fund), National Association for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO), and Direct Relief\u2019s Fund for Health Equity . Through contributions and awareness, the NBA family will further the urgent and longstanding work and traditions of these organizations and institutions to create greater educational, financial and health equity. During the past year, public health data has made clear that the cumulative effect of historic racial and economic inequities in our country have worsened the impact of the pandemic on communities of color and predominately Black institutions. HBCUs \u2013 which produce 20 percent of the country\u2019s Black college graduates but only account for three percent of all colleges in the United States \u2013 were particularly impacted by COVID-19, experiencing drastic declines in funding and enrollment.

Below is more information regarding the format and beneficiaries of the All-Star Game, skills competitions and additional elements: The NBPA will also use the platform, influence and impact of All-Star to increase education around the importance of HBCUs and continue their longstanding engagement and support of these institutions. For the past three years, the union has hosted the NBPA Top 50 camps featuring twenty-five of the best players from the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) for on-court skill development and leadership and life skills sessions off the court led by current and retired NBA players. Additionally, the NBPA Foundation has continued to support HBCU student-athletes through summer school scholarship resources that help facilitate the path to graduation goals for the past two years, including this past year for those who have been particularly impacted by COVID-19.

Inequality decades in the making cannot be undone overnight, but awareness and support around these issues can start to make a difference. In that spirit, the NBA and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) have dedicated NBA All-Star 2021 to elevating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and COVID-19 equity. More than $3 million in funds and resources have been committed toward helping students and institutions address the challenges of this past year head on and begin to curb these longstanding trends. The statistics around these challenges are alarming: And so are the real stories behind the stats: \u201cWhat happened in 2020, it put a spotlight on some of the inequities that exist more specifically within the African-American community,\u201d said Dr. Harry L. Williams, President and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. \u201cAnd with the unfortunate incidents with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, this sparked the conscience of this country, it literally woke up and recognized that there are some discrepancies. \u201cWith that spotlight, organizations like the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, we\u2019ve been in a position to address some of those concerns. Our partners have stepped up and said we want to help, we want to be part of the solution.\u201d Clay Armbrister, President of Johnson C. Smith University \u2013 an HBCU in Charlotte, NC \u2013 has seen the impact that the pandemic has had on many of his students firsthand. He knows the stories of students that simply don\u2019t have the resources to virtual school, work from home, and taking care of family impacted by the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s been very challenging; many of our students come from lower economic status, they may not have the kind of resources that many other students have if they\u2019re trying to learn from home,\u201d said Armbrister. \u201cThey may not have a quiet room to go to where they can sit in for two and-a-half hours and take a class, or they may have younger siblings for whom they may have responsibilities.\u201d Other students have had trouble even affording the plane or bus ticket to return home once the semester abruptly ended. Many students returned home to limited internet access hindering their ability to adjust to full-time distance learning. Dr. Mike Sorrell, President of Paul Quinn College \u2013 an HBCU in Dallas, TX \u2013 echoed similar stories from his students as they have been off campus for the past year. \u201c Ninety percent of our students last semester were working 40 hours a week or more,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is people who are living under incredible stress and dealing with the trauma of not just the pandemic, the pandemic married to poverty. You have to understand the increased burden that is accompanied by living a life where you cannot do simple things. And that\u2019s what our students are struggling with.\u201d Sorrell equated the challenges that many of his students face to running full speed while being held by resistance bands, restricting their ability to accelerate and continue to make progress while others with greater resources are able to bypass them. \u201c When you combine the economic impact, the health impact and the psychological and social impact on our students, they\u2019re getting hit from a lot of different directions,\u201d said Dr. Michael Lomax, President and CEO of the United Negro College Fund. \u201cWe know that our students have had to work. We know that they\u2019ve had to become breadwinners. We know that they\u2019ve had to become caregivers. And all at the same time, they\u2019re trying to remain students. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need more partners who will call attention to the challenges that Black college students face and the important work that we\u2019re doing to help make sure that we have we don\u2019t lose a generation of college graduates because these graduates will be the doctors of the next 20 years. They\u2019ll be the front-line people that we rely on so much \u2013 the teachers and the lawyers, people who will be supporting the Black community in our nation.\u201d The Thurgood Marshall College Fund provides assistance for its member schools, which include the 47 publicly-supported HBCUs. The United Negro College Fund provides assistance for its 37 member schools, with a focus on private HBCUs. In light of the pandemic, both organizations launched emergency aid programs \u2013 the TMCF COVID-19 HBCU Emergency Fund and UNCF\u2019s Emergency Student Aid program \u2013 to meet the needs of students like those at Paul Quinn College and JCSU in providing financial assistance for food and housing, technology needs, food insecurities, mental health services, degree completion to HBCU students. Then there is the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), which is an advocacy association for all 101 HBCUs. Dr. Lezli Baskerville, the President of NAFEO, discussed the organization\u2019s work to close the inequities between HBCUs and other institutions of higher education throughout the country. \u201cHBCUs are not only doing better than any grouping of American colleges at graduating African-ancestry persons and sending them into high needs areas like STEM, agricultural and medical professions. But they are also maintaining their costs. Today, as with most years, the cost of college is a huge challenge and a lot of the discussions at the policy tables in education and in other areas where people are trying to figure out how you close the education gap, the economic gap, the employment gap, the welfare, healthcare, sustainability and justice gap. Because HBCUs are uniquely situated to lead in those areas because their students are among the growing population of America.\u201d Two additional battles that have been exacerbated by the pandemic are food insecurity and the demands on community health organizations. Jasmine Crowe founded Goodr in 2016 when she was blown away by how much food goes to waste while there are simultaneously so many people that go hungry every day. She was inspired to make an impact \u2013 first by cooking and delivering meals to those in need, but then saw a bigger opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m going to create an app that when businesses have excess food, they can use our app and request pick up and we\u2019ll pick it up and, and get it to people in need,\u201d she said. While that concept worked well during normal times, it shifted hard during the pandemic when offices were closed and major sporting and entertainment events were shut down, which were the primary providers of the excess food that Goodr was using to help those in need. Rather than be deterred, Crowe shifted her focus toward manufacturers and started working with farmers and the providers that supplied those big events with food in the first place. \u201cThey had no one to sell it to, so Goodr started working with them, getting that food either donated or purchased at a better price and then getting it to people. So, our business has shifted more into the distribution model as opposed to the recovery model.\u201d In addition to Goodr, the NBA is also supporting Direct Relief and the Fund for Health Equity. Direct Relief is a humanitarian aid organization, active in all 50 states and more than 100 countries, with a mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies. The Fund for Health Equity will identify and provide financial support to communities in which deep-seated effects of historic racism and socioeconomic disparities remain and are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cAs a humanitarian health organization, we see there\u2019s these chronic gaps that exist usually in poor areas, and when an emergency happens, the people who get most effected are the people who are most effected before. So, it makes tough situations, way tougher,\u201d said Thomas Tighe, President and CEO of Direct Relief. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the cushion. It\u2019s harder to bounce back because it exacerbates the challenges that already existed.\u201d A key focus for Direct Relief is a network of 14,000 non-profit community health centers that they help support. Tighe notes that those health centers are the front door to the health care system for roughly 30 million people that don\u2019t have other options. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest health system in the United States \u2013 and no one knows about it. It\u2019s hiding in plain sight,\u201d Tighe said. The goal for Tighe and Direct Relief is to pump resources into these health centers in order to keep them running, keep their health workers safe and give them to tools they need to help as many people as they possible can.\u201d NBA All-Star 2021 will not only provide funds for these schools and organizations, it will help them gain more exposure to share their stories and reach a larger and more global audience then they could reach on their own. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way of recognizing the importance of these institutions and the NBA is saying, yes, these institutions are important to America and we wanted to make that known,\u201d said Williams. \u201cAnd we made it very clear that the biggest need right now, for our students is scholarships, so we will take the dollars that we generate from the NBA All-Star Game and give it directly to our students. And it will have an impact on them persisting towards graduation.\u201d \u201cTo have the All-Stars shining a bright light on the needs of people who all too often don\u2019t have their story told and remain in the shadows that they\u2019re bright light and their encouragement and their support and their attention are going to mean the world to them,\u201d added Lomax. And even when the final buzzer sounds on Sunday night, the NBA and NBPA will remain committed to advocating for these individuals, schools and causes. The NBA family will continue to take collective action to advance social justice, including through the NBA Foundation , National Basketball Social Justice Coalition , civic engagement, voting access and awareness, and more. This weekend and beyond, it\u2019ll be bigger than basketball."},{"id":505077,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-will-be-short-handed-when-they-return-to-floor","date":"2021-03-03","title":"Raptors will be short-handed when they return to floor","content":"The Toronto Raptors will have enough players to get back on the floor Wednesday, after a pair of games earlier this week were postponed for virus-related issues. But the Raptors will be seriously short-handed when they host the Detroit Pistons in Tampa, Florida \u2014 with starters Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby all ruled out in accordance with the league\u2019s health and safety protocols, along with Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw. Also still out: coach Nick Nurse, who entered the protocols last week along with five other members of his staff. Assistant coach Sergio Scariolo, who led Toronto to a win in its most recent game on Friday, will remain in the acting-coach role on Wednesday. \u201cWe will try to do our best for the guys who won\u2019t be able to be with us tomorrow,\u201d said Scariolo, who has been in contact with Nurse regularly throughout this process. The Raptors were able to do some on-court work Tuesday but have had \u201cmultiple days of no new cases,\u201d general manager Bobby Webster said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple of days,\u201d Webster said. \u201cTo get to here and be able to practice, we had to clear a number of hurdles.\u201d Toronto has two games left before the All-Star break, with the Wednesday game against Detroit to be followed by a Thursday matchup at Boston. Webster indicated that the players who will be sidelined Wednesday aren\u2019t expected back Thursday. The Raptors\u2019 games against Chicago on Sunday and Detroit on Tuesday were pushed back, bringing the league\u2019s total number of games moved because at least one team would not have enough players eligible to play this season to 31. The Wednesday game between Toronto and Detroit is a makeup of the Tuesday contest. \u201cIt\u2019s what you can imagine,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIt\u2019s the emotional stress of having colleagues that potentially, obviously, can be sick. The enormous amount of stress everyone feels, everyone\u2019s walking a bit on eggshells here in the locker room and you can\u2019t necessarily be as friendly. \u2026 The basketball will go on, we\u2019ll play the games, but just to maintain everybody\u2019s belonging and familiarity is really important.\u201d The only teams that have not had a game postponed by virus issues so far this season are Brooklyn, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers. But the Lakers had an issue appear on their injury report Tuesday, when they ruled center Marc Gasol out for their game against Phoenix because of the protocols. And the New York Knicks lost Derrick Rose for Tuesday\u2019s game, placing him on the protocols list for their game in San Antonio about an hour before that contest was to start. Entering the protocols can mean any number of things, including but not limited to a positive test, an inconclusive test or contact tracing suggesting possible exposure to a person positive for COVID-19. The roster hits to the Raptors are significant. VanVleet and Siakam are tied for Toronto\u2019s team lead in scoring at 20.1 points per game, and Anunoby is averaging 13.8 points. VanVleet was also the only Toronto player to start all 34 of the team\u2019s games this season. The Raptors called up a pair of reinforcements from their Raptors 905 team in the G League bubble in nearby Lake Buena Vista, Florida \u2014 bringing in Jalen Harris and Donta Hall for Wednesday."},{"id":504960,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-kawhi-leonard-scratched-due-to-back-spasms","date":"2021-03-03","title":"Kawhi Leonard sits out Celtics matchup due to back spasms","content":"The LA Clippers played Tuesday\u2019s showdown with the Boston Celtics without All-Star Kawhi Leonard, who sat out the game due to back spasms.

Even then, McMillan didn\u2019t rest easy. He immediately felt the burden of his increased responsibility. \u201cThe sleepless nights have already started,\u201d McMillan said Tuesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a wink of sleep last night.\u201d McMillan said before his debut as interim coach in Tuesday night\u2019s game at Miami that he initially wasn\u2019t interested when Hawks president Travis Schlenk extended the offer to serve as interim coach. McMillan, who was fired last year following four seasons as the Indiana Pacers coach, said he wasn\u2019t looking for another opportunity to lead a team when he agreed to serve on Pierce\u2019s staff. Even as others saw McMillan as the logical successor for Pierce, he had other ideas. He didn\u2019t expect Pierce to be fired and wasn\u2019t ready to take over the Hawks. \u201cThe thought process at first was that wasn\u2019t something I really was going to do, because it was really a surprise to me,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWhen I spoke with Travis about that I told him that wasn\u2019t what I came here for.\u201d Pierce helped to convince McMillan to accept the interim job. \u201cWe had a conversation about the team and the move \u2026 and he just felt he didn\u2019t think this would happen but he felt I could step in and do a good job with the team,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cHe basically felt I should take this opportunity.\u201d So about three hours after announcing Pierce had been fired, the Hawks named McMillan as interim coach later Monday. McMillan, 56, played 12 years in the NBA with Seattle and has logged 16 seasons, posting a 661-588 record, as a head coach with Seattle, Portland and Indiana. Even with so much experience, he was caught off-guard by the unexpected opportunity to revive the Hawks\u2019 disappointing season. He wasn\u2019t ready to talk about the possibility of being more than an interim coach in Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m going to take this \u2014 and you guys are going to hear me say this as much as you ask \u2014 one game at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on tonight\u2019s game, not tomorrow\u2019s game. So far as the future and what I\u2019m looking for, I really haven\u2019t thought about that. There was no conversation about that with Travis and I.\u201d The Hawks were 14-20 and 11th in the Eastern Conference entering Tuesday night\u2019s game. Schlenk said he believes McMillan is the right choice to revive the season. \u201cI think Nate\u2019s resume speaks for itself,\u201d Schlenk said Monday. \u201cI have a ton of confidence in Nate moving forward.\u201d Atlanta was expected to end its three-year playoff drought this season. Pierce was limited by injuries which forced De\u2019Andre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari and others to miss extended stretches of games. One offseason addition, Kris Dunn, still has not played this season. McMillan said he believes the Hawks have enough talent to make it to the playoffs. \u201cI think we are capable of doing some good things here,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWe certainly need to get healthy, but yes. \u2026 We\u2019ve just got to show that growth, show that improvement and get it done.\u201d McMillan said he won\u2019t have an opportunity before this week\u2019s All-Star break to make any significant changes. He wouldn\u2019t say what moves he plans to make but said he still believes in the team. He also said he still believes in Pierce. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in coach Pierce,\u201d he said. \u201cHe sold me on his plan and I wanted to be on board to come down and try to help him make a difference.\u201d"},{"id":504849,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/quin-snyder-steve-nash-named-nba-coaches-of-the-month","date":"2021-03-02","title":"Quin Snyder, Steve Nash named NBA Coaches of the Month","content":"Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder and Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash have been named the NBA Western and Eastern Conference Coach of the Month, respectively, for February.

The Knicks are rolling and currently sit firmly in the playoff picture thanks in part to Rose\u2019s strong play since joining the team. This is a pace-up spot for the Knicks and a favorable defensive matchup to boot. Fire up Rose as one of the night\u2019s best values. Kendrick Nunn (PG \u2013 MIA) : $5,800 vs ATL Even with Goran Dragic back in action, Nunn has kept producing. Across his last five, Nunn has scored better than 20 points and 44 FD points three times. Tonight\u2019s matchup with Atlanta is about as friendly as it gets, and Nunn would get an even bigger boost in value if Jimmy Butler sits. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS) : $5,800 vs NYK Poeltl has averaged 10 points, 10 boards, and 2.7 blocks since his insertion into the starting five, and despite the return of LaMarcus Aldridge, Poeltl has remained a fixture in San Antonio\u2019s starting lineup. He gets a favorable matchup with the Knicks tonight, where he could easily outperform his modest $5.8K price tag. Bobby Portis (PF \u2013 MIL) : $5,600 vs DEN Bobby P is typically priced as a value on most slates, and tonight is no different. Milwaukee\u2019s matchup with Denver boasts a 236 over\/under, which means there will be plenty of opportunities for Portis to rack up fantasy points. Denver\u2019s frontcourt rotation is thin aside from Nikola Jokic, and Portis should be able to take advantage and provide solid value at just $5.6K. Kevin Huerter (SG \u2013 ATL) : $5,300 at MIA Huerter has logged heavy minutes on the wing for Atlanta as of late, making the most of his opportunities with injuries to Cam Reddish, De\u2019Andre Hunter, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Over his last four games, Huerter has scored at least 37 FD points twice and logged a game with four steals and one with six. I have no problem paying $5.3K for for a guy with 40-point upside. Davis Bertans (PF \u2013 WAS) : $5,000 vs MEM It\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride for those rostering Bertans in season-long leagues and especially for those taking a shot on him in DFS lineups. Still, when he gets hot from downtown, he can return value in spades. On the year, Memphis ranks in the bottom-10 in both 3-pointers allowed and 3-point percentage allowed. Bertans is worth a look at just $5K. Justise Winslow (SF \u2013 MEM) : $4,400 at WAS If you\u2019re looking to spend way down for a guy who can return a ton of value, you can certainly justify rolling with Winslow. In just his fourth game of the season, Winslow went for 29.6 FD points over 20 minutes Sunday against Houston. With Kyle Anderson a GTD tonight, Winslow could be looking at more minutes in a matchup with Washington that sports a 237 over\/under."},{"id":504734,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/canada-goose-and-nba-announce-multiyear-partnership","date":"2021-03-02","title":"Canada Goose And NBA Announce Multiyear Partnership","content":"TORONTO, ON, March 2, 2021 \u2013 Today, Canada Goose announced a multiyear partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that makes Canada Goose a Proud Outerwear Partner of NBA All-Star.

About RHUDE R H U D E, founded by Rhuigi Villase\u00f1or in 2015, is a design venture born out of Los Angeles, balancing luxury techniques with streetwear elements, showcased as ready-to-wear collections. Designed from a narrative standpoint R H U D E is both a reflection of modern socioeconomics and personal stories as Villase\u00f1or came to Los Angeles from the Philippines at the age of 11 with no concept of brand culture. Now a reoccurring theme season-to-season, RHUDE combines American iconography with nostalgic references, a visual commentary on Los Angeles style and culture itself. Rhuigi studied art history shortly after graduating high school and was an understudy\/intern to Shaun Samson. With no formal training specific to fashion design, Villase\u00f1or credits his understanding of garments and construction to growing up with a mother who was a tailor, providing a foundation and understanding of how to build each piece and the subsequent stories told with each collection. RHUDE\u2019s journey parallels Villase\u00f1or, chronicling the evolution of a man from adolescence to maturity, a narrative reflected in each collection, both the Creative Director and brand continue to grow-up with its ever-expanding fan base."},{"id":504702,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/defensive-player-ladder-ben-simmons-steals-no-1-spot","date":"2021-03-02","title":"Defensive Player Ladder: Ben Simmons steals No. 1 spot","content":"Ben Simmons hasn\u2019t climbed to the top rung of the Defensive Player Ladder simply by speaking it into existence. He did so by earning it on the court for the Philadelphia 76ers \u2013 and then talking about himself as the NBA\u2019s best defensive player. In mid-February, after some stellar defensive work against Portland Kia MVP candidate Damian Lillard, Simmons said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-off thing. If you watch me, I\u2019m typically guarding the best player. \u2026 I feel like I\u2019m the best defender in the NBA.\u201d Two weeks later, it was Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic getting stymied in the minutes Simmons matched up with him. Doncic shrugged it off \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to who\u2019s on me\u201d \u2013 but Simmons didn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s a mismatch nearly every time when I step on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI do feel like I\u2019m the best defensive player in the league.\u201d If it\u2019s versatility on defense you favor, if it\u2019s the ability of one man to lock onto and lock down everyone from point guards to power forwards \u2013 or what used to be known as that before this era of so-called \u201cposition-less basketball\u201d \u2013 then Simmons probably is your man. He can focus on (as part of coach Doc Rivers\u2019 defensive game plan) or switch onto (in the heat of a Sixers defensive possession) at least 80 percent of the players in the NBA. And the pride he takes in those tasks go well beyond self-promotion, contributing to Philadelphia\u2019s climb this season in defensive and net ratings. Rivers recently compared Simmons to a starting pitcher and a closer in baseball for his ability to pester top scorers from tipoff or throw a net on a problem player down the stretch. \u201cBen is a chameleon,\u201d the Sixers coach said. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared to put him on 1 through 5 on needed possessions.\u201d Across the first half of this season, according to NBA.com stats, Simmons has been the primary defender on the opponent\u2019s top scorer 11 times for nine different players. That includes threats such as Lillard, Doncic, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell and LeBron James. In Thursday\u2019s game against the Mavericks, Simmons guarded Doncic for 7:28, more than 70 percent of Doncic\u2019s offensive-matchup time. He held the Dallas star to six points on 3-of-7 shooting, including 0-of-3 from the arc. He forced four turnovers to just one assist. (Matchup numbers between players can be found here . In the dropdown, change traditional to matchups.) That\u2019s All-Star defense \u2013 maybe Kia Defensive Player of the Year defense \u2013 producing something less than All-Star offense. Teammate Dwight Howard, a three-time DPOY winner, gushed afterward about the point guard who can stand eye-to-eye with him. \u201cA couple games ago, he was playing against Rudy Gobert, and now he\u2019s playing against Luka,\u201d Howard said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken the idea that \u2018I can play anybody,\u2019 that \u2018I can check anybody on defense.\u2019\u201d With his flip-flop atop this week\u2019s Defensive Ladder, Simmons has worked and campaigned himself to the No. 1 spot, with half a season to go. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Monday, March 1.) Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2  Even when things don\u2019t go well for the Sixers\u2019 defense, Simmons seems to do his part. Rivers blistered the team\u2019s transition D after its overtime loss to Cleveland last weekend, in which Cavs guards Collin Sexton and Darius Garland combined for 53 points. But when Simmons was matched up with them, they managed just eight of those, per NBA.com stats. Simmons is tied for the league lead in deflections (3.9) and loose balls recovered (1.4), and his net rating (14.0) over the past week was better than Gobert\u2019s (11.3). Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1  We covered the hamburger vs. hot dog nature of NBA defense last week \u2014 there are perimeter defenders and there are rim protectors, and it\u2019s all a matter of your taste or need. The Jazz big man still is the class of the latter, and his team wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Never mind that he rarely is called on to guard an opponent\u2019s top scorer. Gobert stifles and discourages entire offenses with his presence and help. Utah is 14.4 points better in the 30.5 minutes he\u2019s on the floor, including 7.8 points better defensively. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Right behind Gobert in rim protection, the Pacers\u2019 6-foot-11 center has been facing 17.9 shot attempts per game and bothering the shooters into 41.8 percent accuracy (remember, these are largely 2-pointers). That\u2019s 6.7 percent better than what those players normally shoot. Indiana ranks third in blocked shots and Turner accounts for 72.2 percent of them. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 The Lakers still boast the league\u2019s top defensive rating (105.1), with Anthony Davis sidelined since Valentine\u2019s Day, and rank in the Top 5 in blocks, defensive rebounds, opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage, opponents\u2019 free throw attempts and opponents\u2019 effective field-goal percentage. James leads the NBA in defensive win shares (0.178) and ranks fourth in defensive rating (102.6), with a 9.2 net rating. Last week\u2019s ranking: N\/A If it\u2019s perimeter defense you want, you might want to pay attention to Murray. The Denver guard is responsible for closing out on 6.8 shots per game of 15 feet or more, and his impact on those shooters is great. Normally accurate 37.7 percent of the time from that range, Murray has them down at 28.8 percent, a gain of 8.9 percent. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But \u201clocked in\u201d are the two words you hear most these days when talking to the players, and Ayton\u2019s description of what the term means to him provides a sense of the culture of accountability the Suns have built in Year 2 of the coach Monty Williams era. \u201cJust knowing the type of dude I am, knowing the expectations and knowing the responsibility every night, there is no [room for] hiccups, really,\u201d Ayton said last Monday after Phoenix\u2019s 132-100 win against the Blazers on Feb. 22. \u201cIf I gave you the secrets, I think every team would want to use it. So, I can\u2019t give you the secret. I\u2019ll just give you the general, serious basics of just keeping each other accountable, being on top of each other, your teammates expecting more from you than your coach, playing alongside your brother and knowing you have a brother for life when you\u2019re coming out here playing hard every game. It\u2019s just all that stuff that we are locked in on this team, where it\u2019s beyond basketball.\u201d Whatever it is, Phoenix seems to relish it as a catalyst to running off 11 wins in its last 13 outings. The Suns head into tonight\u2019s matchup against the Lakers on the heels of Devin Booker reeling off a season-high 43 points Sunday in a 118-99 victory over the Timberwolves. But let\u2019s go back to Feb. 19, when Chris Paul picked apart the Pelicans with 19 assists on the way to an 11-point, fourth-quarter comeback in the Suns\u2019 132-114 victory. Three nights prior at home, Phoenix surrendered a 24-point lead against Brooklyn that proved critical in breaking the team\u2019s six-game winning streak. The Nets torched Phoenix in the comeback, as Landry Shamet, Jeff Green and James Harden alternated taking Ayton to the hole for buckets as the Suns produced their worst defensive fourth-quarter performance of the season. Against the Pelicans, though, Phoenix pulled off a complete 180 by outscoring the opposition 41-12 in the final period. Phoenix forced seven New Orleans turnovers, and converted those into 14 points to finish the final frame with a defensive rating of 52.2 , which translates to just 12 points on 23 possessions. That fourth-quarter performance ranked as Phoenix\u2019s best of the season in the final frame. \u201cWhen you look at that New Orleans game, it was our defense that allowed for us to get out in transition,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cI think our offense has just been a byproduct of us being able to get stops and rebounds.\u201d It\u2019s certainly working as Phoenix enters tonight\u2019s matchup against the Lakers ranked fourth in points allowed per game (107.5), tied for fourth in defensive rating (108.5), eighth in offensive rating (115.0) and third in net rating (+5.9). \u201cI think that fourth quarter in New Orleans, I think we talked to each other and communicated a lot,\u201d Booker said. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s been really effective for us. Obviously, it\u2019s not always gonna be like this. We\u2019re not gonna make all of our shots. But defense is something that we can rely on.\u201d Williams pointed to Mikal Bridges as a significant contributor to Phoenix\u2019s improvement on defense because of his ability to consistently guard the opponent\u2019s most dynamic offensive threats. \u201cA lot of times, [with] his length, he gets his hands on a lot of balls or he forces a lot of hang-time passes because he is long. And on the backside, our guys can get steals or deflections,\u201d Williams said. Paul also heaped praise on Bridges for his defensive effort. \u201cMikal is the guy who has the hardest defensive assignment every night,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo, we want to know his feedback. What do you like? How would you like to guard this? It\u2019s really been a lot of fun.\u201d They\u2019re communicating heavily in the prep department, too. Case in point: Wednesday morning\u2019s shootaround ahead of the matchup against Charlotte. Paul spent a few minutes talking with Suns assistant Brian Randle as they pored over the Hornets scouting report before finding Booker as they walked off the court. \u201cI think I told Book: \u2018One thing about us, is we\u2019re always gonna be prepared,\u2019 \u201d Paul said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a credit to our coaching staff, how they pay attention to detail, and they allow us to speak up.\u201d How far the work takes the Suns is up to them. Williams remains \u201chopeful\u201d that Phoenix \u201ccan continue to grow\u201d and reach \u201ca level or two\u201d in terms of improvement. But he laughed behind the face mask Sunday when hearing that in a postgame interview, Booker quoted one of the coach\u2019s favorite sayings in pointing out that Phoenix can\u2019t afford to \u201cget happy on the farm.\u201d So, in preparing for the Lakers, Williams plans to spend the team\u2019s next film session focused on Phoenix\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cYou get happy on the farm because of a few things; you\u2019re scoring the ball, you\u2019re winning a few games, whatever the case may be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get bored with being efficient. We can\u2019t get bored with getting stops. We understand that right now they\u2019re the standard. They\u2019re the champions. So, we know we have to bring a great effort and execution.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

Big guys. Tough guys. Like Shaq. O\u2019Neal is set to perform in his first competitive match when he teams in All Elite Wrestling with Jade Cargill in a mixed tag to take on Cody Rhodes and Red Velvet at Daily\u2019s Place in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cDynamite.\u201d The seeds for a feud were set up last November when Cargill appeared on \u201cDynamite\u201d and trash-talked Rhodes that O\u2019Neal was the real giant-killer of pro wrestling. O\u2019Neal responded on \u201cInside the NBA\u201d and told Rhodes to name the place. \u201cI\u2019m the type, I can never back down from a challenge,\u201d O\u2019Neal told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m not a professional wrestler, but I\u2019ve been in a match before. I\u2019ve got a lot of moves in my arsenal. When you step inside somebody\u2019s world, you have to stick to what you\u2019re masterful at. I\u2019m not acrobatic. I\u2019m not going to be jumping off the ropes. I\u2019m coming with the power game. When I get hands on him, I\u2019m going to display this power.\u201d O\u2019Neal visited the wrestling-training facility Nightmare Factory in the Norcross, Georgia, but has otherwise limited professional wrestling training. \u201cI\u2019m the type that if I have a look and see you do it, I got it,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. O\u2019Neal was crushed as a teenager when Hulk Hogan slammed and defeated Andre the Giant in the main event of WrestleMania III. Once he became an NBA star, Shaq Diesel \u2014 a nickname made for pro wrestling \u2014- eventually had a word with the Hulkster. \u201cI told him, \u2018you broke my heart when you body-slammed Andre the Giant,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI cried as a kid. I really did.\u201d All was \u2014 mostly \u2014 forgiven seven years later in 1994 when Hogan beat Ric Flair at Bash at the Beach and celebrated with O\u2019Neal. O\u2019Neal has been as well traveled inside the squared circle as some of his favorite stars. He stood side-by-very-large-side with Hogan in both World Championship Wrestling and Impact Wrestling, and even competed in the Andre the Giant battle royal at WrestleMania in 2016. O\u2019Neal, who boxed Shane Mosley in 2010, stared down the 7-foot Big Show in WWE\u2019s battle royal before they teamed up to double choke-slam Kane. The remaining wrestlers conspired to toss O\u2019Neal over the ropes and eliminate him from the match. \u201cI wanted to get my hands on the Big Show,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. O\u2019Neal might get his chance after Show left WWE after a 20-plus year stint there and is set to make his AEW debut on Wednesday. What a coincidence! The 48-year-old O\u2019Neal, who won four NBA titles over his Hall of Fame career, is the latest in a long line of active and retired athletes who wrestled in attraction matches. Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone wrestled for WCW in the 1990s, Lawrence Taylor wrestled in the main event of WrestleMania XI, and Mike Tyson has made appearances for WWE and AEW. \u201cThis one will top them all,\u201d O\u2019Neal said."},{"id":509088,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nike-earned-edition-jersey-denver-nuggets","date":"2021-03-02","title":"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Denver Nuggets","content":"The Denver Nuggets secured the third-best record in the Western Conference during the 2019-20 season, finishing 46-27.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. T. J. McConnell (PG\/SG \u2013 IND): 44% rostered Man, what\u2019s a guy have to do to get some respect in the fantasy streets? I left that sentence in from last week\u2019s piece. His roster percentage only went up eight percent. People don\u2019t need assists and defensive stats? UPDATE: I haven\u2019t edited the first sentence in three weeks. The roster percentage increased five percent from last week, so one or two more weeks, and hopefully I won\u2019t have to write him up anymore. It\u2019s madness, I tell ya! Over the last five games, McConnell has been a top-50 player. He\u2019s averaged 33.6 minutes, 11.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, two steals, and 0.8 blocks. 0.8 blocks! Danny Green (SG\/SF \u2013 PHI): 25% rostered Green is the antithesis of fantasy sexy, but over the last four games, he\u2019s been a top-25 player! Crazy, I know. He\u2019s been averaging four steals per game. That\u2019s obviously not the New World Order. Green is more like a top 100-ish player who can provide 3-pointers, some rebounds, and defensive stats. The shooting efficiency is always an issue, though, as he\u2019s converting 40% of his attempts on the season. Saddiq Bey (SF \u2013 DET): 46% rostered Bey has started the last eight games and will likely start the remainder of the season as the Pistons have shelved Blake Griffin. Over the last seven games, Bey has been a top-55 player, averaging 32.5 minutes, 13.3 points, 3.1 3-pointers, 5.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and 1.4 steals while shooting 45% from the field. His usage rate has been 16.9. Derrick Jones Jr. (SG\/SF \u2013 POR): 30% rostered If you\u2019re looking for offense, there\u2019s nothing to see here. That said, Jones has been shooting 63% from the field, good for 11.4 points per game over the last seven games. Jones is a rebounds and defensive stat-stuffer who will also provide some 3-pointers. Over that seven-game span, he has averaged one 3-pointer, 6.1 rebounds, 0.6 steals, and two blocks per game. Malik Monk (PG\/SG \u2013 CHA): 28% rostered Monk has been on quite the heater recently. Over the last three games, he garnered a 30.7 usage rate and averaged 24.7 points, 4.7 3-pointers, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists while shooting 53% from the field in 25.8 minutes. He\u2019s been benefitting from injuries and the shooting efficiency will regress, but chant with Monk for as long as it lasts. Dennis Smith Jr. (PG \u2013 DET): 17% rostered Smith Jr. has started the last four games, and he played 27 and 26 minutes in the last two. His usage rate has been 23 and 20, and he\u2019s contributed double-digit points with six and seven assists. The shooting efficiency is always a concern with Smith Jr., as he\u2019s shooting 38% from the field on the season. The turnover rate is very low and he does contribute some defensive stats. Most importantly, he has the faith of Dwane Casey, at least for now. When Killian Hayes returns to action, Smith Jr. will likely go back to the bench, but enjoy the roller coaster ride for now. Jalen Brunson (PG\/SG \u2013 DAL): 25% rostered Over the last seven games, Brunson has played 30, 23, 34, 28, 30, 23, and 27 minutes, despite not starting at all. He\u2019s scored double figures in every one of the games and contributed a little something in every category but blocks. He has kept the turnovers low (1.5) while maintaining excellent percentages (54% from the field and 81% from the line). Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS): 47% rostered Poeltl has started the last eight games, including the most recent two with LaMarcus Aldridge in the lineup. He has averaged over 30 minutes per game and has played 35 and 25 in the two games with Aldridge. There is some uncertainty as to how it all plays out going forward, but for now, the two will likely play alongside each other. As a result, Poeltl should continue to be an excellent source of rebounds and blocks. Over the last 11 games, he has averaged 8.8 rebounds with 2.5 blocks."},{"id":504181,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-relieve-lloyd-pierce-of-head-coaching-duties","date":"2021-03-01","title":"Hawks relieve Lloyd Pierce of coaching duties, name McMillan interim head coach","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce was fired on Monday following a disappointing start to a season of heightened expectations. Hawks president Travis Schlenk announced the move in a short statement released by the team. The Hawks are 14-20 and 11th in the Eastern Conference, following a 109-99 loss at Miami on Sunday night. The teams play again in Miami on Tuesday. \u201cWe would like to thank Lloyd for his work and commitment to not only the Hawks organization but the city of Atlanta,\u201d Schlenk said in the statement. The Hawks shortly announced that that assistant coach Nate McMillan had been named interim head coach of the team. Schlenk said the move, which comes less than a week before Atlanta hosts the All-Star Game, is timed to help the team enjoy a second-half resurgence. \u201cWe have high expectations for our team on the court and we believe by making this change now that we can have a strong second half of the season,\u201d Schlenk said. The Hawks last appeared in the playoffs in 2017. The team has rebuilt around point guard Trae Young and forward John Collins and invested heavily in veterans in the offseason. Key additions include Bogdan Bogdanovic, Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn. The Hawks\u2019 talent also received a major upgrade with the addition of center Clint Capela. The Hawks had free-agent money to spend, and Schlenk wasted no time in adding Gallinari (three years, $61.5 million), Rondo (two years, $15 million) and Dunn (two years, $10 million). The biggest move came when Schlenk made Bogdanovic an offer \u2014 four years for $72 million \u2014 the Sacramento Kings didn\u2019t match. Injuries to Bogdanovic and others have prevented Pierce from having a healthy roster, however. The Hawks\u2019 progress also has been hurt by the loss of emerging star De\u2019Andre Hunter to knee surgery. McMillan filled in for Pierce when Piece was recently away from the team while his wife was giving birth. The former NBA point guard joined the Hawks coaching staff on Nov. 11, 2020. As head coach with Seattle (2000-05), Portland (2005-12) and Indiana (2016-20), McMillan led his teams to a 661-588 (.529) mark in 1,249 career regular season games and has 53 games of postseason coaching experience. Last season, the Pacers finished 45-28 (.616), second in the Central Division and fourth in the Eastern Conference. In his four years with Indiana, the club recorded a 183-136 mark (.574), advancing to the playoffs each season. Pierce, hired in 2018, was 63-120 (.344) with the Hawks, missing the playoffs in each of his two completed seasons."},{"id":504163,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/giannis-antetokounmpo-devin-booker-named-nba-players-of-the-week","date":"2021-03-01","title":"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker named NBA Players of the Week","content":"Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker have been named the NBA Players of the Week for Week 10.

Bucks-Clippers on Sunday didn\u2019t have a game-winner (Giannis Antetokounmpo put Milwaukee ahead with a pair of free throws with 1:57 left), but it was still a great game between two of the best teams in the league. As messed up as this season has been, those can still bring us joy. Through Sunday, 50% of games (251\/501) have been within five points in the last five minutes, just a tick down from last season (51%). There have been some huge margins of victory (the latest of those coming on Sunday in Memphis ), but success or failure in close games can still make or break your season. Just ask the the Toronto Raptors, who are 7-12 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes , but 10-5 otherwise. The Denver Nuggets are in a similar boat in the Western Conference at 6-9 in games that were within five in the last five and 12-6 otherwise. If we counted only the games that weren\u2019t close, the Raptors would be the No. 3 seed in the East and the Nuggets would be tied for fourth in the West. The Utah Jazz (19-2) would still have the best record in the league, but the Milwaukee Bucks (17-5) would be comfortably atop the East. Instead of being the No. 6 seed at 18-14, the Blazers would be in 10th place at 6-9. Of course, it doesn\u2019t work that way. Point differential can inform, but it doesn\u2019t actually count for anything. The ability to execute down the stretch of close games is a skill that matters. The Jazz lost a close one in Miami on Friday, but remain at the top of the rankings for a third straight week, with a marquee game in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

Quick math puts him projected right under 40 FanDuel points and 5X value. With that being said, I still see him able to reach a ceiling of 55 points, and he is so consistent that 5X value is almost a floor game. I expect people to shy away from owning him, seeing that he plays Utah, so he is good for cash and GPP lineups. Collin Sexton (SG \u2013 CLE) at HOU $7,100 Sexton\u2019s usage has increased as of late, reaching 30% or higher in three of his last four games. He has shown his ability to play 40 minutes, and while I expect him to play between 36-38, the Rockets offer a great option for a ceiling game. Cleveland played Houston on Feb. 24, a game in which Sexton scored 23 points in 38 minutes. He should see an increase in assists and rebounds tonight. T.J. McConnell (PG \u2013 IND) at PHI $6,100 Malcolm Brogdon missed the last game with a knee injury, and McConnell played 46 minutes, posting 45.2 fantasy points. If Brogdon misses tonight\u2019s game \u2014 he is currently questionable \u2014 McConnell is a must in your lineups, whether in GPP or cash. He can easily return 6X value or more and the 76ers have surprisingly struggled against point guards, allowing the 24th most FanDuel points per game. Jordan Clarkson (SG \u2013 UTA) at NOP $5,900 The leading Kia Sixth Man of the Year candidate, Clarkson has been one of the more consistent producers of late. With his price staying below $6k, he consistently offers great value and tonight is no different. The Pelicans\u2019 defense is one of the NBA\u2019s worst and Clarkson should see the floor for 30 minutes, making him one of the better value options on the slate. LaMarcus Aldridge (PF \u2013 SAS) vs. BKN $5,600  After missing six games, Aldridge\u2019s first two games back were pretty solid. In his last game, he scored 30 FanDuel points in 23 minutes. He should only see an uptick in minutes, and the Nets provide a great matchup for him to return solid value. Keldon Johnson is questionable tomorrow, so Aldridge has the chance to start. If that\u2019s the case, Aldridge will be an incredible value. Even with Johnson in, I expect him to do well. Eric Gordon (SG \u2013 HOU) vs. CLE $5,300 If John Wall gets ruled out on the back-to-back, Eric Gordon offers the slate\u2019s best value. Gordon isn\u2019t exactly the most consistent player, but he produces upwards of 25 FanDuel points when the minutes are there. I see 25 fantasy points as a floor game for Gordon if Wall is out, and he has the potential to reach 40+. The Cavaliers offer a great matchup for Gordon to go off as well. Gordon would be very high-owned if no Wall but would essentially be a cash game lock. DeAndre Jordan (C \u2013 BKN) at SAS $4,700 Keep an eye out for lineup news because Jeff Green can earn the start over Jordan, but Green is questionable as well. If Jordan does start, he is an outstanding contrarian option for tonight. There are many solid pay-up options at center tonight, so Jordan is a great way to diversify your GPP lineups. His ceiling is a bit limited as he doesn\u2019t garner much usage, but he should return solid value and isn\u2019t that risky. Danuel House (SF \u2013 HOU) vs. CLE $4,500 If Wall is out, a lot more usage opens up for House. Even if Wall plays, House has carved a solid role for himself. He has started his last six games and is hovering just shy of a 20% usage rate. However, his minutes and production are inconsistent. At $4,500, he is at a nice price to allow you to spend up elsewhere. Michael Carter-Williams (PG \u2013 ORL) vs. DAL $4,400 For any starter, $4,400 is too cheap a price. The Mavericks defense is not great and should allow MCW to reach between 5X-6X value. I don\u2019t trust him enough to put in cash lineups, but he is a real solid leverage GPP play, as I don\u2019t imagine Carter-Williams to garner that much ownership tonight. Patty Mills (PG \u2013 SAS) vs. BKN $3,900 For someone who played 30 minutes last time out, $3900 is an incredible price. Mills isn\u2019t the best producer when on the floor, at about 0.70 fantasy points per minute, but the Nets are up-tempo, which will give Mills more looks against their below-average defense. Mills should reach between 5X-6X and is viable in both cash and GPP lineups tonight."},{"id":504000,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-nba-tv-monday-march-1-2021","date":"2021-03-01","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: NBA TV Monday, March 1, 2021","content":"8 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 Utah leads the season series with New Orleans 2-0, winning both games on the road by double digits. Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 32 points per game on 58.8% (20-34) shooting from the field, 66.7% (10-15) from 3-point range and 14-14 from the free throw line. Rudy Gobert averaged 12.5 points, 14.5 rebounds and 3.5 blocks. \u2022 Zion Williamson has averaged 29.5 points on 69.7% (23-33) shooting in two games against the Jazz. Bojan Bogdanovic was the primary defender on Williamson for a team-high 11:19 of matchup time. Williamson scored 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting from the field against Bodganovic over the two games. \u2022 Williamson leads the NBA in points in the paint at 19.3 ppg, which accounts for 75.5% of his 25.5 points per game. Free throws account for the the next 22.1% of Williamson\u2019s points , followed by 2.2% on 3-pointers and 0.2% on mid-range shots. Zion has attempted only four mid-range shots all season, \u2022 The Jazz attempt the second-most wide-open shots of any team in the league at 24.6 per game; their 63.4 effective field goal percentage on those wide-open shots ranks third in the league. The Pelicans rank 29th in wide-open look at just 16.3 per game; while they rank 10th in eFG% on those shots, they do not generate enough of them. \u2022 Gobert ranks second in the league in screen assists (6.5 per game) with those screens generating 15.9 points per game for the Jazz. Utah leads the NBA in scoring by the ball handler in pick-and-roll plays (24.9 ppg). Mitchell (9.4 ppg) and Mike Conley (7.5 ppg) rank eighth and 19th , respectively, in scoring as the ball handier in pick-and-rolls this season. Boston is the only other team with two players ranked in the top 20. 10:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 LaMelo Ball ranks 13th in the league in deflections (3.1 per game) and ninth in steals (1.5 per game). The Hornets rank second in points off turnovers (19.7 per game). However, the Blazers are one of the top teams in terms of ball security with am 11.6 turnover percentage and just 14.9 points off turnovers allowed \u2014 ranked second-best in both categories. \u2022 One glaring difference between these two teams comes in assist percentage. The Hornets rank third with 66% of their baskets coming off an assist, while the Blazers rank 30th as the only team with fewer than half of their baskets coming off an assist. The Hornets average 308.6 passes per game (second in NBA), while the Blazers average just 244.7 (last in NBA). \u2022 The Hornets are coming off a thrilling last-minute comeback-win over the Kings on Sunday night as they erased an eight-point deficit in the final 53 seconds to steal the win. This will be Charlotte\u2019s eighth game on the second night of a back-to-back. So far this season, the Hornets are 4-3 in those games and averaged 113.1 points per game. \u2022 Damian Lillard ranks second in the NBA in clutch scoring with 82 points on 24-for-40 (60%) shooting from the field, 10-for-18 (55.6%) from 3-point range and 24-for-24 from the free throw line in close games down the stretch. Portland\u2019s 12-5 record in clutch games is tied with the Lakers for the second-best mark the league behind Philadelphia. \u2022 Both the Hornets and Blazers shoot 38.1% on 3-point shots this season \u2013 separated by a fraction of a percentage point for seventh and eighth place in the NBA. A key difference is frequency; the Blazers rank second in the NBA in both 3-pointers made (16.0) and attempted (42.1) this season, while the Hornets rank eighth in 3-pointers made (13.8) and 11th in attempts (36.3)."},{"id":503992,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-league-pass-games-to-watch-week-11","date":"2021-03-01","title":"NBA League Pass Games to Watch: Week 11","content":"\u2022 Watch live games with NBA League Pass > 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Nets are 15-7 since James Harden made his debut with the team on Jan. 16.

In those games, they are 9-3 overall and 7-2 when it is the combo of Irving and Harden playing together. 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass It\u2019s round two between Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 two of the league\u2019s most dominant and unique superstars. Giannis and the Bucks won the first meeting with the Nuggets, 125-112 on Feb. 8 , behind 30 points and nine rebounds from the two-time reigning Kia MVP and 30 points and a career-best 12 assists from Khris Middleton. Jokic stuffed the stat sheet with a game-high 35 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in 39 minutes, but the Bucks outscored the Nuggets 66-50 in the second half to earn the win. Giannis got the best of the individual matchup with Jokic when the two defended one another. In 1:30 of matchup time with Jokic defending Giannis, Giannis scored 13 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field, 2-for-3 from 3-point range and 3-for-4 from the free throw line. In 1:05 of matchup time with Giannis defending Jokic, Jokic had four points on 2-for-6 shooting from the field and had three of his shots blocked. Jokic and the Nuggets will have their hands full with Giannis, who has scored at least 35 points in each of his past four games \u2014 the longest streak in the NBA this season. 7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Anytime we get a matchup of the teams with the top records in each conference , it has to make the must-watch list. The Sixers lead the Eastern Conference at 22-12, but they are coming off an overtime loss to Cleveland despite a 42-point effort from Joel Embiid. The Jazz continue to hold the best record not just in the Western Conference, but in the entire NBA at 27-7. The Jazz own the two longest win streaks in the league this season (11 games and nine games) and have gone 3-2 since their nine-game streak was snapped on Feb. 19 against the Clippers. It was during that nine-game win streak that the Jazz took down the Sixers 134-123 on Feb. 15 as Jordan Clarkson scored 40 off the Jazz bench to counter Ben Simmons\u2019 career-high 42 points as Embiid missed the game due to back soreness. Having Embiid healthy this time around makes the matchup all the more intriguing as we get to see the league\u2019s second-leading scorer in Embiid (30.0 ppg) and top post-up scorer (8.9 per game) going up against the man at the top of the NBA.com Defensive Player Ladder in Gobert. 10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass In the last game to tip off before All-Star, we get a trio of Western Conference All-Star guards in action with Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry and the Phoenix duo of Chris Paul and Devin Booker \u2014 the latter of which is coming off a season-high 43 points on Sunday night. The Suns took the first game of the season over the Warriors, 114-93 on Jan. 28 , in a pivotal game in their season. Prior to that game, the Suns were 8-8 and had lost three straight games. That win over the Warriors has sparked the Suns to go 14-3 over their last 17 games as they have climbed to fourth place in the Western Conference. In that first meeting on Jan. 28, the Suns had seven players score in double figures, led by Mikal Bridges with 20, despite Booker missing the game. That balanced attack was enough to offset Curry\u2019s 27 points and five 3-pointers. Bridges was the primary defender on Curry for 7:05 (67% of Curry\u2019s offensive matchup time), with Curry scoring 12 points on 5-8 shooting to go with two assists and three turnovers. Curry was exceptional when forcing mismatches with Deandre Ayton. In just 40 seconds of matchup time, Curry scored 13 points on 4-5 shooting from the field and 3-4 from 3-point range. \u2022 Watch live games with NBA League Pass "},{"id":499694,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/super-trey-day-fantasy-guide-2021","date":"2021-03-01","title":"Super Trey Day: Fantasy Guide","content":"FanDuel and Mountain Dew have teamed up to bring you Mountain Dew Super Trey Day fantasy contests, celebrating one of the most exciting plays in basketball: the 3-point shot!

Before the action tips off on March 3 , check out some players to consider for your lineups.  Point guards Stephen Curry ($9,900): On a night that 3-point shooting counts more in fantasy, one of the best long-distance shooters in NBA history should be a lock. Curry has shot an absurd 46% from deep against Portland over his career, and the load he has to carry on offense has never been heavier. And have we mentioned that the Blazers sport the third-worst defensive rating in the league? Trae Young ($9,500): If you need to free up an extra $400 elsewhere in your lineup, pivoting from Curry to Young is an option. Orlando\u2019s own point guard situation is a mess, leaving their defense against opposing playmakers in shambles. The Magic are a bottom-10 team in defense and 3s given up. LaMelo Ball ($7,600): The newest Ball brother is quickly shedding the wildcard label, but under $8,000 is a steal for a stat-sheet stuffer against the struggling Timberwolves. In its last three games, Minnesota has given up 15 assists to Chris Paul, a triple-double to Russell Westbrook, and a 20-8-6 line to Coby White. Ball has also hit a 3-pointer in 15 consecutive games. Shooting guards James Harden ($10,800): There\u2019s no need to overthink this. One of the best offensive players of all-time is playing his former team for the first time since the Rockets traded him. Then there\u2019s the added bonus of Kevin Durant being out due to injury, placing even more of a load on Harden\u2019s shoulders. Lock him in. Zach LaVine ($9,800): The Bulls\u2019 newly minted All-Star was tailor-made for 3-point-friendly fantasy contests. LaVine is shooting an absurd 43.3% on a robust 8.1 downtown attempts per game. It just so happens Chicago\u2019s opponent, New Orleans, gives up the most 3-point makes per game in the league. Bruce Brown ($5,300): With Durant out, Brooklyn has compensated for its frontcourt shortcomings with\u2026 Brown? It\u2019s true. The 6-foot-4 guard\u2019s playing time has skyrocketed for the shorthanded Nets, and he\u2019s delivering with 18.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.4 steals over his last five games. Brown is in that fantasy sweet spot where he should get big minutes no matter what happens against Houston.   Small Forwards LeBron James ($10,500): Sacramento bleeds more paint points than any team in the league, and the Lakers happen to have one of the best interior scorers in league history. With Davis still out, it will be up to James to keep the Lakers afloat on the second night of a back-to-back. Don\u2019t let that scare you off of James, who hasn\u2019t shied from heavy minutes this season. With the Clippers and Suns right at their heels in the standings, every game will count. Malik Monk ($4,900): Small forward is deep in bargains on Wednesday, but Monk may no longer qualify if he keeps this up. The resurgent former lottery pick is connecting on a ridiculous 44% of his 3-pointers, and he has scored 19 or more points in six of his last seven games. Monk could be another beneficiary of a juicy matchup with the Timberwolves. Justin Holiday ($4,400): Did you know Holiday has hit a 3-pointer in all but two of his games this season? It\u2019s true. His generous playing time (32.9 mpg) makes him one of the safer role players to roll out there as well. Toss in his defense (1.2 spg) against one of the most turnover-prone teams in the league (Cleveland), and Holiday is primed to provide extra bang for his cost-friendly buck.  Power forwards Zion Williamson ($8,800): He doesn\u2019t make 3-pointers, but Williamson also doesn\u2019t cost a king\u2019s ransom despite his recent tear. The most unstoppable interior force in the league faces a Chicago Bulls team giving up the fourth-most points in the paint this season. On a night boasting few ideal matchups at power forward, Zion might be your safest bet. John Collins ($7,000): Atlanta has changed coaches and is trying to salvage the rest of its 2020-21 season. The Hawks take on the Magic to close out what has been a disappointing first half of the season. Collins, however, has been one of the bright spots for the Hawks of late, averaging 19.9 ppg and 7.5 rpg on 54.4% shooting in February. He has a chance to keep that rolling against Orlando\u2019s frontcourt, who collectively rank among the NBA\u2019s worst in defensive rating at their position. Royce O\u2019Neale ($4,400): It might surprise you to know that Utah\u2019s do-all-the-dirty-work forward is second on the team in minutes (32.5 mpg). He doesn\u2019t score a lot, but he\u2019s an above-average rebounder (6.8) and passer (2.6 apg), hits nearly two 3-pointers per game, and he defends his heart out. He\u2019s also essential against physical opponents like the 76ers. In their last meeting on Feb. 15, O\u2019Neale played nearly 36 minutes and stuffed the stat sheet (11 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals).  Centers Nikola Vucevic ($9,600): Orlando\u2019s All-Star big man will get even more touches against the race-and-pace Hawks, who are a bottom-eight team in overall defense and points given up in the paint. The Magic don\u2019t have a lot of options on offense, leaving Vucevic (who has added 3-point range to his arsenal) to carry the bulk of the considerable scoring they\u2019ll need to keep up with Atlanta. Al Horford ($6,300): How much does one bad game (a blowout against Denver) temper your expectations? In the 13 games prior, Horford had turned back the clock for averages of 17.0 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.8 blocks while hitting a whopping 2.4 long-distance bombs per contest. Dallas\u2019 sixth-worst defense offers further opportunity for a guy that might not be heavily played by your competition. Enes Kanter ($6,300): The Turkish rebounding machine has made a late-career habit of stepping up for injured squads. Without Jusuf Nurkic available, Kanter is once again feasting on the offensive glass. That\u2019s bad news for the Warriors, who yield the fifth-most second-chance points in the league.

He left the Boston Celtics for the Charlotte Hornets, which is the collegiate equivalent of swapping Duke for, ahem, Butler. We\u2019ll get to that tasty analogy a bit later. Hayward\u2019s decision to force a sign-and-trade caused tremors in the basketball world if only because the Celtics fit the description of a title contender (even if they\u2019ve fallen short in that regard) while the Hornets are, once again, on the rebuilding treadmill. It was indeed strange on the surface, although once you consider the contractual jackpot for doing so \u2014 $120 million over four years \u2014 it seems a lot more palatable and a good financial move for Hayward when he declined his option year in Boston. \u2022 Monday on NBA TV: Hornets vs. Blazers (10:30 ET) Hayward has thrived in his new locale, and the Hornets have with him. The big swingman is enjoying one of his better seasons, all things considered, averaging 21.5 points per game on 48.5% shooting overall and 42.1% on 3-pointers as he prepares to turn 31 on March 23. Charlotte has featured him prominently in the offense, a role last familiar to Hayward back in his final days with the Utah Jazz five seasons ago. The Hornets are making an unexpected bid for a playoff spot while the Celtics are scuffling in the lower half of the Eastern Conference standings, far below where they were initially projected even without Hayward. (Boston is 17-17 and the No. 6 seed while Charlotte is 16-17 and No. 8.) Evidently, Hayward has been a difference-maker to a degree with both franchises. What\u2019s more refreshing to Hayward is he\u2019s healthy \u2014 knock-knock on wood \u2014 and therefore avoiding the issues that have plagued him in an otherwise solid 10-year career. His ankle sprain in the first round of the playoffs last season hampered him through the Eastern Conference finals, where the favored Celtics fell to the Miami Heat in six games. Fans have vented frustration at Hayward, which is unfair; players never choose to get hurt, and if anything, injuries are often caused from effort. Blame the basketball gods or Hayward\u2019s crummy luck for that. In an interview last week with 98.5 The Sports Hub in Boston last week, Celtics majority team owner Wyc Grousbeck said : \u201cGordon\u2019s having an excellent year down in Charlotte. Gordon\u2019s flourishing in Charlotte is because he\u2019s featured and because he deserves it. And he\u2019s a great player, as we know. You should have seen the offer we made him to stay, it reflects a lot of respect for his game. But he\u2019s more featured down there and he\u2019s living up to it. And we\u2019re happy for him.\u201d Hayward recently agreed to an interview with NBA.com, where he discussed that departure from Boston, and his thoughts on splashy Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball and how he coped with the blowback from his signing. Also, he weighed in about perhaps his most notable basketball achievement \u2014 nearly leading Butler to a mighty upset of Duke in the 2010 NCAA title game and if he could have a last-shot do-over.  Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited. NBA.com: From the looks of things, you seem more aggressive, you\u2019re embracing the role of being the primary option and you look happy with the Hornets. Is this correct? Hayward: For sure. I\u2019m really enjoying my time in Charlotte, certainly the role\u2019s a little bit different, one that I\u2019m embracing. It\u2019s a season I\u2019m really enjoying. This is the first time you\u2019ve joined a team that wasn\u2019t an established winner; the Jazz won 53 games the season before you arrived and the Celtics were in playoff contention when you signed in 2017. Did you have to adjust your approach coming to a team that has made the playoffs only three times in 16 seasons and never reached the second round? Going in I knew it was going to be a challenge, something I was looking forward to doing, to try and maximize my potential as a basketball player and help us get to that next level. When I first got to Utah we were in the playoffs the year before. But ultimately we started a rebuild in Utah, so I\u2019ve kind of been through that a little bit. We\u2019re trying to build something here in Charlotte like I had there, build the team up. There was a year in Utah when we were in the 20s in wins, then 30s, then 40s, and my last year we scratched for 50. I\u2019m certainly going to build on that experience here in Charlotte. So far we\u2019ve had our ups and downs as a young team. With all the craziness we\u2019ve been through this season as a league, it makes things a little bit harder for a team to grow. But I think we\u2019re doing OK. You\u2019re off to a strong start, what else is working for you? I\u2019ve been trying to get to the free throw line a little bit better. I have to do that more consistently. Driving and getting downhill kind of opens everything up for me, opens up the shot, allows me to get to the free throw line. That\u2019s been a focus. So let\u2019s discuss the elephant in the room. When did you decide to leave the Celtics and why? Not until that day when I decided. There was so much that happened before that, in the bubble, me getting hurt. In the bubble I felt like our team was playing really well, I felt like I was doing well. Then I get hurt, I have to come out of the bubble to rehab, then go back in, not fully healthy, we lose in the playoffs and at the same time I have a baby boy and come back home. The league told us the season probably wasn\u2019t going to start until the end of January, so I have a minor surgery to do and rehab. But then actually we\u2019re going to start right before Christmas. Then you\u2019re scrambling, trying to get ready and healthy, then free agency hits and ultimately you have to decide where to be. It really wasn\u2019t was until the day I decided that I wanted to have a fresh start and try to help this team. Your time in Boston was interrupted by various injuries, especially the big one. After suffering a broken leg just six minutes into your first season there, in hindsight, when were you fully recovered mentally and physically from that? So I get hurt, I come back that next year but I really don\u2019t play 5-on-5 until that training camp. I had to work my way through that season, and then finally I had a whole offseason to train the way I wanted to train. We stayed in Boston and definitely felt good going into that next year. You, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, three All-Stars, played virtually the same role and swing position. You would not have the same freedom and touches in Boston that you have now in Charlotte. Was there any conflict among the three of you, as a result? Did that situation work in your opinion, and if so, would it continue to work had you stayed? I think we would figure out a way to make it work. We won a lot of basketball games together. All of us would tell you that we were disappointed in the way things worked out. Those are two extremely talented players. I think they\u2019re going to be some of the best wing players the league has to offer in the future. It\u2019s one of those things where we had so many good players, not just us three. Kyrie (Irving), Marcus Morris, Marcus Smart, T-Roze (Terry Rozier) now with me in Charlotte. We just had so many different options. Sometimes there\u2019s only one basketball, you know? I think we found a way to make it work. We were right there, certainly with some injuries. I have nothing but positive things to say about my time in Boston. I have great relationships I built there. It was one of those things where I decided what was best for my family and myself, and that was to be here in Charlotte. There was a heavy response both inside and outside the NBA to you switching teams and also the size of the deal with Charlotte. What\u2019s your reaction to the reaction? When I got injured, I decided I can\u2019t be on social media anymore because there was some times when I was injured where I was kind of in a dark place, reading all the comments and not being able to play. I actually didn\u2019t see much of the reaction. I know my friends said some things here and there. For me it was like, who cares what people say? It is what it is. I\u2019m here in Charlotte and I\u2019m gonna try to be the best player I can be here. So, what\u2019s it like to be wanted by Michael Jordan? (Laughs) It\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s definitely like, you\u2019re sitting there, and then you get a phone call from Michael Jordan and he says, hey young fella, I want you to come play for us. That\u2019s pretty cool. And it\u2019s the second go-round for me with him. I always remember him and the organization believing in me earlier when they gave me the offer sheet when I was in Utah that ultimately the Jazz matched. It\u2019s just a great feeling having him believe in you. From your conversations with him, how badly does Jordan want to get this turned around and put this franchise on the map? It\u2019s Michael Jordan, you know? I definitely think he wants to win, he wants to win in everything. So this is something that I\u2019m trying to help with. We have a lot of young talented players and you can see it on the court when we play well. Sometimes we also lay an egg and I\u2019m trying to help us be more consistent. His appetite for winning extends to golf. You\u2019re not getting into a foursome with him anytime soon, are you? No, no, I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t play golf. No way. (Laughs) I can\u2019t get roped into that. The Hornets are suddenly must-see TV because the team is entertaining. After so many dreary years, Charlotte finally has a fun team, yet can\u2019t fill the arena because of the pandemic. That has to be bittersweet, right? I love the way we play the game. We pass the ball, we move, we cut. Obviously with LaMelo, he\u2019s a fun guy to play with, he makes some exciting plays. Miles (Bridges), the alley oops and the connection they have, T-Roze and the dunks he\u2019s had. There have been many games where it would\u2019ve been an electric atmosphere in the building. We\u2019ve had some great wins at home. It\u2019s disappointing there\u2019s no fans. Us players live for that. Definitely not the same, but it\u2019s the world we\u2019re in right now. For example, I just got tested for the third time today. They said there\u2019s a chance in the second half we can get some fans. When did you know LaMelo Ball could be special as a rookie? You could see it in training camp. He has a special feel for the game, a magnet for the ball, he\u2019s in the right place in right time, and a lot taller than I thought. He gets to his spot, got a great handle. He\u2019s going to be really, really good. How much of a better player is Terry Rozier now, compared to when he was with you as a backup in Boston? Terry is thriving with more responsibility. He plays with a great mindset, he\u2019s embracing the bigger role. He\u2019s a guy that can fill it up; he\u2019s had multiple 40-point games already this year. We need his shooting, his shot-making, and also need him defensively because he puts unreal pressure on the ball. You\u2019ve been coached by Jerry Sloan, Quin Snyder and Brad Stevens, all of whom have high credentials, and now James Borrego, who comes from the Gregg Popovich tree. What have you taken from them? I try to learn as much as I can from all these guys. I had coach Sloan in my rookie year, obviously with Brad in college and being able to play with him for the Celtics, coach Quin is a terrific coach and you can see how they\u2019re doing this year in Utah. And with JB here in Charlotte, from day one we\u2019ve had a good relationship and he\u2019s well on his way. Here\u2019s a deal from the Basketball Gods. They say your half-court shot against Duke at the buzzer in the NCAA championship game is good, and you and Butler become college basketball immortals. But in exchange, the Gods want one year of your NBA career. You making that deal? I don\u2019t know if I would make any deal with the Gods. I think what happens, happens. Those runs with my Butler guys were something I\u2019ll never forget. It\u2019s interesting: I\u2019ve kind of come full circle here. I played under Brad in college and the NBA. I definitely didn\u2019t think that would ever happen, meaning me in the NBA, not necessarily him in the NBA. Then this year I have the opportunity to play under coach Ronald Nored, who\u2019s an assistant here. Ron was our starting point guard and my road roommate in college. It\u2019s been really fun having him here. We\u2019ve always had a good relationship. He was instrumental in my deciding to come here because I was able to talk to him first as a friend, and then as an assistant coach, and picked his brain about what it\u2019s like to play here and live here. So, as far as the basketball Gods, I don\u2019t know if I would make a deal. I wish the shot had gone in, but I\u2019m happy with how things have turned out. You were a two-time Indiana state singles champion in tennis. If you stuck with the sport instead of switching to basketball, which kinda worked out in hindsight, would you be on the ATP tour right now? Man, that\u2019s a good question. I was a better tennis player in high school than I was a basketball player, but I always loved basketball more. Thankfully I was able to grow throughout high school to get to the frame I have now. Man, I still watch tennis and those guys are impressive. I don\u2019t know if I could make it on tour. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Sacramento Kings\u2019 shooting guard sank his 1,000th 3-pointer in Sunday\u2019s game against Charlotte. Doing so in just his 350th career game marked the shortest time in NBA history a player needed to reach 1,000 makes from distance, besting the previous record held by Stephen Curry (369). However, the moment was likely somewhat dampened after the Kings blew an eight-point lead in the final 53 seconds in a 127-126 loss. Malik Monk finished an and-1 layup and made the game-winning free throw with 1.4 seconds remaining in regulation to lift the Hornets over the Kings. P.J. Washington recorded a career-high 42 points for the Hornets, while LaMelo Ball tallied 24 points and a career-high 12 assists in the victory. Hield (30 points, eight 3-pointers) and Harrison Barnes (28 points, six rebounds) combined for 58 points for the Kings in the losing effort. The Hornets improve to 16-17 on the season, while the Kings fall to 13-21. The first half was highlighted by a scoring duel between Hield and Charlotte\u2019s PJ Washington. Hield made five 3s and had 17 points in the first quarter to help the Kings go up by 14. Washington brought the Hornets back, scoring 14 of his 22 first-half points in the second period to cut the lead to 67-66.

Second-year guard Tyler Herro, meanwhile, slide back into the lineup after missing the past three games with a hip injury. The Heat beat the Hawks 109-99 to get their sixth straight win and climb back to .500 and Herro had 12 of his 14 points for Miami in the fourth quarter. The six straight wins is Miami\u2019s longest such regular-season streak since a seven-game run midway through the 2017-18 season. The Heat had a seven-game win streak in last season\u2019s playoffs as well. Over his last 15 games, Butler averaged 21.9 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 8.7 assists while lifting the Heat from a slow start to the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race. \u201cWe want to be proactive about it,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Butler\u2019s injury. \u201cHe will be day-to-day from here.\u201d Herro is averaging 16.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 3.8 assists despite a fluctuating role due to a slew of Miami injuries and early-season bout with COVID-19.

In fact, he\u2019s currently in the best stretch of his career right now, averaging 25.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, 8.6 assists, and 1.2 steals over his last 19 games played. That has led to him scoring at least 37 FanDuel points in 15 of those 19 fixtures, which is an absurd total from someone in this price range. We also don\u2019t mind that he faces a Charlotte team that ranks 20th in defensive efficiency, either. Ja Morant (PG \u2013 MEM) at HOU $7,100 Ja has remained in this $7K-range all season long, and if it weren\u2019t for a slow adjustment in his return from injury, he\u2019d be closer to $8,000. If you take out the game where he got injured, Morant is averaging over 36 fantasy points per game, scoring at least 28 FD points in all but three fixtures. We love that against a Houston team that ranks third in pace, which caters to Morant\u2019s athleticism beautifully. Kemba Walker (PG \u2013 BOS) vs. WAS $6,800 Kemba has been slow in his return from injury, but recent results would indicate that he\u2019s starting to return to the All-Star player we know and love. Over his last six games, Walker is averaging 36 fantasy points per game in 33 minutes a night. Those minutes are a huge sign, especially with Kemba taking 18 shots a game in that span while flirting with a 30 percent usage rate. The best part might be this matchup, though, with Washington ranked 27th in defensive efficiency while playing at the fastest pace in the league. P.J. Washington (PF \u2013 CHA) at SAC $6,000 With Cody Zeller nicked up, Washington should find himself in another lofty role. That was certainly the case on Friday, with P.J. collecting 43 fantasy points in one of the best games of his career. An injury did hurt some of his production last week and lowered his price, but this is a guy who\u2019s scored over 30 FD points in 13 of the 28 games he\u2019s played. That seems like a strong possibility when you consider this matchup, with Sacramento ranked dead-last in defensive efficiency. Dennis Schroder (PG \u2013 LAL) vs. GSW $5,800 Schroder made his return from the COVID list on Friday, providing 30 FanDuel points across 32 minutes of play. That\u2019s his lowest total in the last four games without Anthony Davis, averaging nearly 40 fantasy points per game in those outings. That makes him a huge value, particularly against a 19th-ranked Warriors defense that plays at the NBA\u2019s second-fastest pace. Goran Dragic (PG \u2013 MIA) vs. ATL $5,500 Dragic just returned from a lengthy absence on Friday, and his 38 FanDuel points showed just how much he means to this team. He also played 33 minutes, and one has to believe he could return to the starting lineup here. That makes him a heck of a value, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before he\u2019s $1,000 more in the coming weeks. Robert Williams (C \u2013 BOS) vs. WAS $5,300 Williams is one of the riskier options out there, but he has a ton of upside. We say that because he\u2019s averaging about 1.4 FD points per minute and has seen his playing time rise recently. He\u2019s now played at least 16 minutes in five of his last seven games, scoring at least 35 fantasy points in four of those, despite averaging fewer than 20 minutes a night. That\u2019s a monster number from someone this cheap, and it\u2019s scary to think how good he could be if he played closer to 25-30 minutes. We clearly love the matchup too. Ricky Rubio (PG \u2013 MIN) vs. PHO $5,100: With D\u2019Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley out of the lineup, Rubio should be in for even more ball-handling duties. That\u2019s already been the case recently, with Ricky averaging 28 FD points per game across his last 10 outings. That\u2019s all you can ask for from someone in this price range, and his role should increase with so many key pieces out of this lineup."},{"id":503360,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-virus-issues-worsen-game-vs-bulls-called-off","date":"2021-02-28","title":"Raptors' virus issues worsen, game vs. Bulls called off","content":"The Toronto Raptors\u2019 issues with the coronavirus have worsened, prompting the NBA to call off their game scheduled for Sunday night against the Chicago Bulls. The league said the Raptors are dealing with positive test results, without disclosing how many, and that combined with ongoing contact tracing issues meant they would not have the league-required eight players available to play. Toronto played Friday without head coach Nick Nurse , several other assistants and staffers and starting forward Pascal Siakam because of virus-related issues. Assistant coach Sergio Scariolo coached the team to a win over Houston and was in line to coach again Sunday. All NBA players and coaches are tested daily. The Raptors used 12 players on Friday and had 14 listed as available to play that night. For Sunday\u2019s game, Siakam was the only player who had been listed on Saturday\u2019s injury report as out because of health and safety protocols \u2014 which indicates that results that came back on Saturday either showed more problems, or the contact tracing investigations showed that players had been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and may have to quarantine. The Raptors-Bulls game is the 30th to be postponed so far this season because of COVID-19 testing or contact tracing. Chicago had traveled to Tampa on Saturday for the game and after the postponement was announced changed its travel plans to fly back home Sunday afternoon.

The Spurs currently have four players stuck in the league\u2019s health and safety protocols and just listed LaMarcus Aldridge as questionable to play with a wrist issue. He should see plenty of Trey Lyles and Jakob Poeltl in the paint, and this could easily be a game where Adams grabs 15+ rebounds. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS) $5,900 His value is contingent on whether or not LaMarcus Aldridge will be able to play after being listed as questionable with a wrist injury. We all know what Poeltl is capable of when given the minutes, as he\u2019s gone on to average nearly 9.0 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks per game without Aldridge in the lineup this season. If Aldridge does indeed sit, Poeltl is a lock for 6X value with his $5,900 price tag. Rui Hachimura (SF \u2013 WAS) $5,800 Hachimura has been receiving heavy minutes for Washington and has produced quite nicely during their impressive hot streak. He\u2019s seen no less than 36 minutes in five of his last six games and is averaging 28.2 FanDuel points per game during that span. As mentioned earlier, Saturday\u2019s matchup with the Timberwolves has the second-highest over-under on the slate, and both teams rank in the bottom seven when it comes to defensive efficiency. There\u2019s a good chance Hachimura finds himself playing 35+ minutes in a shootout, and that makes him hard to pass up with his $5,800 price tag. Darius Bazley (PF \u2013 OKC) $5,400 Bazley has been seeing a solid amount of playing time due to all of the injuries in Oklahoma City and is coming off of an 18-point, 12-rebound outing against the Hawks on Friday. The Nuggets provide another great matchup for Bazley, as they are surrendering the fifth-most FanDuel points to opposing power forwards this season. To make things even better, Paul Millsap will remain out, and Michael Porter Jr. will likely start at power forward on Saturday. To put it nicely, Porter Jr. isn\u2019t known much for his defensive abilities. Jalen Brunson (PG \u2013 DAL) $4,900 Brunson has been seeing a larger workload over his last six games, playing 27.5 minutes and averaging 16.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.3 rebounds. While Brooklyn has improved defensively throughout their eight-game winning streak, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better matchup for Brunson. This game currently has the highest over-under on the slate, and the Mavericks will likely need his offense to help keep pace with the blazing Nets. Joe Harris (SF \u2013 BKN) $4,800 Harris has been the best 3-point shooter in the NBA this season and gets a matchup against the Mavericks, who are giving up the second-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards this season. Given that this game has the highest over-under on the slate, Harris will have plenty of opportunities to return plenty of value relative to his affordable $4,800 price tag. Lonnie Walker IV (SG \u2013 SAS) $4,200 As previously mentioned, the Spurs still have a handful of guys in the league\u2019s health and safety protocols, while DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge are listed as questionable. All of these absences will open up the door for Walker to start and see a hefty workload. The Pelicans have the second-lowest defensive efficiency rating in the league this season, so Walker should have plenty of opportunities to produce. Trey Lyles (PF \u2013 SAS) $4,000 Much like Lonnie Walker IV, Lyles\u2019 value lies in the plethora of injuries currently plaguing the Spurs. With Keldon Johnson ruled out and LaMarcus Aldridge listed questionable, Lyles should see between 25-30 mins and should have no problem exceeding his value against a pathetic Pelicans defense. Jaylen Nowell (PG \u2013 MIN) $3,700 This is solely a high-risk, high-reward type of play, as it\u2019s certain Nowell won\u2019t see more than 5% ownership due to his widely unknown status. The hope is that he sees a larger role with Malik Beasley suspended and D\u2019Angelo Russell rehabbing his injured knee. So far this season, Nowell has seen a 24.5% usage rate in 196 minutes without Russell and Beasley off of the floor and is averaging 12.5 points over his last two games. This game has the second-highest over-under on the slate, so Nowell should have plenty of opportunities to produce value. Ty Jerome (SG \u2013 OKC) $3,500 Jerome was called up from the G League and immediately impressed during his season debut Friday. He put up nine points, five rebounds, seven assists, and two steals in 22 minutes and should see similar playing time against the Nuggets. Much like Nowell, this is a high-risk, high-reward play that should easily breeze past his minimum price on FanDuel."},{"id":502488,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/g-leagues-jeremy-lin-recounts-racist-insult-on-court","date":"2021-02-27","title":"G League's Jeremy Lin recounts racist insult on court","content":"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Warriors G League guard Jeremy Lin shared on social media that he experienced an act of racism on the court.

Kerr said it was brought to his attention Friday night that Lin had expressed his dismay publicly. Lin \u2014 the first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent in the NBA \u2014 and his team are playing at the neutral G League bubble venue in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. \u201cBeing an Asian American doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t experience poverty and racism. Being a 9-year NBA veteran doesn\u2019t protect me from being called \u2018coronavirus\u2019 on the court,\u201d Lin wrote. \u201cBeing a man of faith doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t fight for justice, for myself and for others. So here we are again, sharing how we feel. Is anyone listening?\u201d Kerr wasn\u2019t sure how he would proceed until he gathered more information, but vowed to support Lin. The 32-year-old Lin played 29 games for the Warriors as a rookie in 2010-11, then went to the New York Knicks and gained the popularity that spawned the nickname \u201cLinsanity.\u201d A Taiwanese American, Lin was born in the Southern California city of Torrance but grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cReally powerful. I applaud Jeremy for his words and echo his sentiments regarding racism against the Asian-American community,\u201d Kerr said before Golden State hosted Charlotte at Chase Center. \u201cIt\u2019s just so ridiculous and obviously spawned by many people, including our former president, as it relates to the coronavirus originating in China. It\u2019s just shocking. I can\u2019t wrap my head around any of it, but I can\u2019t wrap my head around racism in general. \u201cWe\u2019re all just flesh and blood. We\u2019re all just people. As (Gregg) Pop (Popovich) once said to me, `We\u2019re all accidents of birth. We\u2019re born. We come out the way we are. We don\u2019t have a say in it. What we do have a say in is how we treat people.\u2032 It\u2019s shocking to me that we can treat each other so poorly based on the color of skin or whatever it is. So I applaud Jeremy for speaking up.\u201d Lin also wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cSomething is changing in this generation of Asian Americans. We are tired of being told that we don\u2019t experience racism, we are tired of being told to keep our heads down and not make trouble. We are tired of Asian American kids growing up and being asked where they\u2019re REALLY from, of having our eyes mocked, of being objectified as exotic or being told we\u2019re inherently unattractive. We are tired of the stereotypes in Hollywood affecting our psyche and limiting who we think we can be. We are tired of being invisible, of being mistaken for our colleague or told our struggles aren\u2019t as real. \u201cI want better for my elders who worked so hard and sacrificed so much to make a life for themselves here. I want better for my niece and nephew and future kids. I want better for the next generation of Asian American athletes than to have to work so hard to just be \u2018deceptively athletic.\u2019\u201d"},{"id":502418,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brooklyn-nets-sign-andre-roberson-and-iman-shumpert-to-10-day-contracts","date":"2021-02-27","title":"Brooklyn Nets sign Andre Roberson and Iman Shumpert to 10-day contracts","content":"BROOKLYN \u2014 The Brooklyn Nets have signed guard\/forward Andre Roberson and guard Iman Shumpert to 10-day contracts.

He has two reasons why the league should: the fans and the game\u2019s economy. Silver, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the fact that about 100 million votes were cast by fans for All-Star starters shows that the people who follow the game globally wanted the league\u2019s midseason showcase to be played. And the league, he said, didn\u2019t want to disappoint them. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest factor, the amount of engagement we get from our fans around All-Star,\u201d Silver said. \u201cHistorically, in the modern digital age, we have roughly 100 million people vote for our All-Stars, and we came out about the same this year even with a shortened voting period.\u201d Players have raised some questions about why the game is necessary and the risks involved in playing it during a pandemic. The league has said it will fly players into Atlanta privately, keep them in a hotel for one night, play the game on March 7 and fly them back out again immediately afterward. They believe that plan, combined with ongoing daily testing and with no outside All-Star events, will minimize risks. \u201cWe know we can\u2019t eliminate risk completely,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe never can in a pandemic.\u201d The NBA has touted the game\u2019s global reach for years and All-Star is no exception, with the game to be shown in more than 200 countries and broadcast in about 40 languages. The league expects 1 billion video views on social media from the events on March 7 as well. \u201cFor a league that doesn\u2019t have a neutral-site championship series historically, the focus typically is having an opportunity during our season to bring the entire community together,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t have the opportunity to do that in person this year. But the NBA community is 99% virtual. It\u2019s a global community on social media, representing close to 1.9 billion people who are engaged with us. There fact that there won\u2019t be the traditional receptions and parties and fan events \u2014 and we\u2019ll sadly miss them \u2014 it won\u2019t change the experience for the largest portion of our fans.\u201d There is a financial element as well, and Silver has not hidden from that. He said last week that Turner Sports, a league broadcast partner, wanted the game to happen in Atlanta, where the network is headquartered \u2014 and that indeed is where the game is taking place. The league held last season\u2019s final regular-season games and the entirety of the playoffs at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; Disney owns ESPN, another league broadcast partner. \u201cMy personal view is very few people do anything just for the money,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut at the same time, while we\u2019re clearly in a health emergency in this country, we\u2019re also in the midst of an economic crisis and that extends to the NBA as well. There are tens of thousands of people who are dependent on the NBA for their livelihoods. So, for those who say we\u2019re doing it for the money, they could say the same thing about our entire operation, about the fact that we\u2019re even playing our season.\u201d The league missed revenue projections last season by about $1.5 billion, and revenues will be down again this season largely because of fewer games and far fewer fans in buildings. Most arenas are empty for games; those that aren\u2019t empty are playing to capacities 80% to 90% below normal. \u201cWe always begin with the health and safety of our players and everyone involved,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt was no different than our view going into the bubble. If we could keep our community healthy and safe, then it was appropriate to proceed. And we looked at the All-Star Game the same way. We know how to operate a bubble. We\u2019re going to operate a mini-bubble in Atlanta that will be constructed no differently than the operation we ran either for the NBA in Orlando or for the WNBA in Bradenton, Florida, or for the G League for that matter is operating in right now in Orlando.\u201d Silver addressed some other issues with AP, including: Pandemic season  The league has gotten about 95% of its scheduled games played in the season\u2019s first half, with 29 called off for reasons related to the coronavirus pandemic. A handful of other games were called off after the ice storm that crippled Texas earlier this month. Silver said the league went into this season knowing some games would be postponed, and said he\u2019s pleased that almost all games have happened as scheduled. He also touted the success of the league\u2019s protocols regarding health and safety and how they\u2019ve evolved as the season goes along. Expansion Silver said he continues to believe expansion of the league is \u201cinevitable,\u201d but said there is no timetable, either officially or in his head about when that will happen. \u201cIt was not under active consideration before the pandemic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cCertainly, during the pandemic as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve dusted off some of the plans that we previously looked at for potential expansion. But it remains on the backburner and it would not be appropriate to expand right now, given where our focus is on trying to work through this season.

Set to return from a three-game absence because of lower back stiffness, Porzingis brushed off the trade talk \u2014 but not in the same direct way owner Mark Cuban and coach Rick Carlisle have tried to refute reports that the Mavericks were open to proposals. \u201cIt kind of like came out, and it is what it is,\u201d Porzingis said Friday, a day before a meeting with Brooklyn that could be his second game in New York since the trade. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, and I shouldn\u2019t be too worried about it. It can only distract me at the end of the day.\u201d Coach Rick Carlisle said he expected the 2018 All-Star to play against Kyrie Irving, James Harden and the Nets if there weren\u2019t any issues Saturday morning. The 25-year-old Porzingis missed the first nine games of the season recovering from right knee surgery after getting injured in his first career playoff game in the Florida bubble last summer. Porzingis\u2019 right knee caused a 10-game absence earlier in his first Dallas season. He was traded while recovering from a torn ligament in his left knee, an injury sustained in what ended up being his final game with the Knicks in February 2018. The Mavericks chose not to play him for the remainder of the 2018-19 season, and he has rested on the second night of back-to-backs eight times with Dallas. The back issue isn\u2019t new, but has never kept him out this long with the Mavericks. \u201cI just haven\u2019t had the best luck,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cI\u2019m working toward making sure my body is strong and durable and I can just play without thinking about anything, without worrying, just being free and enjoying the game I love.\u201d All told, Porzingis has missed 32 of 106 games over two regular seasons with the Mavericks, who acquired him with the hope of making him the sidekick to star point guard Luka Doncic. Porzingis also missed half of the six games during a first-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in August. \u201cThe challenge comes with starting the season midstream and not having December workouts, the preseason workouts or the traditional training camp to build a base,\u201d Carlisle said earlier in the week. \u201cWe\u2019ll work through this.\u201d The back issue cropped up after the Mavericks were idle for a week because of two weather-related postponements. It will be almost two weeks between games for Porzingis if he plays against Brooklyn. Porzingis\u2019 offensive game has been uneven, as illustrated not long before the latest absence when he had 15 points on 6-of-14 shooting in one game before scoring 36 and making eight of 13 3-pointers the next. His defense has suffered, with Porzingis ranking near the bottom of the NBA in defensive efficiency while averaging 1.6 blocks per game. That would be a career low and is significantly off his career average of 2.0. \u201cI\u2019ve had situations \u2026 on defense, you see with your eyes and your mind and you want to react and you\u2019re half a step late and you\u2019re not there,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cThat\u2019s a frustrating feeling, too. When you know you can do it, but you just don\u2019t do it.\u201d"},{"id":502145,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-friday-feb-26-2021","date":"2021-02-26","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Friday, Feb. 26, 2021","content":"Pacers (15-15) at Celtics (15-17)  7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 This is the third meeting of the season between these teams; they split the first two games (Dec. 27 and 29) with both games decided by five points or less.

Specifically, Lin was calling to attention in his Facebook post the need to remind his followers that racism and stereotypes have an impact on Asian Americans. Lin last played in the NBA during the 2018-19 season, which he split between the Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors as a reserve. Prior to that, he played for the New York Knicks, Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets. During a memorable stretch of games in February of 2012 that became known as \u201cLinsanity,\u201d Lin and the Knicks put together a long winning streak that captivated the fanbase and the city. He spent last season with the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association and had previously criticized former U.S. president Donald Trump for his use of the term \u201cChinese virus\u201d in regards to COVID-19. Per The Associated Press , U.S. bigotry toward Asian Americans spread quickly throughout the U.S. in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Initial evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested the virus began in bats, which then infected another animal that may have spread it to people at one of Wuhan, China\u2019s \u201cwet markets.\u201d That information quickly got distorted in the U.S., spurring racist memes on social media and a rise in hate and discrimination toward Asians and Asian Americans was not far behind. In August, Stop AAPI Hate \u2014 a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups \u2014 issued a report stating it received more than 2,500 reports of hate and discrimination across the country since the group was founded last March. The group said it received data from 47 states, with 46% of the incidents taking place in California and 14% in New York. Asian American small businesses have been among the hardest hit by the economic downturn during the pandemic. Small-business activity nationwide fell 22% from February through April, 2020 but Asian American business-owner activity fell 26% during that window, per the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Matched against fellow MVP candidate Luka Doncic, Embiid led the 76ers to their fourth win in five outings on Thursday, as they forced the Mavericks into a season-high 22 turnovers, including 13 in the first half. Still, you can\u2019t overlook Embiid\u2019s field goal percentage (26%) over the last three games, or the fact he\u2019s making his living largely at the free-throw line lately, despite coming into Thursday\u2019s game averaging 29.8 points. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you know he\u2019s big, but you don\u2019t realize how big he is, and his post game is so much more efficient than I remember it,\u201d 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. Meanwhile, LeBron James continues to struggle to keep Los Angeles afloat in the wake of an injury to Anthony Davis and the absence of Dennis Schroder due to the league\u2019s health and safety protocols for contract tracing. James is averaging 37.3 minutes over the 12 games he\u2019s played in the month of February, but the 36-year-old isn\u2019t asking anyone for a reprieve. \u201cI\u2019m going out and playing the game,\u201d James said Monday after playing more than 43 minutes in Los Angeles\u2019 127-124 overtime loss to the Washington Wizards. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job, and I\u2019m trying to do it at a high level. I have never asked for time off or time throughout the season, and it\u2019s growing to a point where it\u2019s not even coming from me anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, \u2018O.K., LeBron should take time off,\u2019 or \u2018Why is his workload at this?\u2019 I\u2019ve been hearing it for five, six, seven years now, and I\u2019m still going strong. So, I don\u2019t need a handout. I\u2019m not looking for a handout. My job is to go out when I\u2019m available, when I\u2019m healthy to go out and play, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d While none of the top three in the race have separated themselves from the pack, Embiid moves to No. 1, while James falls back to No. 2, followed by Nikola Jokic, who jumped from No. 5 in last week\u2019s edition back to No. 3. Portland\u2019s recent three-game losing streak pushes Damian Lillard down a spot to fifth, while Stephen Curry maintains his No. 4 spot. On the heels of his first All-Star nod, Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine makes his debut this week. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: 1. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 29.6 ppg, 11.2 rpg, 3.1 apg, 1.3 bpg, 1.3 spg Embiid and the 76ers dominated the Mavericks in the paint Thursday, outscoring them 50-26. Embiid shot 10 or more free throws for the ninth consecutive game, which ranks as the second longest streak in the NBA over the last 10 seasons behind James Harden\u2019s 21 straight games in 2019. As the 76ers prepare for Saturday\u2019s matchup against Cleveland ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ), Embiid has averaged 22 points over the last three games, and he\u2019s hitting just 26.4% overall while cashing in at the free-throw line (34 of 38). Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats: 25.6 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 8.0 apg, 1.0 spg The Lakers have four straight losses with a slate of tough opponents upcoming in Portland, Golden State and Phoenix. Despite racking up 31 points, James committed a season-high eight turnovers Monday in a loss to Washington before finishing a season-worst minus-20 Wednesday during a 114-89 drubbing at the hands of Utah. Davis\u2019 timetable for return is uncertain, but the expectation is he\u2019ll come back after the break. Schroder could be in the lineup tonight when the Lakers host Portland ( 10 ET, ESPN ), and his return should alleviate some of the burden for James to create offensively. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 5 Season stats: 26.9 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 8.4 apg, 1.7 spg The Nuggets have dropped four of their last six games, but Jokic is averaging 27.3 ppg on 53.9% shooting in 12 February games, hitting 47.1% on 3-pointers and 96.4% from the line. Jamal Murray remains a solid co-star to Jokic, but the Nuggets need more from Michael Porter Jr. if the individual exploits of the stars are going to consistently lead to victories. Jokic, Murray and Porter combined to score 76 points on 52% from the field in Thursday\u2019s loss to Washington , while the rest of the team combined for 34 points on 29% from the floor. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 Season stats: 30.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 6.3 apg, 1.2 spg Curry put together a career-best streak of scoring 25 points or more in 13 consecutive games, before shooting a season-worst 1 of 11 from deep Wednesday to finish with 24 in Golden State\u2019s win against the Indiana Pacers . The returns of James Wiseman (sprained wrist) and Kevon Looney (sprained ankle) should only help Curry, who has been carrying the load for Golden State. The Warriors are excelling against sub-.500 teams (11-6), while struggling against teams better than .500 (7-9). But Curry is doing his part, averaging 33.8 ppg in February and shooting 50.2% overall while surrendering 2.6 turnovers per game. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Season stats: 29.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 8.0 apg, 1.0 spg A two-day break could do Lillard some good going into tonight\u2019s matchup against the Lakers ( 10 ET, ESPN ). Portland is coming off a three-game skid on the heels of a season-high six-game winning streak. The Blazers are 3-9 when Lillard is held to fewer than 30 points, and they\u2019re 14-4 when he puts up 30 or more. Like the Warriors, Portland seems to handle business against the teams it should beat, given its record of 13-6 against teams below .500. When the Trail Blazers clash against foes with records above .500, that record slips to 5-7. 6. Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers 7. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 8. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 9. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 10. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets And five more: Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets; Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz; Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns; Paul George, LA Clippers; Zach LaVine, Chicago Bulls. * * * Michael C.

Soon, they were standing side by side with the exercise designed to shown their commonality and not differences. They were then shown a music video by rapper Lil Baby, whose song \u201cThe Bigger Picture,\u201d was written following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while being detained by Minneapolis police \u2014 a killing that triggered protests across the country and outrage around the world.

Following the video, the students and officers broke into smaller groups for 30 minutes to discuss the video and come up with ideas to help bridge the gap between them. Williams identifies with the kids. He grew up poor in a single-parent home in Cleveland and understands their struggles and frustrations. He knows the first step toward creating trust with the police is by showing how much they are the same. \u201cI know a lot of what happens in our city because I\u2019ve lived it, and I still live here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for kids to actually see, \u2018Oh, yeah, I went hungry before, too.

I\u2019m just going to reach out to him and find out. Until we have more information, it\u2019s hard to tell. It was six years ago. That\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of tough to understand.\u201d In his final interview with reporters when that 2014-15 season ended, Millsap spoke about how much he enjoyed joining the Jazz and seeing the team grow and did not mention any incident with Lindsey. It\u2019s common for media end-of-season sessions to occur on the same day as the team exit interviews, but it is unknown if Millsap\u2019s meeting with reporters was before or after his meeting with Lindsey and Snyder. Millsap gave no indication of any unhappiness with the organization in the interview with reporters that day. He talked about his level of comfort with the team and with the city because of his brother\u2019s long tenure with the Jazz, even saying that he knew the names of the ushers. Millsap also said he had \u201ca pretty good relationship\u201d with Snyder. \u201cWe\u2019ve been nip and tuck on some things, but we\u2019ve always had the same interest and same goal in mind, and that\u2019s winning,\u201d Millsap said at that time of Snyder. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to put me in my position, put me in my place where I can be successful, and I\u2019ve just got to listen and get better.\u201d The Jazz wound up waiving Millsap in January 2016, after 67 games with the team over two seasons. He averaged 4.2 points in those games and did not indicate any unhappiness in a farewell tweet after the team gave him the news. \u201cThank You Jazz organization for the opportunity,\u201d Millsap wrote on Jan. 5, 2016. \u201cReally appreciate my teammates and all the Jazz fans for your love &support.\u201d He closed the tweet with the hashtag \u201cAlltheBest.\u201d "},{"id":506015,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hbcu-student-showcase-asha-gaines-smith","date":"2021-02-26","title":"HBCU Student Showcase: Asha Gaines-Smith","content":"This piece was inspired by the dance lines at HBCUs. When I was thinking about my HBCU experience, I thought about the showtime band, and the dance line that performs with it. The way they perform, the music they perform to, and the way they dress is so unique to the HBCU experience, and I wanted to portray this energy in my piece. Every time I see the showtime dance-line at my HBCU I am in awe of who we are as a people. I believe this form of expression is one of many ways we as Black people are unique and versatile in every way. As someone who isn\u2019t that coordinated, I chose to translate this expression the best way I knew how. Hello my name is Asha Gaines-Smith and I am a junior Theatre Technology Major from Cleveland Ohio. I am currently the Marketing Director for The Howard Players, a witness for The Howard University Mock Trial, Fine Arts Student Liaison, and a member of the Transfer Student Association. I chose to go to Howard because I wanted to be educated in its strong theatre program and have the same experiences as so many great artists that have graduated from Howard. The best thing about going to an HBCU is the ability I have to experience classes made by my people and for my people. I love that I get to have an unapologetically Black experience every time I go to class. After I graduation I plan to either go directly into working in an art department for television and films or continue my education.

The inspiration behind it was \u201cHBCU student by day, HBCU athlete by night.\u201d I use ProCreate on my iPad accompanied with my apple pencil to create my artwork. My creative process was learning to not overthink the piece, as this was the third and final draft of the piece. It took about three days to complete. Once I stopped overthinking, played some good music, stayed true to my artistic style and let my hand just draw, I came up with a dope original piece. Bio: I\u2019m from Kansas City, Missouri. I\u2019m in an organization called Howard Players but I mostly do a lot of freelance photoshoots and graphic design for students on campus. I chose my HBCU because I wanted to go to an art school but I wanted to be around all Black people and I wanted that HBCU college experience. Howard is the perfect mix of an art school and regular university. Seeing the diversity of Black people, different talents, different fashion senses, backgrounds and being around people and professors who truly care. If I don\u2019t have a job or any big creative projects lined up, I plan to go to USC for grad school furthering my education in film studies. The ultimate goal is to direct classic Black films, I also wouldn\u2019t mind acting. My three biggest inspirations in the film industry are John Singleton, Spike Lee and Ryan Coogler.

I enjoy drawing dynamic and visually active pictures and this opportunity with the NBA was the perfect opportunity to do so. I wanted this piece to really be a celebration of HBCU rivalries in sports and to show how much they mean to us as a culture. Aside from the band rivalries, sports are the next biggest thing when it comes to HBCUs. In addition, I also wanted my influences over the years from anime and manga to show through the illustration as well because there is a lack of Black representation in that space and I always use my work and skills as a platform to amplify Black voices, experiences and culture. Bio: Elijah Rutland, a senior Graphic Design scholar at Florida A&M University (FAMU) in Tallahassee, FL., is the founder and creator of the rapidly-emerging Fix My Sole brand( www.fixmysole.com ). The brand specializes in the artistic customization of sneakers as well as the conceptualization and execution of unique digital illustrations. Rutland got his start by sketching shoe designs on paper in elementary school because his parents would not buy him the expensive sneakers he wanted. In fact, Rutland recounts how his father told him he would \u201cbuy shares of NIKE stock rather than NIKE sneakers.\u201d Besides his sneaker art, Rutland has enjoyed renown as a digital illustrator as well. In 2018 he created the Black Rolf meme that went viral around the globe. As a result, Warner Bros., Inc. featured Rutland and Black Rolf at Comic-Con 2019 in San Diego. Rutland has also completed two internships at Warner Bros., working as a production manager on projects such as Netflix\u2019s Green Eggs and Ham and a background painter on HBO Max\u2019s upcoming \u201cAquaman: King of Atlantis\u201d series. Rutland and his work have been featured prominently in GQ.com, solecollector.com and Airbrush Action magazine, among others. Rutland is a native of Macon, GA., and has thoroughly enjoyed his time as a student at Florida A&M University. He chose FAMU because from his first steps and interactions with the students on campus he knew that FAMU was the right place for him. It felt like he was a student there even though it was only new student orientation. Now he\u2019s in his fourth year and that feeling of FAMULY holds truer than ever. The best thing about FAMU is the support and love that Rattlers show to one another. No matter who you are or where you are from, if you went to FAMU you are a part of the FAMULY and they look out for you in any way they can, and that isn\u2019t something you can get anywhere else. Rutland plans to work in the animation industry as a background painter following graduation before eventually becoming an independent visual artist, designer, and director.

The concept is inspired by a conversation I shared with a woman regarding my commitment to Howard University.

This piece is a response to that very narrative: the one that attempts to convince Black students that attending an HBCU cannot be beneficial in and of itself. The character depicted, thus, literally sits on top of the world, an idiom used to express sentiments of wonder and excitement. The high pigments and bold colors illustrate the liveliness of HBCU campuses across the country. While several of the elements included are not exclusive to my own experience, I wanted to showcase the many facets of this invaluable experience.  Bio:  Born and raised in New Rochelle, New York, Rachel Motley is an emerging digital illustrator.

On campus, she has served as the graphic designer for both the School of Business and the Howard University Student Association. Motley is also a member of the Freshman Leadership Academy, where she focuses on community and scholastics. Her decision to attend Howard University was largely influenced by the desire to be culturally submerged and connected with the legacy and history of those before her. She believes the best thing about attending an HBCU has been the support and the uplifting network within the HBCU community. After graduating, Motley hopes to continue as an independent artist who collaborates on products ranging from apparel and footwear to home decor.

This happiness stems from a desire to learn more about our heritage and the opportunity to participate in a legacy of greatness established by past alumni. I wanted to document this legacy by capturing students past and present in combination with major elements of HBCU campus culture, which are also major symbols of campus pride. My color scheme is centered around yellow because it is the color of joy. I enjoy experimenting with colors so a characteristic of all my art is how I blend them together to create light and depth. I knew I had to make color the central element of this piece. A concern of mine was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to include all the details I\u2019d imagined, but I\u2019m very happy with how much I accomplished and I\u2019m extremely proud of the finished product. Bio My name is Mia Moore and I am a senior Art \u2013 Electronic Studio major from The Woodlands, Texas currently attending the illustrious Howard University. I have channeled my passion for art into several projects such as my Girl Scout Gold Award where I established an art program at my local community center. Over the last four years I have participated in several on-campus art shows and I am currently working on building my professional portfolio through commissioned work. I was initially attracted to Howard because of its reputation as an epicenter of Black culture in America, but also because the environment was so different from the other colleges I visited. The impact of seeing people who look like me achieve success without having to forfeit their blackness or their cultural identity was an incomparable experience. It transformed my personality, my sense of artistic and personal style, and also improved my relationship with my racial identity. My favorite part of attending an HBCU is that the classes I\u2019ve taken incorporate and analyze the subject matter through the lens of the Black community. After I graduate I would like to attend art school and expand on my craft while continuing to create both traditional and digital art that shapes and emulates Black culture.

My creative process included scanning materials, painting, drawing, and photographing in the art studios at ASU. My artwork is a digital collage that uses symbolism and repetition of color to narrate the piece from left to right. Starting from the left of the piece, the viewer will see many references made to African ancestry and heritage. These references are reflected through a forest silhouette, an African necklace and the Eye of Horus. The forest indicates life, origin and growth. The African necklace is representative of African ancestry. The Eye of Horus is an African symbol of royalty and power. Additionally, the piece uses the repetition of red, yellow, green, orange and black to depict the historic usage of color in African artwork. Essentially, my usage of symbolism and repetition of color was to emphasize the fact that these elements of African heritage and culture persists through HBCU life today. Throughout the piece, the viewer will find multiple references made to HBCU sports, culture and academics. These references include a Black fist, basketball jersey, hair pick and graduation stole. The Black fist is a reference to social activism within the HBCU community. The jersey highlights the presence of sports in HBCU culture. The hair pick is a symbol about the importance of afro-textured hair. Lastly, the graduation stole is a symbol of accomplishment and excellence. Moreover, the graduation stole highlights the end of a student\u2019s journey at an HBCU. The focal point of the piece is the white face mask. It mainly represents the unprecedented hardships that COVID-19 has caused to students and faculty at HBCUs. The mask is intended to bring awareness to newfound and current problems for HBCUs, and represents the isolation associated with the experience of quarantine. Overall, the collection of these elements conveys a story of how the past connects to the present. I wanted to showcase that our historic roots are still relevant in our everyday life at our HBCUs.   Bio:  I am Woody Lofton. I am an artist and photographer based in Albany, Georgia. Ever since I was a kid, I was always fascinated by art. I started out drawing sketches and painting but as I matured as an artist I noticed more. Art for me became more personal and expressive and I wanted to make a statement. I found myself creating so much art that I decided that I would pursue an art career. I chose Albany State because I wanted to attend an HBCU and make an impact where I was from. I felt that Albany State University was a great place for me to learn more and become an even more impactful artist. Aside from drawing and painting, I found another art form that interested me while attending Albany State. I discovered photography. Photography has continued to be an integral part of my life and art at Albany State. I am thoroughly enjoying my time at Albany State. The best thing about attending an HBCU is the experience. You will meet great, talented, versatile and knowledgeable people. I will be graduating soon from Albany State University. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in teaching art. I ultimately plan to attend graduate school to receive my master\u2019s degree to become an art professor. As an artist, I want to build, grow, collaborate, and mentor other artists. With that being said, I\u2019m not limiting myself to just teaching art. I have a versatile skillset that I will continue to improve and expand beyond teaching art.

In her experience at Howard University, student-athletes are typically more students than they are athletes. As mentioned by alumni Vice President Kamala Harris, the star running back may also be a 4.0 computer engineering student. This duality can be explained by something that Black children hear often throughout their lives: you have to work twice as hard at all times. To this point, when the NBA contacted Jennings about creating this piece, she was experiencing the effects of the recent Houston snowstorm. Despite the situation, Jennings persevered and completed the artwork after relocating because her apartment didn\u2019t have water.  Bio:  Kennedy Jennings is a senior Public Relations major and African-American Studies minor at Howard University hailing from Houston, Texas. Before attending Howard University, Jennings had never stepped foot on the campus, yet was guided by her gut feeling that the grounds of the illustrious campus would water her roots and blossom her into the flower she is meant to be. Throughout her three-year-matriculation at the university, Jennings has fully submerged herself in her campus culture by joining and contributing largely to organizations on campus. She is a former head of graphic design and member of Ladies of The Quad Social Club, Models of the Mecca, HER Campus Howard and Howard University Texas Club. She is also a member of Howard Chapter NAACP and National Association of Black Journalists. Outside of academics, she is a social media and content intern for Broccoli City Festival. Jennings believes that the best part about going to a Historically Black University is being able to see the diversity of Black people across the diaspora. She enjoys gaining an understanding of fellow students\u2019 cultures that are influenced by their hometowns and ethnic backgrounds. She also enjoys the academic realm of HBCUs that allows for students to fully engage with their professors due to the lack of code-switching and respectability politics rooted in anti-Blackness. Many professors have shaped her into the person she is today, such as Attorney Minor, Dr. Carr, Dr. Blackmon, Dr. Hogan, and Professor Bubb. After graduation, she plans on returning to Houston to pursue either a master\u2019s degree in digital communications or a Juris Doctor at Texas Southern University. She anticipates becoming either a celebrity publicist or an entertainment\/civil rights attorney.

Giannis scored 22 points 9-20 shooting from the field, 2-7 on 3-pointers and 2-2 on free throws against Adams. He scored 14 points 5-6 shooting from the field and 4-5 from the free-throw line in 3:43 against all other defenders."},{"id":501403,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/myriad-questions-surround-bucks","date":"2021-02-25","title":"Bucks still finding way to win despite some new issues","content":"Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks recently snapped a 5-game losing streak. The view of the Milwaukee Bucks from 30,000 feet is tranquil enough, based on the team\u2019s ambitions for the 2020-21 regular season. It\u2019s the view from 30 feet that has so many fans nervous, media reps skeptical and opponents encouraged. When Milwaukee faces the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday night in the sixth game of its eight-game homestand, nearing completion of the season\u2019s first half, it will be lugging more questions than answers. That\u2019s not horrible, but it sure feels different. In going 116-39 over the past two regular seasons, the Bucks didn\u2019t necessarily have things figured out \u2014 it just seemed like it. Their collapse against Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals in 2019 after leading the best-of-seven series 2-0 and their abrupt dispatching by Miami in 2020 from the conference semifinals jolted and exposed a group that had romped through 82 games one season, 73 the next. The Bucks\u2019 19-13 season so far has been anything but a romp. Grind? At times. A meandering trudge through unknown woods with neither a map nor compass? That might be closer still. Funny thing is, as unnerving as it might be to the team and its followers \u2014 the Bucks would have to go 37-4 to match last season\u2019s record (and there aren\u2019t 41 games left) \u2014 it was kind of predictable. Take a look at some of Giannis Antetokounmpo's best plays in 2020-21. And even though it was kind of predictable, it still is a little unnerving. Milwaukee keeps flipping that coin, with no other heads\/tails outcome possible, frankly, until the middle of May. Such is life for a team whose success or failure has been shifted entirely to the postseason. For all the roster changes enacted by general manager Jon Horst in the short offseason, for any adjustments coach Mike Budenholzer has made offensively or defensively, for whatever enhancements reigning two-time Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and his teammates made to their individual skills, this eight-ton boulder was going to be blocking their road through the regular season: It\u2019s the playoffs, pallies. That\u2019s why figuring out which is the \u201creal\u201d Bucks team at the moment \u2014 the flat bunch who dropped five straight recently or the guys who sandwiched eight victories around that skid \u2014 isn\u2019t only challenging but sort of fruitless. What appeared to be so real the past two seasons turned out not to be. Looked like gold, finished like iron pyrite. In dropping five consecutive games from Feb. 10-18, losing to Phoenix, Utah, Oklahoma City and Toronto (twice), the Bucks shot 36.6% on 3-pointers and averaged 13 3-pointers. That\u2019s a long way from 42.9 percent and 16.4 , their numbers in victories. They averaged only 42.4 rebounds, committed 21 fouls per game and had ratings of 110.3\/118.3 . Their opponents shot a cumulative 50.3%, 39.9% on 3-pointers and shot 23.8 free throws per game on 120.4 ppg. The messages from Budenholzer and players throughout was to stay the course, learn and, as voiced by Antetokounmpo four losses in, not to panic. \u201cI say a lot of times when things go bad, that\u2019s where you get better,\u201d Antetokounmpo said when the skid hit five. \u201cThat\u2019s where you excel, that\u2019s where you improve. Or, you can turn the other way, just go home and quit. Or you can keep fighting.\u201d Somehow, the reassurances have been right, yet not all that convincing. The Bucks toppled the Thunder on Feb. 18 to end a 5-game skid. The current three-game win streak, by an average of 17.7 points, has been against OKC, Sacramento and Minnesota. So far, Milwaukee is 3-5 against Brooklyn, Boston, Indiana, Toronto and Miami (and has yet to play Philadelphia). The Bucks have bounced back to be one of only three teams that rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive rating (Utah and Phoenix are the others). They are among the top five in scoring, field-goal percentage, 3-point percentage, 3-pointers made per game, scoring differential and net rating. Yet they rank 24 th in defensive 3-point percentage, compared to 15 th last season. They are 1-9 when they get outshot, 5-13 when the other team shoots 45% or better. The Bucks have won only one game all season in which they failed to score 100 points. And they are 0-10 when trailing after three quarters, a true measure of flatness. Individually, there are few red flags. Antetokounmpo remains a force at both ends of the floor and will start again in his fifth All-Star Game. He and Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic are the only players averaging at least 25 points, 10 rebounds and five assists per game. Khris Middleton, who joined \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d as an All-Star the past two seasons, was considered a coaches\u2019 snub when he didn\u2019t land a reserve spot in 2021. He\u2019s statistically having a near-mirror season to 2019-20 (20.3 ppg, 5.7 apg) while again chasing that elusive 50\/40\/90 club in shooting percentages. (Only five players in NBA history have done it while averaging at least 20 points.) During the five-game losing streak, Middleton averaged 16.6 ppg and was a member of the 40\/30\/70 club. With major offseason acquisition Jrue Holiday out, Middleton faced some aggressive double-teaming and coughed up nearly as many turnovers (4.4) as he had assists (4.6). Holiday hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 6 due to health and safety protocols. His status to face his former Pelicans team Thursday was unclear. Milwaukee has gone 4-5 without him, even as Holiday and the Bucks were still adjusting to each other prior to his layoff. Center Brook Lopez has been more accurate than last season inside and out. Yet his scoring is off slightly, his free throw rate has declined and the second team All-Defensive pick in 2019-20 has a 46.2 block percentage (after 60.2% last season). Donte DiVincenzo\u2019s bouncy two-way play has been helpful, though his best role might be off the bench rather than starting at shooting guard with Wesley Matthews gone. The bench itself has been a mixed bag, with Bobby Portis as a feisty big with shooting range, D.J. Augustin sputtering with his shot and Torrey Craig finding minutes harder to come by. All of which leaves the Bucks where, exactly? They might be learning and improving. Could be pacing themselves to peak for the playoffs and fighting for some focus in the meantime. Mostly where they are now, though, seems to be in a quandary. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. In each of the last two seasons, the Milwaukee Bucks have set the NBA record for most 3-pointers allowed per game, allowing 13.1 per game in 2018-19 and 14.0 per game last season . This season, the Bucks are on pace to break the record again, but they\u2019re only fourth in most 3-pointers allowed per game at 14.4. Way \u201cahead of\u201d the pack are the New Orleans Pelicans, who are blasting the Bucks\u2019 record, having allowed 16.0 3s per game. We know that the league has been taking more 3s every year. This season, 39.5% of shots have come from 3-point range, up from 38.4% last season and just 22.2% 10 years ago. But the number of 3s that the Pelicans have allowed vs. the league average (12.9 per game) is also the highest in NBA history. In regard to their 3s allowed as a percentage of the league average (16.0 \/ 12.9), it\u2019s the highest mark in the last nine years, since the 2011-12 Denver Nuggets allowed 135% more 3s than the league average. Most 3-pointers allowed vs. league average, last 20 seasons (since 2001-02) And that\u2019s with the Pels in the bottom 10 in pace . On a per-possession basis , the gap between them and the Charlotte Hornets is even bigger. The Pelicans are the only team that rank in the bottom five in both opponent 3-point percentage (39.3%, 28th) and the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from 3-point range (46%, 28th). And with the New Orleans offense below the league average in both 3-point percentage and the percentage of their own shots that have come from 3-point range , the Pelicans have been outscored by a league-worst 12.5 points per game from beyond the arc. Zion Williamson has been a force inside \u2014 his 19.0 points in the paint per game is the highest mark (by a wide margin) of the last 18 years \u2014 but that\u2019s a big deficit to make up. So what\u2019s going on with the New Orleans defense? Well, things have changed in the last week. But let\u2019s start with what was going on with the New Orleans defense. For most of their first 29 games, when the opponent ran pick-and-roll, the Pels brought their bigs up to the level of the screen, instead of keeping him in the paint like most other teams. With that, they pulled their weak-side low defenders all the way into the paint. Note how far Brandon Ingram ventures away from Nicolas Batum in the left corner in order to \u201ctag\u201d Serge Ibaka\u2019s roll\u2026 That left the Pelicans vulnerable on the weak side. And good playmakers were able to take advantage. It wasn\u2019t an effort issue most of the time; the defense was just too stretched out, and the opponents were getting too many shots that were open and in rhythm. Through last Friday, 88% of Pels\u2019 opponents\u2019 3-pointers, the league\u2019s fourth highest opponent rate, were assisted. The breaking point was the fourth quarter of their loss to Phoenix on Friday night, when Chris Paul and the Suns did this\u2026 And this\u2026 And this\u2026 At that point, the Pels ranked 29th in defensive efficiency, even though they were in the top 10 in opponent free throw rate and defensive rebounding percentage. So, on Sunday afternoon against the Celtics, the Pelicans began dropping their bigs back on pick-and-rolls\u2026 They had other issues in falling behind by 24 points and they defended pick-and-rolls more aggressively as they came all the way back to win in overtime. But the Pels allowed the Celtics to make just 10 3s, and they were back in the drop coverage in their win over Detroit on Wednesday. They haven\u2019t quite stopped the bleeding (the Pistons made seven threes in the first quarter), but they\u2019ve reduced it a bit. The number of 3-pointers that they\u2019ve allowed per game has already dropped from 16.3 (through Friday) to 16.0. The Pels now face the team whose record they\u2019re breaking. They visit the Bucks on Thursday ( 9:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), when the focus will be on the league\u2019s two leading scorers in the paint . Giannis Antetokounmpo will put a lot of stress on the New Orleans defense, but the key going forward could be how much stress that defense puts on itself. Now, there are certain ball-handlers against which you can\u2019t drop your bigs. Damian Lillard is either 1a or 1b on that list. And like Stephen Curry, Lillard knows how to leverage his shooting to get open shots or layups for his teammates. Still, it\u2019s not often that you see a team get two consecutive layups off the same play, because the defense usually makes an adjustment to clean up what went wrong the first time. You certainly don\u2019t see it often against a top-10 defense. But the Blazers did just that in the second quarter of their game in Phoenix on Monday, running a fairly common \u201c wedge \u201d play. Anfernee Simons set a screen for Enes Kanter, who then set a ball screen for Damian Lillard to attack the middle of the floor from the left side. Because Lillard is a threat to shoot from 30 feet, Deandre Ayton (guarding Kanter) ventured out beyond the 3-point line. And because the left corner was empty, Chris Paul had to come from the weak side to help on Kanter\u2019s roll. Derrick Jones Jr. followed behind Paul and caught a lob from Lillard\u2026 On the next possession, the Blazers ran the same play and got the same result\u2026 On the next possession, the Blazers ran the same play on the other side of the floor. This time, Lillard immediately passed the ball to Kanter on the roll. Dario Saric rotated from the weak side, and both Paul and Devin Booker rotated down to Jones\u2019 dive behind Saric. That left both Robert Covington and Gary Trent Jr. open, but Kanter\u2019s kick-out pass to Trent sailed wide and Booker was able to recover\u2026 Looking back at the first two plays, when Paul rotated over from the weak side, it seems that Saric should have rotated down, because Jones at the rim is a bigger problem than an open shooter on the wing. Typically, with that rotation, the remaining weak-side defender (Booker) will split the distance between the two shooters, so that he doesn\u2019t have a long rotation to either. For the most part, that was a solid defensive game from the Suns, who held the Blazers\u2019 seventh-ranked offense to just 100 points on 95 possessions. But it was interesting to see them get beat for layups by the same play on two consecutive possessions. That\u2019s the kind of pressure that great off-the-dribble shooting and an empty-corner pick-and-roll can put on a defense. Phoenix, No. 4 in this week\u2019s Power Rankings , lost to Charlotte on Wednesday, but has still won 12 of its last 15 games and remains one of three teams that rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The Suns begin a three-game trip in Chicago on Friday (8 p.m. ET, League Pass) and have a big game against the Lakers on Tuesday (10 p.m. ET, TNT). The Blazers may be slipping out of the top 10, having lost three straight . They\u2019re completing a three-game trip in L.A. , facing the Lakers on Friday (10 p.m. ET, ESPN). In the second game of the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 two-game series with the Golden State Warriors a few weeks ago, Luka Doncic hit two clutch 3s to help secure a win. And these shots were not like normal Doncic 3-point attempts, because they were both off the catch. If there\u2019s a weakness in Doncic\u2019s offensive game, it\u2019s his 3-point shooting. He has shot just 32.6% from beyond the arc in his career, in part because his 3s come with a high degree of difficulty, mostly off the dribble and often with a step-back. So when he made those two catch-and-shoot 3s down the stretch against the Warriors, it begged the question: What if the Mavericks had another playmaker and Doncic was able to shoot more off the catch? According to Second Spectrum tracking, only 20% of Doncic\u2019s 3-point attempts have been catch-and-shoot 3s. That\u2019s the third lowest rate among 134 players with at least 100 total 3-point attempts. Lowest percentage of 3s coming off the catch, 2020-21 Minimum 100 total 3PA But you\u2019ll notice that Doncic has actually shot better on pull-up 3s (36.3%) than he has on catch-and-shoot 3s (32.5%). So he\u2019s been better than the league average (34.6%) off the dribble and worse than the league average (37.9%) off the catch. That 32.5% mark ranks 210th among 250 players with at least 35 catch-and-shoot attempts. Last season, he was worse on catch-and-shoot 3s: 28-for-75 (28.0%). Maybe Doncic would be better off the catch with more reps, and maybe he\u2019s just more comfortable shooting off the dribble. When he hit two huge 3s in the final minute to beat the Celtics on Tuesday, they were both step-backs. As a rookie, Doncic was 6-for-11 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. Over the last two seasons, he\u2019s 5-for-18, and all five makes have come in two games: He was 3-for-3 in Game 4 against the Clippers in August, and he was 2-for-2 on Tuesday. Doncic and the Mavericks are in Philadelphia for the first game of TNT\u2019s doubleheader on Thursday (7 p.m. ET). They\u2019re then in Brooklyn for the ABC game on Saturday night (8:30 p.m. ET). In this space last week , we broke down a couple of \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cstack\u201d pick-and-roll plays from the Suns. And on Monday, the Grizzlies got creative with a Spain variant of their own out of a timeout. It looked a little like a \u201cdouble-drag\u201d screen, except the screens were both set inside the 3-point line\u2026 Kyle Anderson screens Ja Morant\u2019s defender (Josh Richardson) and then Brandon Clarke screens Anderson\u2019s defender (Doncic) at the elbow. Maxi Kleber retreats to Clarke\u2019s roll and there\u2019s nobody to stop Morant\u2019s drive. If Kleber does step up, Morant either has the lob to Clarke or Grayson Allen open on the weak side. Here are the players who\u2019ve seen the biggest jumps in usage rate from last season, along with how those jumps have affected their true shooting percentage (scoring efficiency) \u2026 Biggest jumps in usage rate Usg% = Percentage of a team\u2019s possessions a player uses (via field goal attempts, turnovers and trips to the line) while he\u2019s on the floor TS% = PTS \/ (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA))) Minimum 500 minutes played in each of the last two seasons The very top of the list should be no surprise. Jerami Grant has been given the keys in Detroit. Interesting is that the guy who replaced him in Denver \u2014 JaMychal Green \u2014 is also in the top 10. There are four Thunder players in the top 10 and another three \u2014 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kenrich Williams and Mike Muscala \u2014 in the next 10. All three of those guys (along with Dort, Horford and Diallo) have seen jumps in true shooting percentage, yet the Thunder still rank last in offensive efficiency . The biggest drop in usage rate ( from 35.6% to 26.9% ) belongs to James Harden. But note that usage rate doesn\u2019t take assists into account, and Harden has seen a big jump in his assist ratio, from 19.4 to 32.3 per 100 possessions used. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Whether they are All-Star teammates depends on next week\u2019s draft, but they have both shined when facing one another this season. In their last meeting on Jan. 6 , Beal scored a career-best 60 points, but it was not enough as Embiid stuffed the stat sheet with 38 points, eight rebounds, five assists, three steals and three blocks to lead the Sixers to a 141-136 win. Here\u2019s the list of players that have hit all five of those marks in a game while playing fewer than 40 minutes : Embiid (2021), Dirk Nowitzki (2007), Shaquille O\u2019Neal (2001), Hakeem Olajuwon (1993), Patrick Ewing (1987). Portland at Minnesota (8 ET) Carmelo Anthony can take the next step up the all-time scoring leaderboard against the Timberwolves; he has Hakeem Olajuwon in his sights, for 11th place all-time. Anthony currently needs an even 100 points to pass Olajuwon and if maintains his currently level of scoring (15.3 ppg across 13 games in February), he would be on track to reach that mark in this game. Sacramento at Charlotte (7 ET) This is the first in a number of games to watch centered around the race for Rookie of the Year. As the NBA.com Kia Rookie Ladder suggests, the competition is tight between Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball, Sacramento\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton, Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards \u2014 and now that he\u2019s healthy and back on the court, Golden State\u2019s James Wiseman. Ball leads all rookies in points, assists and steals, while Haliburton ranks third in points, second in assists and steals, and first in 3-pointers made. LA Clippers at Dallas (9 ET) This is a rematch of last year\u2019s first-round playoff matchup, which the Clippers won, 4-2. The Mavericks won the first meeting with the Clippers this season in spectacular fashion as they led by an NBA-record 50 points at the half and finished with a 124-73 win for their first victory of the season on December 27. Both teams were missing a key player in the first meeting: Kawhi Leonard for LA and Kristaps Porzingis for Dallas. Dallas at Portland (10 ET) Luka vs. Dame. Two of the top five scorers in the league \u2013 Lillard is fourth at 29.6 ppg and Luka is right behind at 28.9 ppg. Both players also have a penchant for delivering clutch baskets in big moments. In the final minute of a one-possession game (ahead or behind 3 points), Lillard is 6-for-10 from the field, 2-for-4 from 3 and 8-for-8 from the free-throw line; Luka is 5-for-9 from the filed, 2-for-5 from 3 and has four assists. In their first meeting of the season on February 14, Lillard scored 34 points \u2014 including a step-back three with 32 seconds left to break a tie and put the Blazers up for good \u2013 despite Luka scoring 44 points. Golden State at Sacramento (10 ET) Another game featuring two of the top rookies of the season in Golden State\u2019s Wiseman (drafted No. 2 overall) and Sacramento\u2019s Haliburton (No. 12th). Wiseman had 10 points and five rebounds in the Warriors win over the Kings on January 4 in a game that Haliburton missed due to injury. Of course in addition to the rookies, you also have two of the top 3-point shooters in the game with Stephen Curry (158 3PM; 1st) and Buddy Hield (115; 3rd) both in the top three in 3-pointers made this season. Minnesota at Brooklyn (7:30 ET) James Harden currently sits in fifth place all-time in 3-pointers made with 2,409 in 860 games played. He needs 42 treys to pass Kyle Korver for fourth place and at his current 3-point rate \u2014 since joining the Nets (3.2 3PM per game in 19 games) \u2014 it would take Harden 14 games to pass Korver. That 14th game would come against the Timberwolves in Brooklyn. At his current pace, Harden would need 48 games to pass Reggie Miller for third place all time. That\u2019s nine more games than are left on the schedule for the Nets this season. Philadelphia at New Orleans (8 ET) When looking at the second half schedule, there were games that stood out because of potential awards races or playoff implications and there are others that just have matchups that everyone wants to see. Zion Williamson vs. Joel Embiid. Two of the most physically dominant and skilled big men in the game today will square off for the first time in April. This is their first meeting of the 2020-21 season; Zion missed the only matchup against Philly in his rookie season. Golden State at Washington (7 ET) This is a matchup of the top two scorers in the NBA so far this season \u2013 Bradley Beal (32.7 ppg) and Stephen Curry (30.2 ppg). Stephen Curry won the NBA scoring title during his second MVP season in 2015-16 (30.1 ppg) and Beal is still looking for his first scoring title in his ninth season. Beal\u2019s scoring has steadily risen over the past four seasons from 22.6 ppg in 2017-18, to 25.6 in 2018-19, 30.5 in 2019-20 and 32.7 this season. Beal is on pace to become only the 15th player in NBA history to average at least 32 points over a season. Phoenix at Boston (7 ET) On Saturday, Chris Paul passed Oscar Robertson to climb to sixth place on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists list . His next target is Magic Johnson as Paul needs 242 assists to pass the Lakers\u2019 legend. Paul currently ranks fifth in the league in assists at 8.5 per game for the Suns. If he maintains that pace, he would need 29 games to pass Magic for fifth place. Assuming good health and playing each game, Paul would be on target to pass Magic against the Celtics on April 22. Golden State at Minnesota (8 ET) The last in our series of games looking at the top rookies in this year\u2019s class features a matchup of the top two picks in the 2020 Draft: No. 1 Anthony Edwards and No. 2 James Wiseman. Each has had moments to shine, with Edwards\u2019 entry for Dunk of the Year over weekend setting a bar that will be tough to beat. Wiseman just returned to the Warriors lineup after missing nearly four weeks due to injury; he had 14 points in 16 minutes in first game back. Portland at Cleveland (7 ET) It\u2019s another episode of milestone watch with Carmelo Anthony, who can climb into the top 10 all-time in scoring this season by passing Elvin Hayes (27,313 career points). Carmelo needs 467 points to pass Hayes; if he maintains his season scoring average (13.4 ppg), he would pass Hayes in 35 games, which would come on May 5 in Cleveland. Carmelo has increased his scoring in February, helping make up for the absence of CJ McCollum , who is out with the broken foot. But with McCollum set to return in the next few weeks, Carmelo\u2019s scoring may return to his season average as the season progresses. Phoenix at Atlanta (8 ET) The all-time assist list isn\u2019t the only leaderboard that Chris Paul is climbing this season. He currently ranks seventh all-time in steals and if he maintains his current pace (1.2 spg), he can scale up to fifth during this matchup in Atlanta. Paul needs 40 steals to pass Scottie Pippen for sixth place and 43 steals to pass Maurice Cheeks for fifth place. It would take Paul 34 games to pass Pippen (Target game: May 2 at OKC), and 36 games to pass Cheeks. If Paul can break into the top five in both all-time steals and assists, he would join John Stockton (first in both) and Jason Kidd (second in both). Los Angeles Lakers at Portland (10 ET) This matchup has multiple layers to break down: First, it is a rematch of last year\u2019s first round series, which the Lakers won in six games after Portland crawled their way into the postseason by winning the first-ever Western Conference Play-In; second, it is a meeting of two of this season\u2019s top MVP candidates as LeBron James and Damian Lillard rank first and third, respectively, in the latest edition of the Kia MVP Ladder . Finally, LeBron James can reach another milestone as this is the target game for him to pass Oscar Robertson for seventh place all-time in assists . LeBron needs 283 assists to pass Robertson and, based on his current season average (8.1 apg; 8th in NBA), he would reach his mark in 35 games. Miami at Boston (7 ET) We close out the list with another 2020 Playoff rematch, this time the Eastern Conference finals between the Heat and Celtics; Miami won in six games to reach the NBA Finals for the first time since 2014. Both the Heat (14-17; 10th in East) and Celtics (15-16; 6th in East) have some work to do as they hope to avoid the Play-In Tournament and secure a playoff berth to initiate another deep run. In their first meeting of the season, Jayson Tatum (27 points) and Jaylen Brown (21 points, 12 rebounds) combined for 48 points and rookie Payton Pritchard hit the game-winning tip-in with 0.2 seconds left as the Celtics prevailed, 107-105 ."},{"id":501083,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-dorts-dagger-3-beats-buzzer-to-rattle-spurs","date":"2021-02-25","title":"Horry Scale: Dort's dagger 3 beats buzzer to rattle Spurs","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. The game featured 13 lead changes and 7 ties, so what was one more at the buzzer? After a back-and-forth four quarters on Wednesday left the Thunder and Spurs tied at 99 in the final minute, a missed shot and a crushing, self-inflicted turnover set up Oklahoma City on the frontcourt sideline just 3.9 seconds from the finish. Inbounds, assist, open triple. All she wrote. GAME SITUATION: The Spurs, who last led 88-87 with 6:16 to play, threatened several times from that point to retake control, ultimately tying the game at 99 on a finger roll from Lonnie Walker IV. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had had shot 13-for-19 while scoring a career-high 42, then bricked a pullup 3. The Spurs rebounded and called for time, inbounding with 10.7 seconds left. Patty Mills, looking for an opening on the right wing, clamped his dribble with both hands while changing direction. The double-dribble call and a timeout left the Thunder a final shot in regulation. DIFFICULTY: After crossing screens sent shooters to the corners, Al Horford \u2014 posted at the nail \u2014 came toward the ball. Driving right off the catch from Gilgeous-Alexander, Horford took two dribbles to draw help defender Patty Mills. Dort, 5-for-11 from the field and 3-for-7 from 3 to that point, had all the time on the clock to line up and fire away, not a man between him and the rim. CELEBRATION: Dort watched the shot fall, then dropped to the floor, arms spread and smiling wide. Across the court, his teammates were already rushing off the bench as the ball swished through. Pileup party time for OKC. GRADE: Regular season, second chance, gifted opportunity. Wiiiiiiide open. Might as well have been shooting alone on the playground. Solid, if unspectacular.

Booker has earned his second straight NBA All-Star selection. He is averaging a team-high 24.7 points (16 th in the NBA), 4.3 assists and 3.8 rebounds while shooting a career-high 50.1 percent from the field, 38.1 percent from three-point range and 84.8 percent from the free throw line in 26 games this season. Behind Booker and fellow NBA All-Star Chris Paul, Phoenix has posted the league\u2019s fourth-best record (20-10) and produced its best start through 30 games of a season since 2007-08. With the selection of Booker and Paul, the Suns have multiple NBA All-Stars in a season for the first time since 2009-10 (Steve Nash and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire). Davis will miss the NBA All-Star Game after sustaining a right calf strain against the Denver Nuggets on Feb. 14. He was voted by NBA head coaches as an All-Star reserve, his eighth consecutive All-Star selection. Davis is averaging 22.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.78 blocks in 23 games this season. According to NBA rules, when a player selected to the All-Star Game is unable to participate, the Commissioner shall choose a replacement from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Davis and Booker both play for Western Conference teams. The NBA All-Star Game rosters will be determined through the NBA All-Star Draft, where team captains Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets and LeBron James of the Lakers will select from the pool of players named starters and reserves in each conference. TNT will air the NBA All-Star Draft on Thursday, March 4 at 8 p.m. ET. In the two-round NBA All-Star Draft, Booker will be selected with the All-Star Game reserves in the second round.

Meanwhile, he\u2019ll face a Rockets team that remains without Christian Wood and just cut DeMarcus Cousins. Allen will have to play on the wrong end of a back-to-back, but he\u2019s young enough for that not to matter. Dejounte Murray (PG \u2013 SAS) at OKC $7,500  Murray is one of two Spurs starters with a chance to play, and the other, LaMarcus Aldridge, is questionable. He is one of four healthy guards on the roster. That\u2019ll thrust him into a high-volume role against the Thunder tonight, and no matter how low the final score ends up being, Murray should account for a ton of San Antonio\u2019s offensive production. Thaddeus Young (PF \u2013 CHI) vs. MIN $6,600  I struggled to find a good power forward on this slate. Our DraftKings correspondent, Joel Bartilotta, couldn\u2019t find one, either. My logic with this play is that the Timberwolves give up the most FDPPG to centers \u2014 even with Karl-Anthony Towns back in the lineup \u2014 and Young spends half of his time at the five. He has also hit or hovered around 5x value for his last five games. Al Horford (C- OKC) vs. SAS $6,100  If this game gets played, the Spurs won\u2019t have several bigs, and Horford could be lined up against Jakob Poeltl and Drew Eubanks. That makes him a smart target on this slate, especially at such a low price, because the Thunder should be content to take most of their points from inside the paint. Coby White (PG \u2013 CHI) vs. MIN $5,700  I don\u2019t understand the White disrespect. White has hit 5x value against this price in his two most recent games. He has hit that value threshold in four of his last seven, too, with two of the misses coming in games that he missed part of due to in-game injuries. The Timberwolves give up the 12th-most FDPPG to point guards, and White should be in for another big game. Mikal Bridges (SF \u2013 PHO) vs. CHA $5,500  I also struggled to find a low-priced small forward on this slate, so we\u2019re stuck with Bridges. He\u2019ll take on the Charlotte Hornets, who give up the ninth-most FDPPG to the position, and he\u2019ll probably line up against a banged-up Gordon Hayward. Bridges\u2019 minutes have ticked down in recent days, but I have faith that Monty Williams was just giving his key players a bit of rest. Wendell Carter Jr. (C \u2013 CHI) vs. MIN $5,400  Again, the Timberwolves give up the most FDPPG to centers, and Carter just throttled the Boogie-less Rockets for 47.1 FD points (8.7x value against this price). He may not hit that ceiling again, but he\u2019s a smart player to feature in what should be a high-scoring contest. Saben Lee (PG \u2013 DET) at NOR $5,000  Lee has taken over at point guard for the Pistons with Delon Wright sidelined, and he has dropped 32-plus FD points in consecutive games (6.4x value). He\u2019s a safe bet for similar production against the Pelicans, as they give up the third-most FDPPG to point guards. Luguentz Dort (SG \u2013 OKC) vs. SAS $4,400  With San Antonio\u2019s banged-up roster, they won\u2019t be able to maintain their sixth-best defense against shooting guards. Dort just needs 22 points to hit value here, and he has hit that threshold in five of his last eight appearances. Lonnie Walker IV (SG \u2013 SAS) at OKC $3,500  The Spurs are pressed for depth at guard, and Walker should end up getting a bunch of minutes behind Murray and Patty Mills. Walker posted some impressive numbers earlier in the year \u2014 including a 32.6 FD point (9.3x value against this price) showing against the Thunder \u2014 and he is the slate\u2019s best value play at his minimum salary."},{"id":500629,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-wednesday-feb-24-2021","date":"2021-02-24","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021","content":"Warriors (17-15) at Pacers (15-14)  7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 The Pacers won their first meeting with the Warriors on Jan. 12 behind double-doubles from Domantas Sabonis (18 pts, 14 reb, 6 ast), Myles Turner (22 pts, 12 reb, 6 blk) and Aaron Holiday (16 pts, 12 ast, 2 stl). Sabonis ranks second in the league in double-doubles with 22 on the season. \u2022 The Pacers held Stephen Curry to 20 points \u2013 his fifth lowest-scoring game in 31 played this season. The Warriors are 2-5 this season when Curry scores fewer than 25 points. \u2022 In their first meeting, Edmond Sumner was the primary defender on Stephen Curry for a team-high 4:38 (42% of Curry\u2019s offensive matchup time) and held him scoreless on 0-2 shooting. Justin Holiday allowed Curry five points on 1-3 FG, 2-2 FT in 2:35 of matchup time and Malcolm Brogdon allowed no points on 0-2 shooting in 1:48. \u2022 T.J.

No other player in the top 10 leaders in steals averages fewer than 28 minutes per game. \u2022 Stephen Curry ranks second in the NBA in scoring with a career-best 30.2 points per game.

Lakers (22-10) at Jazz (25-6)  10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 The Jazz are the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive efficiency (116.6, 4th) and defensive efficiency (107.1, 2nd). While the Lakers have the top-ranked defense in the league (105.5), they rank 15th on offensive (111.5). \u2022 After dropping each game of a three-game homestand, the Lakers return to the friendly confines of the road. So far this season, the Lakers are 9-7 at home (11th in NBA) and 13-3 on the road (1st in NBA). The key to the Lakers\u2019 road success has been their defense as they have a league-best 103.8 defensive rating on the road compared to fifth-ranked 107.1 at home. \u2022 This is the first meeting of the season between the Jazz and Lakers, with Los Angeles winning the past four matchups dating back to March 2019. The Lakers swept the three-game series last season with LeBron James averaging 24.7 points on 50.8% shooting and 10.3 assists per game. Anthony Davis (who will miss Wednesday\u2019s game due to injury) led the Lakers with 29.7 ppg vs. Utah. \u2022 The Jazz lead the NBA in 3-pointers made (16.8 per game) and attempted (42.5 per game) and rank third in 3-point percentage (39.7%). The Lakers hold opponents to 34.9% shooting from 3-point range, which is the third-lowest percentage allowed in the league. \u2022 The Jazz average a league-high 25.2 points per game on pick-and-roll ball handler plays. The Jazz and Mavericks are tied for the league-lead not only in pick-and-roll ball handler plays run per game (25.0), but they are also the most efficient, scoring 1.01 points per possession on those plays.

It\u2019s an everyday challenge in the NBA, across teams and individuals, veterans and newbies, on the court and in the verbiage that promotes or explains what we see out there. When it comes to rookies, we\u2019re far more likely to see the former in the form of highlight plays and memorable moments. In fact, we tend to crave style, reveling in the potential that we glimpse in that while acknowledging that the consistency that\u2019s part of substance is tougher to come by for guys getting their first taste of the pro life \u2014 and huge step up in competitive level. Few instances have typified the vs. part rather than any premature and on the style\/substance spectrum than Anthony Edwards\u2019 incredible dunk against the Toronto Raptors Friday night. Instantly proclaimed to be the \u201cDunk of the Year\u201d across social media, Edwards charged from the corner along the left baseline, went airborne, cocked back his arm and threw down his thunderous shot over Toronto forward Yuta Watanabe. The greater NBA community went wild, racing to flood the airwaves and Internet with photos, video clips and GIFs. It was worth seeing and spoke to how entertaining Edwards in particular has been this season and this league so often is in its peak experiences. What got way less attention was the fact that Edwards shot 3-of-14 in that game , missed all seven of his 3-point attempts, scored only seven points and posted a minus-13. Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but Minnesota lost that game to fall to 7-23 at the bottom of the Western Conference. And two days, after losing in New York, the Timberwolves fired coach Ryan Saunders and gave Edwards his second NBA coach already by hiring Chris Finch off the Raptors\u2019 bench. Edwards\u2019 first season has been like that. He has tremendous athletic ability, an ability to aggressively attack the rim and an engaging personality about it all. He also frequently gets caught in the air, fighting gravity with no plan, and has coin-flip odds of making the right pass\/shoot decisions. The job of polishing Edwards as a cornerstone for Minnesota\u2019s future falls now to a guy who happened to see the dunk in person. Finch has a reputation as an offensive guru, which suggests bright things for the likes of Karl-Anthony Towns, D\u2019Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley and most of all Edwards. Keeping the rookie moving when he doesn\u2019t have the ball would be a nice start, by the way. \u201cThe Dunk\u201d electrified fans, players and media around the league. But Edwards\u2019 overall play actually had him slip a rung on this week\u2019s Ladder. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Tuesday, Feb. 22) Season stats: 14.6 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 6.1 apg  Since last Ladder: 14.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 5.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 Ball followed up his 34-point game vs. Utah earlier this month with 21 Monday, though he got carried away when he taunted Jazz veteran Mike Conley after taking him to the rim. Kids, right? Hopefully the No. 3 pick will focus more on the Hornets getting pasted by Utah by a total of 39 points in their two meetings. One of eight rookies in NBA history to average at least 10 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.5 steals through his first 30 games. Season stats: 13.1 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 15.7 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Haliburton\u2019s consistent contributions \u2014 as Kings backcourt mates De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield have ups and downs \u2014 has some wondering if the No. 12 pick in 2020 should be starting. His 17.5 ppg scoring average since last Ladder led all rookies. He ranks third in scoring and second in assists among the newcomers , while shooting 44.2% from the arc with a 3.57 assist\/turnover ratio. \u201cI feel good where I\u2019m at, I know there\u2019s a whole other level to my game \u2014 a level that nobody\u2019s ever seen,\u201d Haliburton said recently. Season stats: 14.1 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 2.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 13.8 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 4.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 2 We covered a lot of \u201cAnt\u201d hills up above. From last week\u2019s Ladder through Monday, the No. 1 overall pick in November had shot 22.5% from the field and 17.6% on 3-pointers. Season stats: 9.9 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.8 apg  Since last Ladder: 15.5 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 5 Snubbed entirely in a recent ranking of rookies by The Athletic , Tate has overcome a lot more than that \u2014 from a rough childhood to injuries to tours overseas \u2014 to reach this rung. He has a 61.2 true-shooting percentage, 0.120 defensive win shares that ranks first among rotation rookies and an average of 6.6 points in the paint, second only to Golden State 7-footer and No. 2 pick James Wiseman. Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 7.0 ppg, 1.5 rpg, 0.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 4 That whole thing about rookies not getting calls doesn\u2019t apply much to Quickley. In fact, getting to the foul line and making his free throws (78 of 84, 92.9%) is one of his best traits so far. In his first 25 games, Quickley scored more from the line (69 points) than notable Knicks rookies such as Walt Frazier and Mark Jackson. 6. Saddiq Bey, Detroit Pistons Season stats: 9.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.0 apg  Since last Ladder: 11.7 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 6 Eight consecutive games scoring in double figures.  7. Patrick Williams, Chicago Bulls Season stats: 10.1 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.2 apg  Since last Ladder: 10.3 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 7 Teammates loving his \u201cstone cold\u201d court demeanor.  8. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats: 10.0 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 1.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.7 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 0.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 9 Net rating (4.1) second among rookies of 20+ games to Denver\u2019s Campazzo.  9. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers Season stats: 7.9 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 1.9 apg  Since last Ladder: 11.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Tested by opponents\u2019 top threats almost nightly.  10. Xavier Tillman, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats: 7.8 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 7.0 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Shoots better off the bench than as spot starter. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Quite literally, actually. By separating itself from society and resuming the 2019-20 season under tight security, the league set up shop in Orlando and allowed basketball to happen. Which it did \u2014 safely and often spectacularly. The \u201cbubble\u201d was by all accounts a success mainly because there was no health fallout. The season continued, a champion was crowned and everyone returned home safely. Left behind were the footprints of heroes and goats and moments to be savored and also forgotten. In that sense, the bubble was like any other postseason on the floor, although not in the stands (no fans) and logistics (no travel). Whatever became of those players and teams who rose or fell? To revisit the bubble and study the aftermath, we\u2019ve listed 15 people and teams who made the most news in Orlando last summer, and how they\u2019ve transitioned from then to now: Then: He averaged 36 points, shot 53-52-95% shooting splits, with almost five assists and five rebounds in Utah\u2019s classic seven-game series with the Nuggets, also known as the epic duel with Jamal Murray when Mitchell dropped a pair of 50-pieces and a 44-pointer. Now: Mitchell is the vortex of the team with the NBA\u2019s best record and is an All-Star again. The carryover from the bubble is smooth and at times efficient \u2014 he can be a bit streaky with the shot \u2014 and he\u2019s helping Utah put the league on notice, at least here in the regular season. Also, he\u2019s no longer giving Rudy Gobert the silent treatment, which is good. Then: The Heat pulled a bit of a surprise by reaching The Finals, dropping only three games in the East playoffs and briefly causing perspiration on the foreheads of the Lakers. Jimmy Butler screamed a lot and Tyler Herro snarled. Now: Stuck playing under .500 ball, Miami is the biggest disappointment since the bubble. Folks who brought the hype about the Heat \u201cculture\u201d are suddenly feeling duped. Butler has played well yet missed almost three weeks of the season. Bam Adebayo is trying to pick up the slack in vain. How rough is it? Miami recently lost to the LA Clippers without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, fell to East basement dwellers Washington and Detroit, and scored just 85 points against Brooklyn back when the Nets played no D. Then: Murray was a top-five player who scorched nightly. He had a pair of 50-pointers against Utah (142 points in a three-game stretch), led the historic rally against the Clippers with 40 in the closer, then drew the respect of LeBron James before running out of gas in the West finals. Now: Those who suspected Murray\u2019s breakout would translate into Kia MVP consideration for 2020-21 or at least an All-Star spot have lost that bet; neither will happen. It\u2019s not as if Murray is cratering, though. Aside from his recent 50-pointer (without a free throw attempt!), he\u2019s back to riding shotgun next to Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets, therefore, are middle-of-the-packers in the West. Then: The restart MVP \u2014 yes, there was actually an award for that \u2014 saw his reputation soar after multiple pull-up shots from the logo, when he had a vicious reply to his haters both real and in his head. He had games of 51 and 61 points in the resumed regular season\/play-in schedule. Now: Dame is challenging for the NBA scoring lead by once again reaching his typical high level, and some nights exceeding it (43 points and 16 assists against the Pelicans). He has already rescued the Blazers in a handful of wins with big shots in the final seconds or minutes \u2014 and sticking yet another wet finger in the ear of those Clippers who tapped their wrists and mocked \u201cDame Time\u201d in the bubble. Then: George was the poster child for disaster in Orlando, struggling on the court and with the restrictions off it. When he engaged in a regretful back-and-forth with Lillard, social media sided squarely with Dame. George then came up empty late in Game 7 against the Nuggets, and his side-of-the-backboard-hitting shot in the final moments quickly became a meme. Now: Redemption was on George\u2019s mind from the season-opening tip and he\u2019s following through, with very efficient shooting and his usual solid defense. He\u2019s an All-Star again but skeptics are crossing their arms and waiting for the postseason before extending forgiveness. Then: The Clippers dealt with Montrezl Harrell\u2019s long absence following his grandmother\u2019s death, and Lou Williams\u2019 fateful stop at a strip club while attending a funeral. They then proceeded to bumble through the playoffs, finally crashing in the West semifinals, ever so shockingly, after leading Denver 3-1. Now: Under the new leadership of coach Ty Lue, the Clippers look re-energized and motivated. They\u2019re getting the usual star turn from George and Leonard while the supporting cast is fairly solid for the most part. They might finish with the best record in the West. Then: Davis erased a career\u2019s worth of postseason misery by hitting a massive game-winning and series-changing jumper against the Nuggets in the West finals, then co-piloting the Lakers in The Finals for his first title. Now: AD is being haunted by the injury bug once again, this time dealing with a calf issue that\u2019ll keep him out until after the All-Star break. Before the injury, his performance was sporadic. Of course, none of this is a worry right now for a team with title aspirations. Then: Another title and another Finals MVP was secured by LeBron, who in the process turned the volume up on the GOAT debate between him and you-know-who. Now: Still refusing to surrender to age and tread wear, LeBron remains frisky in Year 17 and relying more on his improved shooting range to extend his value and impact in the game. He hasn\u2019t won a Kia MVP in eight years but he\u2019s putting himself in the favorite\u2019s chair at the moment with consistent and high-level play. Then: Caldwell-Pope endeared himself to skeptical Lakers fans by making defenses pay for doubling LeBron and Davis. Late in the fourth quarter of a crucial Game 4 of The Finals, he scored five straight points to capture the victory. Now: KCP remains a valued piece of the rotation, and the Lakers\u2019 most reliable 3-point shooter. However, he\u2019s dropping in the supporting cast pecking order to newcomer Dennis Schroder and even Harrell in terms of touches (he\u2019s eighth on the Lakers this season after ranking fifth last season). He\u2019s averaging 9 ppg, his lowest since his rookie season in 2013-14. Then: Van Gundy was a refreshing revelation as a TV analyst, providing the goods on players and the game by speaking a language understood by viewers, who were left informed and entertained. Now: That \u201caudition\u201d landed him the coaching job with the Pelicans, and his hiring was applauded in most circles. However, the Pelicans are four games under .500 despite Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. If they keep failing to gain traction in the competitive West, it\u2019ll be back to the Draft lottery for New Orleans. Then: The troublesome signs prior to the restart came to fruition in the bubble, where Horford and Joel Embiid were oil and water in the front court for the Philadelphia 76ers. Horford absorbed most of the blame after an abysmal playoff performance in which he averaged 7 ppg while the Sixers were swept in the first round. Now: Horford was shipped off to OKC in the offseason in a Sixers shakeup and there was much jubilation in Philly. There\u2019s a lot less pressure, noise and expectations in the heartland, where Horford is riding out his sunset by assuming a mentoring role with a young team that\u2019s years away from contending. Then: It was a disappearance nobody saw coming, because Siakam was impressive before the season was interrupted, then shaky when it resumed. He shot sub-40% overall and sub-20% on 3s in the playoffs and was Exhibit A for why the Raptors faltered. Now: Siakam is a mixed bag. He served a one-game benching for disciplinary reasons and was somewhat sluggish out of the gate. But lately, he\u2019s found a groove and is averaging 22 ppg and 7.1 rpg in February. He\u2019s leading the Raptors in scoring, but everyone knows Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry are the heart and soul of Toronto. Then: The surprise player in the bubble, Warren had a 53-point game and averaged nearly 27 points. A consistent scorer throughout his career but known more for his meltdown against Butler, Warren commanded double teams and lots of media attention in the bubble. Now: He had surgery to correct a stress fracture in his left foot in late December and isn\u2019t expected to recover until right before the playoffs, if at all, this season. The good news: He had a similar injury in 2016 and returned forcefully from that. Then: Helped by new coach Monty Williams, the Suns ran the table in the abbreviated regular season and nearly grabbed a play-in spot. Devin Booker took another star turn by sinking a dramatic shot to beat the Clippers. Now: They\u2019re no longer sweeping the floor of the West, for a change. Plenty of credit must go to Chris Paul, who arrived and fortified the club with leadership and providing backcourt balance with Booker. Also, Deandre Ayton is feeling his potential. Then: Hill became one of the main voices of the movement adopted by players and coaches, who collectively spoke out against injustice while locked inside the bubble. It was Hill who helped organize the Bucks\u2019 protest and prepared a statement to the media. Now: Hill was essentially dumped for Jrue Holiday in a multi-team trade that jettisoned Hill to OKC. A thumb injury is costing him an estimated month of action, and with OKC on a youth wave, there\u2019s the chance he could be on the move again before the trade deadline. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Rick Carlisle invoked the greats and decades of experience to explain the requisite mindset for conjuring the magic Luka Doncic cast upon the Boston Celtics on Tuesday in a 110-107 thriller . \u201cThe wiring of people like Luka Doncic, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, guys that have this laser-like focus in these situations, it\u2019s difficult to explain how their mind[s] work,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve seen over the years \u2014 and this is over three decades now \u2014 as the game gets tighter and the moment gets bigger, their focus is only on one thing, and that is succeeding with whatever the team needs; whether it\u2019s the perfect pass for the assist, whether it\u2019s great shot making. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this time and time again and been victimized as a coach when guys like Kobe have hit shots. He\u2019s a very rare breed of player. Not only does he have the laser-like focus, but he has the desire and all the tools to deliver.\u201d Doncic made that painfully clear to Boston over the last 15.8 seconds of the contest, as the 21-year-old capped his late heroics by nailing the game-winner with 0.1 ticks remaining. Surprisingly, Doncic\u2019s game-winner marked his second go-ahead 3-pointer of the night in the final minute. It came after Boston had just sliced through an 11-point deficit to seize a 105-104 lead with just 37.6 seconds remaining. Doncic just as quickly erased it all in front of the 3,300 fans at American Airlines Center to send the Mavericks (15-15) back to .500 for the first time since Jan. 22. The Mavericks' star talks with Inside the NBA after his game-winning shot vs. Boston. \u201cRight after the game, I said, \u2018Imagine if the whole crowd was there,'\u201d Doncic said. \u201cIt would be an even better feeling. But today, there were a couple of fans, and [I] thank everybody for coming. It feels better having a couple of fans.\u201d After dribbling around extensively in what appeared to be a frantic possession, Doncic nailed the first long-range ball with 15.8 seconds remaining over the outstretched arms of Daniel Theis. \u201cHonestly, I was more confident in the first one. It felt good out of my hands,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI was kind of tired just running around the whole possession. It got in, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Jaylen Brown would tie the game at 107 with 9.5 seconds left on a driving layup. On Dallas\u2019 next trip down the floor, Doncic knocked down the game winner with Kemba Walker and Aaron Nesmith contesting. \u201cThe two shots that Luka hit down the stretch in the last minute were just phenomenal shots,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBoth possessions were difficult. The first one was probably even more difficult than the second one because we were up against the clock, they had gone to a switching lineup, and he just hit just a tremendous one-on-one shot. The second one, we knew we had no timeouts. \u201cWe knew we were getting the ball to him to let him create, and that stepback was right in front of me. When that thing went up in the air, it was right on line, and it was an amazing shot. Breathtaking stuff from Luka.\u201d With Kristaps Porzingis missing his second straight game due to lower back tightness, Doncic finished with a game-high 31 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, while Brown and Jayson Tatum produced 29 and 28 points, respectively. Just five days away from his 22 nd birthday, Doncic has already connected on 11-of-29 attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime over the last three seasons. Doncic went 6-for-11 in those situations in 2018-19, 3-for-13 last season and 2-for-5 through the first 30 games of 2020-21. Doncic entered the game Tuesday 0-for-3 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of regulation or OT. He\u2019s 39% in those situations over the last three seasons, while the league average is 35%. This 21 year-old is DIFFERENT \ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84 pic.twitter.com\/pSuY744zvA \u2014 Dallas Mavericks (@dallasmavs) February 24, 2021 The victory over Boston marked Doncic\u2019s second career game-winning shot, and his first during the regular season. Remember, last season in the opening round of the playoffs, Doncic hit a buzzer-beater in OT during Game 4 against the LA Clippers in the NBA bubble. \u201cThat was nuts,\u201d said Jalen Brunson, who scored 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter to lead a Dallas bench that outscored Boston\u2019s reserves 51-19. \u201cJust watching [Doncic], he\u2019s obviously very good to say the least. He\u2019s bringing us together and we\u2019re on the right track now. We\u2019ve just got to keep it going. We\u2019ve got to keep playing for each other and have a short-term [memory] because we have a big opponent coming up next.\u201d By defeating the Celtics, the Mavericks have now won six of their last seven games headed into a three-game road trip out East, which starts Thursday at the Philadelphia 76ers, and concludes on March 1 against the Orlando Magic. Dallas guard Josh Richardson thinks the performance against Boston might serve the Mavericks well in the postseason. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how much playoff experience a lot of these guys on this team have, but I\u2019ve been in a few series a few different years. I know that most of those games come down to shots like that. So, I think for us to go through something like we did today, where we had a little lead in the fourth, they fought back and we just had to figure out a way to grind a win out is gonna come back on the tail end and be good for us.\u201d As for Doncic, as good as Tuesday night felt, he shrugged it off as business as usual. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cSometimes, two people go at me, [and] I have to pass it. Sometimes, you\u2019re gonna miss it like the last game against Portland. Sometimes, you\u2019re gonna make it.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Finally, it\u2019s Dame Time: Damian Lillard got bumped from the All-Star starting lineup for the Western Conference by a technicality: Because Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic outpolled the Portland point guard in fan balloting, it didn\u2019t matter that Lillard fared better than Doncic with the players and the media panel who combined for the other 50% of the vote. The tiebreaker was the fans\u2019 choice, even though Doncic himself wasn\u2019t so sure about the outcome (\u201cMaybe Lillard deserved it more than me,\u201d the Mavericks star said). The coaches cleaned that up. Beyond Lillard\u2019s overall production \u2014 29.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.9 apg, 62.0 true shooting percentage \u2014 there was no way those West bench bosses could ignore Lillard\u2019s four consecutive games starting on Valentine\u2019s Day of at least 30 points, 10 assists and five 3-pointers. He also ranks second in the NBA in clutch points (82), shooting 61.5% and leading Portland to a 12-4 mark in such situations (when the score is within five points in the final five minutes). 2. Winning matters. Mostly. Whether trying to deliver a lesson to their players or simply to grab at a handy crutch in cutting down the field of reserve candidates, coaches historically have favored players from winning teams on their ballots. Well, the picks were less pedantic this time around. Out West, only one of the All-Star Reserves comes from a team with a losing record as of the announcement Tuesday night: Zion Williamson of the 13-17 Pelicans. But in the East, sub-.500 records by the Knicks, Bulls and Magic didn\u2019t stop Julius Randle, Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic from earning the coaches\u2019 votes. All three are having terrific seasons individually, playing well enough that their respective teams would be several games further down in the standings without them. Factoring in Doncic and Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal, that means six of the 24 All-Star selections come from losing teams. Which seems OK on three fronts: First, 16 of the league\u2019s 30 teams went into Tuesday\u2019s slate of games with sub-.500 records. Then there\u2019s Boston, which at 15-15 landed both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the East bench. Imagine walling off more than half the talent pool from All-Star consideration. Second, this is primarily an entertainment event, unlike other NBA competition. Arbitrarily applying a W-L filter to an All-Star Game is as silly as, say, determining home park advantage in the World Series. And third, as noted last week in the starters takeaways piece, coaches should want productive players to stick around and do the heavy lifting of improving their teams. What, they should just congregate on a few winners in desirable markets as a way not just to chase rings but earn All-Star attention? 3. You\u2019ve got next, commish. It was fine that the coaches voted Lakers big man Anthony Davis to his eighth All-Star berth. That\u2019s a resume thing for a future Hall of Famer. But it\u2019s also fine that Davis almost certainly will require an injury replacement, due to the tendonosis in his right Achilles. Davis already has missed four straight and six of the past eight games, and the prognosis has been for him to be out through the All-Star break. No reason for him to rush back for the exhibition. That puts NBA commissioner Adam Silver on the clock to name a replacement on the West squad. Who gets the nod? Silver doesn\u2019t have to go with another big because the West, with Davis, has seven frontcourt players to five guards (the East is six and six). So two logical candidates would be Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker and Utah\u2019s Mike Conley. Booker ranked higher than his Suns teammate Chris Paul in the All-Star balloting. He finished fifth with the fans, fourth with the players and T-fifth with the media, compared to Paul\u2019s seventh, seventh and T-fifth. He leads Phoenix in scoring (24.7 ppg) while shooting 50.1 percent. It\u2019s curious that Booker \u2013 in the five seasons he\u2019s been an elite scorer \u2013 has never been tabbed by the coaches to be an All-Star reserve. He made it in 2020 in replacement of Lillard. Conley, in his 14 th season, might be the sentimental favorite, given his unofficial status as \u201cbest active player never to be an All-Star.\u201d He is at the controls of the NBA\u2019s most successful team with numbers, at 33, at or better than his career averages. But with Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell already among West All-Star Reserves, Conley would represent a third Jazz representative. That\u2019s a lot, especially without a starter. 4. Enough talent for a third team. Almost, anyway. \u201cSnubbed\u201d is a lousy way to describe players who didn\u2019t quite make the cut of the top 24. So we\u2019ll go with \u201cuninvited\u201d and still round up a pretty impressive group, any of whom would look perfectly joining the All-Stars in Atlanta in a couple weeks. Besides Booker and Conley, backcourt choices for the Outside-Looking-In squad would include: Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young, San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan and Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton. The frontcourt: Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis, Detroit\u2019s Jerami Grant, Philadelphia\u2019s Tobias Harris, Charlotte\u2019s Gordon Hayward, New Orleans\u2019 Brandon Ingram, and Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler. On the bubble for this mythical roster, it says here, would be Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray and Oklahoma City\u2019s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. 5. Some notable firsts and All-Star leftovers. Four of the 14 players named as reserves will be making their first appearances in an All-Star Game: Brown, LaVine, Randle and Williamson. Several other players might have made strong bids to reach this status \u2014 Portland\u2019s C.J. McCollum, Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant, Houston\u2019s Christian Wood \u2014 for the first time if not for significant injuries. Washington\u2019s Russell Westbrook most likely will have his personal streak of six consecutive All-Star appearances snapped. Westbrook, a nine-time All-Star, and Derrick Rose, a three-timer, are the only active NBA Most Valuable Player winners to not make this year\u2019s All-Star Game. Remember how the Lakers drafted Randle, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Ingram as lottery picks in consecutive Drafts from 2014 through 2016? All three were deemed expendable for one reason or another, with Russell\u2019s immaturity getting him traded in 2017 and Randle and Ingram moving on as Los Angeles reconfigured around LeBron James. Well, with Randle\u2019s selection this year, all three became All-Stars for teams other than L.A. And finally, time marches on: Williamson becomes the first NBA All-Star born in the 2000s, 20 months after becoming the league\u2019s first No. 1 draft pick born in this millennium. The first NBA All-Star born in the 1990s? Kyrie Irving, who was a month shy of his 21 st birthday when he played in the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In nine games in January he averaged 18.6 ppg on 44.9% shooting from the field and 28.6% on 3-pointers.

In 13 games prior to McCollum being out, Lillard\u2019s usage was at 28.8% ; in the 16 games since McCollum went out, Lillard\u2019s usage has increased to 33.9% . \u2022 The Nuggets have shot at least 51% from the field and 44% from 3-point range in each of their past three games . Only three teams have ever put together at least a four-game streak of such shooting efficiency; the last team do it was the 2017-18 Utah Jazz (Jan. 30 \u2013 Feb. 4, 2018). The Blazers had a four-game streak in 1987, while the longest streak belongs to the Indiana Pacers with five in a row (April 13-20, 1994). \u2022 The Blazers (31.7 ppg) and Nuggets (31.4 ppg) rank first and second, respectively in first-quarter scoring , with the Nuggets taking an average lead of 3.9 points (highest in NBA) into the second quarter. \u2022 Nikola Jokic continues posting career-best numbers in nearly every category this season \u2014 26.6 ppg ( 10th ), 11.1 rpg ( 11th ), 8.5 apg ( 5th ) and 1.7 spg ( 4th ).

Darius Garland (PG \u2013 CLE) : $5,900 vs. ATL Garland scored a season-best 43.6 FD points Sunday against the Thunder. and he\u2019s logged at least 35 minutes in each of his last three games. The upside is huge for Garland, especially in a favorable matchup with Atlanta\u2019s defense and a 228.5 over\/under. DeAndre Jordan (C \u2013 BKN) : $5,500 vs. SAC Jordan is coming off a monster 47.2 FD-point performance (his highest total of the season) Sunday, and he finds himself in an excellent spot against the Kings this evening. Jordan is not someone to play in cash lineups, but the upside is huge for tournaments. If Jeff Green (shoulder) is out tonight, Jordan becomes a near-lock, so check Green\u2019s status closer to tip-off. Joe Harris (SF \u2013 BKN) : $5,300 vs. SAC Harris hasn\u2019t been hot of late, but he\u2019s remained a permanent fixture in Brooklyn\u2019s starting lineup and played more than 30 minutes in each of his last three games. The sharpshooter is always worth a look in tournaments because of his big scoring upside. For just $5.3K, I love a guy who\u2019s likely to play heavy minutes in a game with a 242 over\/under. Nerlens Noel (PF \u2013 NYK) : $5,300 vs. GSW This is a pace-up spot for Noel, who will face a generous Warriors frontcourt defense tonight. Despite a low 216 over\/under, Noel is a great value here, as most of his value comes from rebounds and blocks rather than scoring. The lack of scoring caps his upside, but he\u2019s got a solid floor and has seen his minutes rise to the high-20\u2019s recently. Saben Lee (PG \u2013 DET) : $5,000 at ORL Lee provided 32.3 FD points across 32 minutes off the bench Monday, so we\u2019re going to look to him again tonight. Dennis Smith Jr. got the nod in the starting lineup with Delon Wright out, but it was Lee who shouldered the load at point guard, while DSJ saw just 15 minutes of action. There\u2019s clear risk in this pick, but if the talented rookie can stick in the rotation, he should be a DFS value until Wright returns. DaQuan Jeffries (SF \u2013 SAC) : $4,700 at BKN Jeffries went for 34.2 FD points across 39 minutes Sunday, making his first start with Harrison Barnes out of action. Barnes is still questionable tonight, and if he remains out, Jeffries is worth a dart throw in tournaments. Luke Walton\u2018s recent lineups have been head-scratching, so Jeffries could have his minutes slashed in the blink of an eye, but at just $4.7K in a fantastic matchup, he\u2019s worth a look. Jordan McLaughlin (PG \u2013 MIN) : $4,300 at MIL McLaughlin has seen his production and minutes tick up over the last two weeks, and with D\u2019Angelo Russell out for the foreseeable future, McLaughlin should continue to play a key role in Minnesota\u2019s rotation. He\u2019s gone for at least 20 FD points in six straight, so the floor is relatively safe for him to hit 5x value on the slate. Despite logging fewer than 20 minutes in three of those six games, McLaughlin is efficient with assists and steals, providing a significant boost in value. Zeke Nnaji (PF \u2013 DEN) : $3,800 vs. POR Nnaji started and logged 29 minutes Sunday against Atlanta, but his performance was underwhelming to say the least. Still, Portland is dead-last in PF defense this season, so you couldn\u2019t ask for a better matchup. I\u2019m certainly not looking for Nnaji in cash games, but I\u2019ll take a few shots in tournament lineups due to his low cost, great matchup, and minutes."},{"id":499734,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-ben-simmons-maintain-leads","date":"2021-02-23","title":"Defensive Player Ladder: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons maintain leads","content":"As we grapple here week to week to identify, evaluate and rank players who might wind up as top candidates for the NBA\u2019s 2021 Kia Defensive Player of the Year award, we are reminded of how broad and frankly nebulous such competitions are. Not all of the awards, mind you. The Kia NBA Sixth Man Award is about as straightforward as it gets: it goes to a great \u201cinstant offense\u201d player off the bench, period. The last time it went to somebody who injected rebounding or defense in reserve was, well, never. The DPOY is trickier. It lumps in the league\u2019s best rim protectors with great on-ball defenders. Big men who block shots and snag rebounds with sneaky, quick wings snagging steals in passing lanes or drawing charges. Apples vs. oranges. Winners of the DPOY may reflect on NBA values that have shifted. Seven of the first nine winners from 1983-91 were guards or small forwards. But only five of the 29 recipients since then have been. And three of the last 16, including Kawhi Leonard\u2019s back-to-back wins in 2015 and 2016 and Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2020. One-on-one \u201cstoppers\u201d get lip service and votes, but guys such as Rudy Gobert, Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol, Tyson Chandler and Dwight Howard \u2014 who have won eight of the past 12 \u2014 take home the hardware. Are the bigs really more deserving? The Ladder put the question to a sampling of NBA coaches, asking which they would rather have: Great perimeter defense or great big-man defense? Washington\u2019s Scott Brooks: \u201cIf you want to be great, you need \u2018em both. But if you had to pick one, I think rim protection is so important. I know everybody\u2019s shooting 3s, but 60 points a game are at the rim. If you can take away six or eight of those every game, you have a chance.\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s Mike Budenholzer: \u201cYou need to have both. Wings that can guard. Big guys who can protect the paint and scramble and guard. It\u2019s such a tough league \u2014 there\u2019s so much offense out there now. \u2026 You really need five that can do it all.\u201d Now that\u2019s just greedy. Sacramento\u2019s Luke Walton: \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d take either one.\u201d No, that wasn\u2019t a cry for help based on the Kings\u2019 No. 30 spot in defensive rating (118.0 points per 100 possessions). Walton was just revving up. \u201cYou have to be able to defend the perimeter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then with the amount of spacing almost every team is playing with, with the 3-point shot so relevant now, if you have to get into full rotations, which is what NBA basketball has done forever, there\u2019s so much shooting out there, you\u2019re always chasing. \u201cSo if you can get a [Rudy] Gobert, someone like that who can protect your rim and you can leave the other guys at home on the shooters, I think everyone sees how valuable that is.\u201d Statistically, some numbers \u2014 those attempting to assess rim protection or pick-and-roll defense on roll men \u2014 seem most suited to the defensive contributions of big men. Others \u2014 like deflections\/loose balls recovered or pick-and-roll defense on ball handers \u2014 identify a lot of wing defenders. Then there are the everyone-into-the-pool stats such as defensive win shares or on court\/off court that try to account for defense all over the floor. Apples vs. oranges? Better throw some bananas, cherries and mangoes in there. Eye tests add grapes, lots of them. So that\u2019s the fruit salad the Ladder has to deal with each week. Hey, it\u2019s a tough job but someone has to eat it. Here are this week\u2019s Top 5 on the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Feb. 22) Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Gobert remains the favorite for DPOY \u2014 with lots of season left, mind you \u2014 because his work at that end of the floor remains central (fitting, given his position) to what the Jazz are doing. He has help, notably wing Royce O\u2019Neale and point guard Mike Conley, whose on\/off defensive rating is a team best minus-11.2, better even than Gobert\u2019s minus-7.6. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 We\u2019re sticking with Simmons in the runner-up spot at least until we learn if his defense (along with the rest of his game) gets respected enough by the Eastern Conference coaches to earn All-Star reserve status. He leads the league in deflections (3.9) and loose balls recovered (1.5) per game. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 One way to avoid running into Turner on a drive to the rim? Shut down the Pacers for two postponed games. The big man still leads the NBA in blocked shots (3.5) per game and Indiana ranks second in blocks per game (6.2). Last week\u2019s ranking: N\/A Anthony Davis, in this spot last week, has missed the past four games and the team\u2019s defense has sagged, contributing to a 1-3 record. But the Lakers lead the NBA in defensive rating (105.5) and James, already carrying such a load offensively, also leads the league in defensive win shares (0.179), topping both Conley (0.177) and Gobert (0.159). As for Davis, being out gets him a seat in the Ladder\u2019s crowded green room of Top 5 candidates. Last week\u2019s ranking: N\/A The third-year Suns wing regularly draws the opponents\u2019 most prolific scorer as his defensive assignment. He has dealt with pick-and-roll ball handlers a league-high 219 times, limiting them to 0.91 points per possession and a scoring frequency of 42 percent. His net rating of 5.7 actually splits to 11.6 at home \u2026 and minus-0.9 on the road. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Rockets announced that they are releasing Cousins after 25 games with the team. The former four-time All-Star center averaged 9.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, 2.4 assists and shot 37.6% overall with Houston, which signed him as a free agent in late November. Shams Charania of The Athletic was first to report the news. The decision to move on from Cousins was not a shocking one for Houston, as reports of he and the team planning to part ways surfaced over the weekend . The Rockets have struggled this season, starting off 3-6 as talk of trading former Kia MVP and Houston star James Harden hovered over the team. Since Harden was dealt to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 13, the Rockets have gone 8-12 and are in the midst of an eight-game losing streak. Cousins had a smattering of good games with Houston this season, including a 28-point, 17-rebound, five-assist performance on Jan. 23 vs. Dallas. That game was a throwback to his heyday as an All-Star with the Sacramento Kings and New Orleans Pelicans. Per Charania, the Rockets are making the move to release Cousins so he can have time to find a team on the open market. Houston guaranteed Cousins\u2019 $2.3 million salary last week and has nothing but positives to say about his approach to the season, Charania reports. Houston has several youngsters in the frontcourt \u2014 including Christian Wood, Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Danuel House \u2014 it is looking to give more of an opportunity to and moving on from Cousins helps facilitate that notion."},{"id":499468,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gordon-hayward-exits-game-after-re-aggravating-right-hand-injury","date":"2021-02-23","title":"Gordon Hayward exits game after re-aggravating right hand injury","content":"Charlotte\u2019s 132-110 loss to Utah on Monday night included an injury to one of its most important players.

Given all that, basketball seems secondary to the Spurs right now. But they were back to work Monday, holding a full-fledged practice for the first time since it was revealed last week that at least four players tested positive for COVID-19. They will be without at least six players when they return to the court Wednesday at Oklahoma City. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the philosophy that there are all these people, or groups of people, who have it worse than you do,\u201d Popovich said, wearing a cap bearing the logo of the San Antonio Food Bank. \u201cAnd considering our positions in this world, we are very, very well off.\u201d The Spurs said five players \u2014 Rudy Gay, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Quinndary Weatherspoon and Derrick White \u2014 are away from the team because of health and safety protocols and will not travel with the club to Oklahoma City. Popovich indicated that not all of them have been able to return to San Antonio yet because of NBA rules; the outbreak hit with the Spurs on a road trip last week. DeMar DeRozan is also out for Wednesday\u2019s game for personal reasons; he revealed late last week that his father died. \u201cWhen you lose a parent, it\u2019s a difficult situation,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been in touch with him and he\u2019s very mature, kind man and he\u2019s doing what he needs to do with his family right now.\u201d When a player is listed as out because of the protocols, that typically means he has tested positive for COVID-19, has a suspected positive test or is out for reasons related to contact tracing. And before any player who has been positive is cleared to return, he first needs to clear several medical exams \u2014 which means it\u2019s unclear when any of the five players out for virus-related reasons may return. There may be one encouraging piece of roster news: LaMarcus Aldridge, who hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 1 because of right hip flexor soreness, may be ready to return. The Spurs plan on making that final determination on Tuesday. Popovich said Aldridge came through Monday\u2019s practice fine. \u201cI\u2019m sure he was probably a little winded,\u201d Popovich said. The NBA initially said last week that four Spurs players had tested positive for COVID-19, without identifying any by name. They last played Feb. 14, beating Charlotte for their fifth win in six games and improving to 16-11 \u2014 five games over the .500 mark for the first time since April 2019. The news of the four positive tests hit the team not long afterward. Road games against Detroit, Cleveland, New York and Indiana were all postponed, as were a pair of Hornets games in an abundance of caution while contact tracing studies could be completed. Those postponements lifted the number of games called off for virus-related reasons this season to 29, not including a handful of other games that were rearranged to fill some gaps in the schedule. The Spurs are the fourth team to have an unplanned break of at least a week this season because of virus-related issues. Boston went seven days between games, Memphis went 12 days and Washington went 13 days. Then came the storm, which basically crippled much of Texas for days. Popovich preaches perspective, and tried Monday to put missing a few basketball games in its proper place. \u201cComplaining, or feeling sorry for oneself, that\u2019s not in the picture,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. Not deserved. Only thank yous for what we all have. So, you know, at this time, you just think about all the people that have gone through hell.

Note : All stats and records through games played on Sunday, Feb. 21 Feb. 22 Trail Blazers (18-11) at Suns (19-10) 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass It\u2019s a battle between two of the most clutch players in the game \u2013 Damian Lillard ranks second in the league with 82 clutch points (on 61.5% shooting from the field, 58.8% on 3-pointers and 100% on free throws), and Chris Paul ranks fifth with 63 clutch points this season and let the entire league last season with 150 clutch points. The Suns and Blazers enter the week ranked fourth and fifth in the Western Conference; could this game turn out to be a first-round playoff preview? This is the first meeting of the season between the Suns and Blazers; they split last year\u2019s seasons series with the four games separated by just one point.  Feb. 23 Kings (12-18) at Nets (20-12) 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Nets enter Week 10 riding a six-game win streak \u2013 the longest active streak in the league, as they just swept the Pacific Division in five straight road games. One of those wins came in Sacramento as Kyrie Irving (40 points, nine 3-pointers made) and the Nets set a franchise record with 27 3-pointers on 47 attempts (57.4%). The Nets became the fifth team to ever shoot 57% or better when attempting at least 40 3-pointers in a game. While the Nets are the hottest team in the league at the moment, the Kings are looking to get back on track as they have lost seven straight games. Prior to this losing streak, the Kings had won seven of eight games; is it time for the pendulum to swing back in the wins direction? Warriors (16-15) at Knicks (15-16) 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Stephen Curry at The Garden \u2013 need I say more. Just a reminder that Curry posted the first 50-point game of his career at Madison Square Garden against the Knicks back in 2013. That 54-point performance remained his career high until this season as he has topped that mark twice already. The Knicks are currently seventh in the Eastern Conference with Julius Randle making a strong push for All-Star consideration from the league\u2019s coaches. He is one of four players averaging at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five assists this season.  Feb. 24 Raptors (16-15) at Heat (13-17) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The last two teams to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals meet for the third time this season after splitting their first two meetings on Jan. 20 and 22 in Toronto. The Heat are back at full strength and coming off a 96-94 win over the Lakers in a Finals rematch. Since returning to the Heat on Jan. 30, Jimmy Butler has averaged 21.1 points, 9.0 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 1.8 steals over the past 12 games . Pascal Siakam is one of four other players besides Butler to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.5 steals over the past dozen games. Timberwolves (7-24) at Bulls (13-16) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Anthony Edwards just had the dunk of the year on Friday night against the Raptors. Now the rookie will face another high-flier in Zach LaVine \u2013 the two-time winner of the Slam Dunk contest at NBA All-Star 2015 and 2016. ANTHONY. EDWARDS. pic.twitter.com\/AduIP1LKup \u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 20, 2021 Speaking of All-Star, LaVine is looking to earn his first selection with the announcement of the reserves on Tuesday. LaVine is averaging career highs across the board (28.9 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 5.1 apg) and enters Week 10 ranked sixth in the league in scoring average and first in clutch scoring (85 total points in 74 minutes).  Feb. 26 Hornets (14-15) at Warriors (16-15) 10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Hornets defeated the Warriors in a wild finish on Saturday night, with Terry Rozier hitting an off-balance jumper from the left corner as time expired to give the Hornets a 102-100 win. It was Terry\u2019s fourth-straight 30-point game \u2013 the longest streak in his career and tied with Zach LaVine and Damian Lillard for the longest active streak in the league. Stephen Curry missed the game due to illness, but coach Steve Kerr is hopeful he\u2019ll be able to return Tuesday so he most likely will be available for this game on Friday. Seeing Curry square of with rookie sensation LaMelo Ball should be entertaining in its own right.  Feb. 27 Jazz (24-6) at Magic (13-18) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Utah saw its nine-game win streak snapped on Friday against the Clippers, but the Jazz still enter Week 10 with the best record in the league and a must-watch when they pop up on League Pass. Rudy Gobert (14.0 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 2.7 bpg) ranks second in the league in both rebounding and blocks and is likely headed to his second straight All-Star Game. The same can be said for Donovan Mitchell, who is averaging a team-high and career-high 24.6 ppg and dishing out 5.1 apg as well. They will face an Orlando squad that enters Week 10 having won three straight and four of its last five games . The Magic have an All-Star candidate of their own in Nikola Vucevic (24.1 ppg, 11.7 rpg); how will he fare when matched up with Gobert? In their two meetings last season, Gobert held Vucevic to 23 total points on 8-25 (32%) shooting in 14:32 of matchup time."},{"id":499245,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/with-7-internationals-wizards-reflect-nbas-global-reach","date":"2021-02-22","title":"With 7 internationals, Wizards reflect NBA's global reach","content":"You can\u2019t spell international without intentional , but the way the Washington Wizards see it, their United Nations roster has nothing to do with any grand design. It is, instead, just a happy by-product of a sport and a league that have stamped an imprint around the globe. Washington has spent much of 2020-21 near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, but leads the league in two categories: committing fouls and, with seven, the number of foreign-born players on its roster. It\u2019s unlikely those two categories are related, but you can bet the Wizards\u2019 basketball operations peeps are more focused on the former than the latter. It\u2019s basketball. Without borders, y\u2019know? \u201cIf these guys can play, I don\u2019t care where they\u2019re from,\u201d general manager Tommy Sheppard told NBA.com last week. \u201cI never check passports. If you can play, you can stay.\u201d The Wizards team that will try to extend its winning streak to five Monday night against the Lakers at Staples Center ( NBA TV, 10 p.m. ET ) has seven players from six different countries. They are: Rui Hachimura (Japan), Deni Avdija (Israel), Raul Neto (Brazil), Alex Len (Ukraine), Davis Bertans (Latvia) and Moritz Wagner and Isaac Bonga (both from Germany). Center Anzejs Pasecniks, also of Latvia, was waived in January, but the roll call bumped back to seven when Len was signed six days later. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it as \u2018this guy\u2019s from Israel, this guy\u2019s from Japan, this guy\u2019s from Germany,\u2019\u201d coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cWe all speak the same language and we all want the same thing. That\u2019s basketball. Even the terminology now, everyone\u2019s talking the same.\u201d The math of all this isn\u2019t surprising. As of opening night in December, there were 107 international players from 41 countries on NBA rosters. There were another 10 on two-way contracts to split time between the NBA and the G League. Heck, as long as we\u2019re counting, there were six such players among the 15 who were honored on an All-NBA first, second or third team last season. This is the seventh consecutive season begun with at least 100 foreign-born players \u2014 nearly 25 percent of the playing workforce \u2014 and all 30 teams had at least one representative, according to league data. So if there were an even distribution, each team would have 3.56 international guys. That the Wizards have doubled that number, though, isn\u2019t entirely happenstance. Credit Sheppard and his long-established interest in and familiarity with basketball in foreign lands. While Dallas president of basketball operations Donn Nelson is widely considered one of the early cultivators of overseas talent among active executives, the Wizards\u2019 GM wasn\u2019t far behind. Washington has had some notable foreign players in its past \u2014 Manute Bol (Sudan), Gheorghe Muresan (Romania), Andrew Gaze (Australia) \u2014 but Sheppard\u2019s arrival in 2003 brought a spark that has taken the global focus to another level. \u201cWe try to find talent anywhere we can,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cI do believe there\u2019s so much talent around the world you can tap into.\u201d Sheppard\u2019s international connections date back as far as 1996, when he worked with the Denver Nuggets in player relations. He was assisting with the Summer Olympics that year when veteran Euro player Sarunas Marciulionis was traded to the Nuggets, and the two struck up a friendship right there in Atlanta. Over time, they became business partners, founding the North European Basketball League that ran from 1998 through 2003. Sheppard worked three Olympics for the USOC. He picked longtime NBA coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s brain in their time together in Denver \u2014 D\u2019Antoni was a legend as an American playing and coaching in Italy in the 1980s and 90s. And the Wizards GM routinely accompanied his teams\u2019 international players \u2014 Marcin Gortat, Nene \u2014 when they competed in global events. That introduced him to more prospects, like current Washington players Bertans and Neto. \u201cI\u2019ve always taken great inspiration from what the Spurs did forever,\u201d Sheppard said, citing the franchise famous for Manu Ginobili (Argentina), Tony Parker (France) and even Tim Duncan (Virgin Islands) as successful overseas stars. \u201cThey were the gold standard. It\u2019s not like they said, \u2018Let\u2019s go get international guys.\u2019 It kind of organically grew that way. You take a lot of notes over the years and you see what works in different places.\u201d Sheppard estimates he has worked with 25-30 international players in his career. \u201cEach one has a different story, but you learn from every one,\u201d he said. He has found many to be well-equipped to handle the challenges and uncertainties of NBA life, from losing streaks to the current COVID shutdown and postponements. \u201cI think it\u2019s [having] a global perspective,\u201d the Wizards exec said. \u201cLife in the NBA sometimes is, \u2018The Lamborghini had a flat tire today,\u2019 that\u2019s a crisis in our world. That\u2019s not the world\u2019s perspective. There are ways when you\u2019re from other countries and you scratch and claw to get to the NBA on a journey that\u2019s a little different that help you.\u201d When Sheppard took over as GM two summers ago, he and owner Ted Leonsis created a pro personnel department that was overdue within the organization. They beefed up staffing, looking now to Johnny Rogers to head up that area \u2014 Rogers was a second-round pick by Sacramento in 1986 out of Stanford who spent most of his 18-year playing career in Europe. The scouting department includes Marco Baldi in Treviso, Italy; Jon Pastuszek in France, and Francesco Cavalli in Milan. \u201cGetting real-time information from around the world lets you make the most informed decisions you can make,\u201d said Sheppard, who soon plans to hire an international assistant coach. Hachimura, of course, was seen by everyone domestically in his three seasons at Gonzaga. Others such as Wagner and Len also played in the NCAA. As for Avdija, Sheppard said, he dropped into their laps as the No. 9 pick in the 2020 Draft, with the Wizards claiming to have him as the fourth-best prospect on their board. Those two most recent lottery picks weren\u2019t important only to Washington\u2019s basketball operation. They turned on the lights of international opportunity for the franchise\u2019s business folks. \u201cAfter we drafted Rui, we had over 100 Japanese media members who attended his first press conference in D.C.,\u201d said Jim Van Stone, president of business operations and chief commercial officer for Monumental Sports, the Wizards\u2019 parent company. \u201cRight then and there, it said to us, as we move forward with international players, we need to create international-language content platforms around those players.\u201d Done. The Wizards\u2019 Web site is accessible in English, Japanese and Hebrew now. The team has Twitter and Instagram accounts in all three languages, too. They have hired staff to handle the additional work, well worth it given the business relationships with sponsors and partners in Japan, India, China and the Middle East. \u201cWe really want to make the fans in Japan feel like the Washington Wizards are their hometown team,\u201d said Van Stone, who has made three trips to Japan since Hachimura came aboard. \u201cMake them feel really close to their favorite NBA players even if they\u2019re a 14-hour flight away.\u201d And he said the passion for Avdija, despite Israel\u2019s smaller population, has been just as avid. The players are aware of their far-reaching appeal and fan base. Said Bertans: \u201cJapan has a huge population and Rui is like the Michael Jordan of Japan. Everybody knows him, everybody follows him. The same with Deni \u2014 Israel is a huge basketball country and they love the game.\u201d The significance isn\u2019t lost on Wizards players either. Some of them have felt like pioneers. But they expect more hitting the NBA shores. \u201cFor the game to grow in any country, all it takes is one player,\u201d said Bertans, the 6-foot-10 \u201cstretch four\u201d forward. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we have more and more NBA players from different countries, not just the ones everybody got used to. Now we see countries where the population is ridiculously small, and they have an NBA player.\u201d Like Latvia. Bertans recited the history of the NBA in his native land. First there was Gundars Vetra, a guard who played 13 games for Minnesota in the early 90s. Then it was forward Andris Biedrins whose career ran from 2004 to 2014. \u201cNow we have three or four players playing at the same time in the NBA, which is ridiculous for our small country,\u201d he said. That currently includes Bertans, Dallas\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis and Houston forward Rodions Kurucs. Where the rubber meets the hardwood, on the court in competition in the best basketball league in the world, the Wizards claim no cultural or communication issues. Same with the locker room. Style of play is less of an issue than ever, for example. It used to be, international players were considered \u201csoft\u201d when thrown into the rigors of more physical NBA play of three or four decades ago. Remember how Toni Kukoc was dubbed \u201cBambi\u201d by some disparaging Chicago teammates? Dirk Nowitzki had critics wondering how well he would fare while getting bumped and bruised in ways that didn\u2019t typically happen overseas. But the NBA itself is a lot less physical now, with 3-point mania and the abolition of hand-checking on defense opening the door to a more finesse game. Also, NBA style has been embraced in so many other global markets. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve noticed, I\u2019d say over the past 15 years, is that [international influence] used to be great passing, great movement, everything like that,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUsed to be spot-up shooters, cutters, ball movers. But now you\u2019re seeing more 1-on-1 guys, ball handling, guys who are controlling the ball and making moves. Now it really is a worldly game.\u201d Several Wizards said they have no issues in language skills or cultural tastes in their multi-national locker room. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very fun, having a lot of people from different countries,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s more comfortable for me to play with these guys \u2014 international. Just to be around. I feel like it\u2019s just a different flavor.\u201d Then Hachimura wrapped up his Zoom media availability for English questions, and began a session in Japanese. Winning over American teammates used to be a process for foreign-born players, based on unfamiliarity. Not so much anymore. Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook and others seem almost as pleased with the roster makeup as the Wizards\u2019 marketing department. \u201cWe\u2019re all basketball players from different walks of life,\u201d Len said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the same goal when we get on the court \u2014 play together \u2014 and then we\u2019ve got good leadership, Russ, Bradley and Scott Brooks leading the way. Off the court, you don\u2019t even realize guys are from different countries. You just play basketball.\u201d Said Brooks: \u201cWhen I was a player, I saw that it took a while for new guys to gain the trust and respect of teammates. But now with social media, there are so many guys who have platforms and been exposed to it all, they look at it as, \u2018This is what we do now.\u2019 So that\u2019s really changed. \u201cBut it works both ways. Whether you\u2019re from California or Latvia, if you can\u2019t play, you\u2019re not going to blend in.\u201d Sheppard and Van Stone talked of the appeal of the District of Columbia for international players, with embassies from around the world and pockets of residents who come from the same places as those Wizards. There\u2019s a comfort factor in play in the other direction too, or will be over time. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the pandemic to get over with,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve got seven places in the world I can go visit and know the good restaurants and places to stay.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Timberwolves announced late Sunday evening that coach Ryan Saunders had been relieved of his duties following the team\u2019s 103-99 defeat to the New York Knicks. \u201cWe would like to thank Ryan for his time and commitment to the Timberwolves organization and wish him the best in the future,\u201d Timberwolves President of Basketball Operations Gersson Rosas said in a team statement. \u201cThese are difficult decisions to make, however this change is in the best interest of the organization\u2019s short and long-term goals.\u201d On Monday, the Timberwolves announced the hiring of Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch as their next coach. Finch has 24 years of coaching experience, roughly half of that in Europe. The two-time NCAA Division III All-American at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania played for the Sheffield Sharks in the British Basketball League and later coached the same team from 1997-2003. \u201cI am excited to announce Chris Finch as our next head coach,\u201d said Rosas. \u201cChris brings a wealth of basketball experience from his time in the NBA, G League and Internationally. He is one of the most creative basketball minds in the NBA, has success maximizing players, and I am excited to see him bring our team to the next level and beyond.\u201d Rosas and Finch worked together in Houston, where Finch was an assistant (2011-16) and Rosas was a basketball operations executive. Finch was a two-time NCAA Division III All-American at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania played for the Sheffield Sharks in the British Basketball League and later coached the same team from 1997-2003. Finch also coached Britain\u2019s national team in the 2012 Olympics. \u201cI would like to thank Glen Taylor and Gersson Rosas for this incredible opportunity to be the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves,\u201d said Finch. \u201cI look forward to working hand and hand with Gersson to build and lead a team that Timberwolves fans will be proud of. We have excellent pieces in place and I can\u2019t wait to get to work.\u201d Saunders, the 34-year-old son of the late Minnesota coach Flip Saunders, was with the Timberwolves for parts of three seasons, going 43-94. Minnesota has the league\u2019s worst record this season at 7-24 and is already 7 1\/2 games out of what would be the final play-in spot for the Western Conference postseason. Saunders officially took the reins in 2019 after an interim stint following the departure of Tom Thibodeau. This has been a wildly disappointing season for the Timberwolves, who started 2-0 and haven\u2019t had much to savor since. Karl-Anthony Towns, the team\u2019s best player, dislocated his left wrist in the season\u2019s second game and missed six games \u2014 then returned and missed 13 more after being diagnosed with COVID-19. D\u2019Angelo Russell, a former All-Star whom the Timberwolves acquired from Golden State via trade last season, is shooting a career-best 39.9% from 3-point range. Minnesota also boasts 2020 No. 1 overall pick Anthony Edwards, high-scoring swingman Malik Beasley and the sixth overall selection from 2019, Jarrett Culver. There was no sign that the Timberwolves had stopped playing for Saunders; they were down by 21 points in the third quarter at New York earlier Sunday, then took the lead in the final minutes before falling 103-99. \u201cUnfortunately we ran out of time,\u201d Saunders said after that loss. The 2020-21 campaign has been especially difficult for Towns. The 25-year-old, who lost his mother due to complications with COVID-19 last year, has played just 11 games this season due to a dislocated wrist and dealt with the virus himself. Towns, who made the All-Star team in 2018 and 2019 after being drafted No. 1 overall in 2015, is the longest-tenured player on the Timberwolves\u2019 roster. Russell, meanwhile, recently underwent ankle surgery and is expected to miss at least another three to five weeks. Ryan Saunders ranks seventh out of 13 on the all-time winning percentage list for the woebegone franchise, ahead of Bill Musselman, Randy Wittman, Bill Blair, Sidney Lowe, Kurt Rambis and Jimmy Rodgers.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. Saben Lee (PG \u2013 DET): 1% rostered Delon Wright will miss two weeks with a groin strain. On Sunday, Dennis Smith Jr. received the start but only played 15 minutes. As a result, Lee played 33 minutes off the bench and contributed 12 points, four rebounds, five assists and three steals. The coaching staff raved about him after the game, and there\u2019s a good chance he gets extended playing time while Wright is out. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SA): 44% rostered The Spurs only play two games this week because one game was postponed due to COVID-19 protocols, so streaming Poeltl isn\u2019t the ideal scenario. This is more of a longer-term play because LaMarcus Aldridge, who is dealing with a hip injury, still has no timetable to return. Plus, there have been plenty of trade rumors involving Aldridge. With that said, if Aldridge does return, Poeltl will likely go back to playing 20 minutes per game. However, he seems to be more in the Spurs\u2019 future plans than Aldridge. Over the last four games, Poeltl has been a top 20 player, averaging 28.6 minutes, 10 points, 10 rebounds, one steal and 3.3 blocks per game while shooting 70% overall and 66% from the line. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (SG \u2013 HOU): 27% rostered Over the last six games, Tate has been a top-60 player, averaging 32.1 minutes, 14.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 61% and 75% from the line. With DeMarcus Cousins no longer on the team and the Rockets embracing small-ball again, Tate\u2019s role looks to be secure. The Rockets also play four games this week with no back-to-backs. Jae Crowder (SF\/PF \u2013 PHO): 42% rostered Over the last six games, Crowder has been a top 50 player. He\u2019s no longer starting but still getting 27.3 minutes of playing time. He\u2019s been blistering hot by Crowder\u2019s standards (46%) so expect that to regress since he\u2019s at 39% for the season. He can provide some points, 3-pointers, rebounds and steals. Plus, he has four nice matchups (POR, CHA, CHI, MIN) with no back-to-backs this week. Dorian Finney-Smith (SF\/PF \u2013 DAL): 10% rostered The disrespect for Finney-Smith is a strange one because he\u2019s been a top-45 player over the last four games. The usage rate is low, but he provides a little something in every category. Over the last two games, he\u2019s provided 14 points and four 3-pointers in both and is playing 34.9 minutes per game. Garrett Temple (PG\/SG \u2013 CHI): 8% rostered Over the last seven games, Temple has been a top-70 player, starting five and averaging 32.9 minutes, 10.1 points, 1.3 three-pointers, 4.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists, one steal and one block while shooting 52% from the field. He\u2019s a low usage rate player (11.6), so the points will rarely be voluminous, but he chips in everywhere else. The Bulls play four games this week with no back-to-backs. T. J. McConnell (PG\/SG \u2013 IND): 39% rostered McConnell\u2019s roster percentage only went up 8% in the last week. People don\u2019t need assists and defensive stats? Over the last six games, he\u2019s averaged 30.1 minutes, 4.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.7 steals and one block while shooting 50% from the field. The Pacers play three games with a back-to-back on Friday\/Saturday. Saddiq Bey (SF \u2013 DET): 44% rostered With Blake Griffin shut down due to trade exploration, Bey has started the last three games and been a top-60 player for fantasy on a per-game basis. He\u2019s averaged 34.1 minutes, 14 points, three 3-pointers, 4.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.3 steals while shooting 46% from the field. The usage rate has been 15.7. He\u2019s shooting 41% from the field on the season, so expect some regression in that department, but he\u2019s going to play a ton of minutes and should be a decent source of 3-pointers and rebounds. Detroit plays four games this week with a back-to-back on Tuesday\/Wednesday. Derrick Jones Jr. (SG\/SF \u2013 POR): 12% rostered Need defensive stats? Then you\u2019ve come to the right place. Over the last four games, Jones Jr. has averaged 0.8 steals and 1.8 blocks. He\u2019s also chipped in 6.8 rebounds with 10.8 points and one 3-pointer. He\u2019s shooting 53% on 7.5 shot attempts. On the season, the field goal percentage is 47%, while the usage is only 12.6, so don\u2019t expect many points. Portland only plays three games with a back-to-back on Monday\/Tuesday. It\u2019s a tough week of games as they face the Suns, Nuggets, and Lakers."},{"id":499167,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-feb-22","date":"2021-02-22","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Feb. 22)","content":"Kristaps Porzingis (PF \u2013 DAL) $7,800 vs. MEM I project Porzingis not only to be the highest scoring power forward in tonight\u2019s slate, but to return the best value from the position as well. I like a lot of Mavericks players tonight and their brief break should bring them back fresh. \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d appears to be returning to his old self, averaging 1.4 fantasy points per minute over his last five games. I only see his current price tag rising, so hop on now. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SG \u2013 OKC) $7,500 vs. MIA The Thunder offense basically runs through Gilgeous-Alexander. After coming back from injury, he hit the ground running, playing around 35 minutes with a usage rate just shy of 30% last time out. That is a sweet combination that should lead him well north of 5X vs. the Heat, who have allowed the 29th most fantasy points to shooting guards this season. DeMarcus Cousins (C \u2013 HOU) $6,400 vs. CHI Trade rumors have been swirling around Cousins, and he is questionable, which means there are all sorts of risks in plugging \u201cBoogie\u201d into your lineups tonight. What this means, however, is that his ownership should be very low as people will be skittish to play him. There\u2019s a solid chance tomorrow is a showcase game for him before the Rockets try to shop him. Cousins is coming off a 45.6 fantasy point outing vs. Philadelphia, so he absolutely has the ability to run it back in a better matchup vs. Chicago. Kyle Kuzma (PF \u2013 LAL) $5,700 vs. WAS Kuzma has become a popular play since Anthony Davis went down, and I don\u2019t see that changing tonight. In his last two games, he\u2019s played 34 minutes and tallied 29.8 and 27.8 fantasy points. The Wizards offer a much-improved matchup, so I see Kuzma as a reliable GPP and cash play. He is on the injury report, so keep an eye out for that, but he is currently expected to play. Kendrick Nunn (PG \u2013 MIA) $5,600 at OKC We saw a ceiling game from Nuun last game when he went for 27 points, five boards, and three assists against the Lakers on Saturday. What I really liked about that outing is how Nunn played 39 minutes. Goran Dragic should still be out, and Tyler Herro is now questionable. Herro being ruled out would be the icing on the cake, but as it stands, Nunn is a valid GPP and cash play. His high minutes alone should give him a floor of 25 fantasy points, and we have witnessed his ceiling. Mike Conley (PG \u2013 UTA) $5,600 vs. CHA After missing six games, Conley returned to action Friday, recording 22 fantasy points across 25 minutes. Charlotte offers a bit better matchup than the Clippers, and I expect his minutes to see an uptick. While Conley doesn\u2019t offer too high of a ceiling, I see him finishing with about 30 fantasy points, making him better as a cash option. Eric Gordon (SG \u2013 HOU) $5,300 vs. CHI Obviously, this play is dependent on Victor Oladipo remaining out. Assuming Oladipo is sidelined, Eric Gordon should stay in the starting lineup and reach 30+ minutes. His last two games played have been against the Knicks and the 76ers, so facing the Bulls will give Gordon a nice boost. Gordon is a solid GPP and cash play as he has shown his ability to reach 35+ fantasy points. Garrett Temple (SF \u2013 CHI) $4,600 at HOU Temple has been playing solid of late, scoring 25+ fantasy points in three of his last four games. Monitor the starting lineup, but I expect Temple to earn the start tomorrow and reach 30 minutes or more, which he has been consistently doing in his last six games. I like the pay-up options at small forward today, so I see Temple as more of a contrarian GPP play against a tougher Houston Rockets matchup. Derrick Jones (SF \u2013 POR) $4,600 at PHO In his past three games, Jones has posted north of 25 fantasy points. Granted, those performances were against easier matchups than Phoenix, but he has still been playing well of late and should remain in the starting lineup for tonight. He should see the floor for 30 minutes again tonight, and at $4,600, even if the 24-year-old tallies 25 fantasy points, Jones offers 5X+ value while being a contrarian option. Maxi Kleber (PF \u2013 DAL) $3,900 vs. MEM As a starter on a top-10 efficient offense, $3,900 is simply too cheap for Kleber. Most of the Mavs usage goes to Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, but Kleber will still see the floor for right around 27 minutes. He\u2019s been a 0.78 fantasy points per minute player this year, so he should reach right around 5X value at 20+ points tonight."},{"id":499046,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/the-10-takeaways-from-the-nets-victory-over-the-clippers","date":"2021-02-22","title":"10 takeaways from the Nets' win against the Clippers","content":"That\u2019s a wrap for the Nets\u2019 five-game West road trip. Put a bow tie on it, too \u2014 the Nets went undefeated, winning four without Kevin Durant, and found themselves in the process. All but two games were won by double digits and the against impressive competition in both L.A. teams and the Suns. The Nets were dominant at times and failed to blink whenever challenged, like the final minutes on Sunday. It was the type of trip Brooklyn needed in order to rise in the East, erase most of the issues plaguing them and officially announce themselves as a team to be taken seriously this season. Remember, before the trip began, the Nets were in a state of confusion: Their defense was awful, they played down to the level of their competition far too often, coach Steve Nash\u2019s qualifications were being questioned on social media, and their three stars hadn\u2019t played much together because of injuries and health restrictions. Durant is still recovering from a hamstring issue, but James Harden and Kyrie Irving filled in and the Nets didn\u2019t miss him on the trip. They flew home in style after beating the Clippers, 112-108 , withstanding a late L.A. rally. Here are 10 takeaways from that game and a trip the Nets won\u2019t quickly forget: 1. Nets defense stiffens Look, if what we\u2019re seeing lately is for real, then the Nets are a big problem for the league. After being the butt of jokes and suffering embarrassing losses, the Nets straightened up and tightened up the D \u2014 or at least the effort \u2014 and suddenly nobody\u2019s laughing anymore. Other than Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, nobody troubled Brooklyn, and the Clippers were locked up for much of this game. 2. Paul George watches the outcome  He led the Clippers with 34 points in 33 minutes, but sat the final few minutes of a four-point game, obviously costing the Clippers a primary option and maybe even the game. The Clippers chose to tread carefully with a player who just recently returned from a toe injury and kept him on a minutes restriction. Coach Ty Lue called it \u201ca tough decision.\u201d Fine. But without George, the Clippers in the stretch were forced to rely on Leonard, who was called for an offensive foul with the game tied and Leonard driving for what appeared to be an easy, game-tying bucket against Harden. 3. DeAndre Jordan loves L.A.  He was one of the core players in the \u201cLob City\u201d days and Sunday, he rolled back the clock. Jordan spooked his former team all night, providing defensive intimidation \u2014 four blocks \u2014 along with 11 rebounds and a crucial left-hand tip with 11 seconds left that gave Brooklyn the lead for good. There\u2019s no telling if Jordan can keep this up defensively, let alone in the playoffs. If he can, that\u2019s a big plus, and Brooklyn might even gamble and keep him on the floor for late possessions, risking hack-a-DJ in the process. 4. East up for grabs  Brooklyn is now just a half-game behind first-place Philadelphia and gaining momentum. Everyone had a hunch that, at some point, the Nets would begin to maximize their obvious advantage and show some flex. Now, the top spot in the East is well within their sights. Plus, the Milwaukee Bucks are trying to recover from the losing skid that saw them fall while the Nets rose. The season is tricky and nothing should be set in stone here in late February. It won\u2019t be until the end. 5. Clippers\u2019 PGs creating internal pressure  If there\u2019s a weakness on the Clippers, this is it. Patrick Beverley and Reggie Jackson aren\u2019t natural point guards who create off the dribble and facilitate. Mainly, they dribble up court, throw the ball to Leonard and George and run to the corner. This puts pressure on Leonard and George to constantly revert to 1-on-1 play. This is probably the reality for the rest of the season as the Clippers might not find a true point guard on the buyout market. 6. Nets\u2019 sinister screens  What\u2019s scary about the Nets is how they can destroy teams by using screens to create mismatches for Harden and Irving. They did this multiple times using Jordan, leaving a slower, less mobile big to defend Irving or Harden (Serge Ibaka was victimized repeatedly). That\u2019s the benefit of having supreme isolation players who can shoot as well as get to the rim off the dribble. 7. The Harden and Kyrie connection Any fears that these two ball-dominant players would become as compatible as oil and water can begin to subside somewhat if not completely. Both of these All-Stars \u2014 Kyrie was voted a starter and Harden will surely get the coach\u2019s vote this week as a reserve \u2014 appear to be on the same page and in-step. Their body language is positive and they\u2019re saying all the right things, which means it\u2019s working between them so far. Of course, the big test comes when things aren\u2019t going so well. But given the way the Nets just completed this trip, and with Durant on the way back, Brooklyn might not see much misery in the near future. 8. Leonard\u2019s commitment to the classics  Other than DeMar DeRozan, is there another player who stays old school and uses the mid-range shot to his advantage? Once again, Kawhi showed that you don\u2019t need to obey the analytics crowd and primarily shoot 3-pointers or attack the rim. There can be balance in your game, but too many players believe they can only have a lengthy career and make money if they shoot 3-pointers. Defenses are no longer protecting the mid-range, and Kawhi manages to find that soft spot. 9. Cold hand Luke  The Clippers didn\u2019t have much in terms of assets to use last offseason and eventually spent it all on Ibaka and Luke Kennard. While Ibaka assumed the starting center position and is contributing, Kennard is a disappointment so far since arriving from Detroit in a three-team trade (and then given a four-year, $64 million extension). He\u2019s been timid, unwilling to be the aggressor or shoot with volume. As a result, his minutes are dwindling. He didn\u2019t play against Brooklyn (he did miss the previous game with a minor knee issue) and the Clippers are giving Terance Mann some burn. 10. Bruce Brown, locking it down  Curiously, in that three-team trade involving Kennard, the Nets received Brown, who has played relatively well in 14 starts this season. Brown doesn\u2019t shoot 3-pointers, but his bounce off the dribble and defense are keeping him on the floor. The 6-foot-4 guard had four steals against the Clippers with 13 points and eight rebounds, all in 34 minutes. When Durant heals up, Brown will likely remain a fixture in the rotation. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

That lands him here, though, playing some of the best basketball of his career right now. Over his last 10 games, Vucevic is averaging 52 FD points per game. Most importantly, the offense is being run through him with Aaron Gordon and all of the aforementioned point guards injured. Not to mention, Detroit surrenders the most fantasy points in the NBA to opposing centers. Darius Garland (PG \u2013 CLE) vs. OKC $5,900 Garland is in this article so much that his name is starting to get burned into my screen. The simple fact is, these sites keep him way too cheap. We\u2019re talking about a guy who averaged 34 FanDuel points per game before his injury and has not been far off of that recently. In fact, he\u2019s averaging 28 fantasy points per game across his last 12 outings. That makes it hard to believe he remains below $6,000, especially considering this is a 21-year-old getting better by the day. Not to mention, Oklahoma City ranks 22nd in total defense. Michael Carter-Williams (PG \u2013 ORL) vs. DET $4,500 With Markelle Fultz and Cole Anthony going down, MCW has stumbled into a solid role as the starting point guard in Orlando. Since returning from injury last week, Carter-Williams has played at least 27 minutes in four-straight games, averaging 25.4 FD points per game in that span. That\u2019s really all you can ask for from someone this cheap, and we haven\u2019t even discussed this superb matchup against a 21st-ranked Detroit defense. Al Horford (C \u2013 OKC) at CLE $6,300 Big Al has quietly had a resurgent season for the Thunder, and he really deserves more credit for what he\u2019s done. Since coming off maternity leave last month, Horford has scored at least 27 FanDuel points in nine of his last 11 games. He\u2019s also averaging 37.3 FD points per game in that span, and that makes this price tag look silly. Facing Cleveland only adds to his intrigue, with the Cavaliers ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency. Nerlens Noel (PF \u2013 NYK) vs. MIN $5,300 With Mitchell Robinson out for the next four weeks, Noel will continue to start at the center. While he\u2019s yet to have a big game, we can\u2019t overlook the fact that he\u2019s playing 30 minutes a game as the starter. What\u2019s amazing is that he\u2019s averaging 25 fantasy points per game in that expanded role, despite never taking more than seven shots or reaching double-digits in scoring in any game. That means he could go nut if he records a double-double, which he\u2019s certainly capable of when you look at some of his past statistics. Danilo Gallinari (SF \u2013 ATL) vs. DEN $4,600 Gallo\u2019s numbers are not going to sway you to use him but look a little deeper. He\u2019s actually seen his minutes slowly creep up recently, playing at least 24 minutes in four-straight. What we really like is that he\u2019s taken at least 13 shots in three of those outings. If he keeps playing that much and taking that many shots, it\u2019s just a matter of time before he starts dropping 25-plus fantasy points at ease. A revenge game against his former team could spark him, too, with Denver surrendering the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing small forwards. Cedi Osman (SF \u2013 CLE) vs. OKC $5,400 With Andre Drummond, Kevin Love, Larry Nance Jr, and Taurean Prince all nicked up, Osman remains a fantastic value. This guy\u2019s been productive all season when given the minutes, scoring at least 28 FD points in the nine games he\u2019s played at least 32 minutes. While he didn\u2019t reach 32 minutes on Friday, Osman still dropped 31 FD points! If you get that from a $5,400 player, you\u2019ll have no problem fitting in two or three of the studs we\u2019ll discuss later on. Dennis Smith Jr. (PG \u2013 DET) vs. MIN $4,600 Now that Derrick Rose is in New York and Delon Wright is dealing with a groin issue, it\u2019s time to see what DSJ can do! He\u2019s the only point guard remaining, providing 28 FD points across 23 minutes of action in that fill-in on Friday. This is a former top-pick, and he definitely has the ability to go off if given the opportunity. The best part about this might be the matchup, though, with Minnesota ranked 27th in points allowed and 24th in defensive efficiency. Will Barton (SF \u2013 DEN) at ATL $5,200 The Nuggets are yet another short-handed team, missing guys like Gary Harris, P.J. Dozier, Paul Millsap, and JaMychal Green. That leaves the wing positions very thin, forcing Barton into some big minutes. That\u2019s evident when you see that Barton has played at least 34 minutes in six of his last seven games. He\u2019s definitely had some duds in that stretch, but he\u2019s too talented to be this cheap, especially with a workload like this. Seth Curry (SG \u2013 PHI) at TOR $4,000 Curry was clearly hampered in his return from COVID, but recent results would indicate that he\u2019s over it. He\u2019s played at least 34 minutes in five-straight games, averaging over 21 FD points per game across his last seven outings. That might not sound too great, but it\u2019s really all you can ask for from a $4K player. Toronto\u2019s not the defense we used to fear either, ranked 16th in defensive efficiency."},{"id":498502,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-wright-has-groin-strain-will-be-reevaluated-in-2-weeks","date":"2021-02-21","title":"Pistons' Delon Wright has groin strain, will be reevaluated in 2 weeks","content":"The Detroit Pistons announced today that guard Delon Wright suffered a grade 2 right groin strain at Memphis on February 19 and will be reevaluated in two weeks.

The Pelicans have outscored their opponents by 37 points in this 350 minutes with this lineup on the court. \u2022 Zion Williamson ranks 14th in the NBA in scoring at 25.0 ppg with 18.7 of those points coming inside the paint \u2013 the most by any player in the league as Zion holds a 1.8 ppg advantage over second-ranked Giannis Antetokounmpo. Of Williamson\u2019s 432 field goal attempts this season, only 20 have come outside the paint (4.6% of his total shots). \u2022 Over the past five games, Williamson is averaging 30.4 ppg and shooting 71.3% from the field. His scoring ranks ninth among all players and his shooting percentage leads the 106 players that average 10 shot attempts per game. \u2022 The Celtics rank fifth in the league in points off turnovers (18.9 per game), fueled by their 8.2 steals per game (8th). The Pelicans allow 17.5 points off turnovers per game (9th-most in the league) Nets at Clippers (22-9)  8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 This is a matchup of the top two offenses in the league with Brooklyn leading the NBA in offensive efficiency (117.9) and the Clippers only slightly behind (117.4). Five of the top 21 scorers in the league (removing minimum games played threshold) represent these two teams, with four expected to be in action on Sunday as Kevin Durant (29.0 ppg) will miss his fourth straight game for Brooklyn. \u2022 The Nets won the first meeting with the Clippers on Feb. 2 behind Kyrie Irving\u2019s 39 points (his 2nd-highest scoring game of the season) and James Harden\u2019s triple-double (23 pts, 14 ast, 12 reb). Harden has five triple-doubles in his 17 games with the Nets \u2014 one more than he had all last season with Houston in 68 games played. Nicolas Batum was the primary defender on Irving for a team-high 3:33 (33.7% of Irving\u2019s matchup time) and held him to six points on 2-for-2 shooting. Reggie Jackson defended Irving for 3:25 (32.3% of matchup time) and allowed 15 points on 6-for-9 shooting from the field and 3-for-5 on 3-pointers. \u2022 The Nets have the highest effective field goal percentage (58.9%) and highest true shooting percentage (62.4%) of any team on record dating back to the 1996-97 season in both categories. The only other team in the past 24 years to post a TS% over 60% is the 2017-18 Warriors (60.3%). The Clippers are also on pace to top that mark by the Warriors as LA ranks second in TS% at 60.5%. \u2022 Brooklyn enters Sunday having won its last five games , which is the longest active win streak in the league and the team\u2019s longest streak since winning six in a row from Jan. 14-25, 2019 . During the win streak, Kyrie Irving has averaged 28.5 points on 54.8% shooting from the field and 48.1% on 3-pointers, while James Harden has added 25.6 points on 51.9-47.6-96.3 shooting splits and 11.4 assists per game. \u2022 The Clippers lead the league in 3-point shooting at 41.9% shooting as a team, followed by Brooklyn at 40.9%. A key difference in the 3-point shooting for these two teams can be found when looking at assisted vs. unassisted 3-point shots. The Clippers rank seventh in the league with 86.6% of their 3-pointers being assisted , while the Nets rank 27th with only 76.4% of their 3-pointers coming off an assist.

(AP) \u2014 Draymond Green lost his cool and the Golden State Warriors lost another game. After Green picked up two technical fouls and was ejected with 9.3 seconds left for arguing the outcome of a jump ball, Terry Rozier hit an off-balance jumper from the left corner as time expired to give the Charlotte Hornets a 102-100 victory Saturday night Rozier finished with 36 points, his fourth straight 30-point game. The Warriors were leading by two when officials ruled Hornets coach James Borrego had called a timeout as Gordon Hayward came down with the jump ball. Green immediately began jumping around the court, screaming at players and officials arguing that the Warriors had tied up Hayward as he was falling to the floor and it should have resulted in another jump ball. Rozier sank two free throws for the technical fouls to tie it, then hit the winner. \u201cHe crossed the line, that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said about Green, who has a history of in-game outbursts. \u201cWe love his passion and his energy and we would not be the team we are without him. But that doesn\u2019t give him license to cross the line \u2014 and he knows that.\u201d Head official Marc Davis said after the game Green\u2019s first technical foul was assessed for directing profanity at an opposing player and taunting, and the second technical was for directing profanity at a game official. Green did not participate in the Warriors\u2019 videoconference call after the game. Kerr said Green was apologetic after the game, but he will speak to him in private more about the incident. Teammates were quick to rally to Green\u2019s defense. \u201cHe said it was his fault and he took ownership as a leader,\u201d forward Eric Paschall said. \u201cWe are still rocking with Draymond. Great dude. Great competitor.\u201d The incident overshadowed another huge night for Rozier, who had 20 points in the fourth quarter. Rozier is averaging 37.5 points over the last four games for the Hornets. \u201cI just hit one or two shots before that in that corner, so I felt real confident when I lost the ball, I grabbed it and let it go,\u201d Rozier said of the winning shot. \u201cI saw it going through all the way.\u201d Borrego said Rozier has brought a \u201cwinning spirit\u201d to the Hornets. \u201cNever give in, never die. That\u2019s as simple as I can put it,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cHe\u2019s been fantastic. His will throughout games and fourth quarters just to keep us alive and to actually throw in daggers to help us win games is tremendous on his part. But he\u2019s been fantastic.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * The Warriors took a major curve ball just minutes before tipoff Saturday in Charlotte with the late scratch of team leader Stephen Curry . But even without his team-high 29.9 points per game, the Warriors still found themselves clinging to a two-point lead in the final seconds. Then \u2026 bedlam. GAME SITUATION: LaMelo Ball and Brad Wanamaker contested a jump ball at center court with 13.3 seconds left. Draymond Green and Gordon Hayward fell to the court as they battled for the ensuing loose ball, with the Hornets granted time out despite possession being questionable. This infuriated Green, whose meltdown earned a pair of technical fouls and a mandatory ejection.  Terry Rozier made both free throws to tie the game at 100 apiece with 9.3 seconds left, setting the stage for his fading, falling-out-of-bounds 20-footer from the left wing, which launched just over Juan Toscano-Anderson\u2019s outstretched hand. DIFFICULTY: Pretty, pretty high. Rozier is lighting it up from 3-point range this season, with his percentage ticking up to a sizzling 46.0 after drilling 8-for-11 against the Warriors. But the midrange has been his Achilles heel at just 30.4% on long 2s, the second-lowest showing of his career. Making matters even more tenuous, Rozier had made a grand total of just one shot from that general area on the left side all season. All of which is to say it was anything but his sweet spot, even under optimal, non-crucial circumstances. But you couldn\u2019t tell from the end result, as Rozier rose up and sank the shot with confidence.  CELEBRATION: The usual swarm-the-guy-who-made-the-shot stuff. Perhaps more notable was the reaction of Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who tried to boot the ball into the stands. In perhaps yet another sign that it just wasn\u2019t meant to be for the Warriors, he appeared to pull back at the last second and squibbed the ball instead. As for Rozier, his winner capped a 36-point night for the sixth-year guard, including 20 in the fourth quarter and 10 over the final 1:18. 3.5 Horrys"},{"id":498106,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chris-paul-surpasses-oscar-robertson-for-6th-in-career-assists","date":"2021-02-21","title":"Chris Paul surpasses Oscar Robertson for 6th in career assists","content":"Veteran Suns point guard Chris Paul has surpassed Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson for sixth place among the NBA\u2019s career assists leaders.

He gets a Wizards squad surrendering the fifth-most FanDuel points to opposing centers this season and just dropped 39 FanDuel points against them back on Feb. 2. Combine that with the fact that this matchup has the highest over-under on the slate, and Kanter is a lock to exceed 6X value. Kyle Kuzma (PF \u2013 LAL) $5,900 While Miami ranks inside the top 10 in defensive efficiency, they\u2019ve primarily struggled to contain opposing power forwards this season, surrendering the third-most FanDuel points to the position. Kuzma is the next man up now that Anthony Davis will be out of the lineup for four weeks, and that was clear in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Nets when he put up 16 points and nine rebounds in 34 minutes. He\u2019s averaging just under 14.0 points and 6.7 rebounds in 29.0 minutes during the seven games Davis has missed this season. Gary Trent Jr. (SG \u2013 POR) $5,500 Portland has won its last six games, and Trent has played a huge part in that. The sharpshooter has averaged 19.6 points on just under 46% from beyond the arc during February and just lit up the Wizards for 26 points back on Feb. 2. As previously stated, I want as many pieces of this game as possible, and Trent\u2019s $5,500 salary is too good to pass up in this likely shootout. Mikal Bridges (SF \u2013 PHO) $5,300 Bridges is averaging 33.3 minutes for the Suns this season. The Grizzlies surrender the fifth-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards this season. Also, considering the fact that the 24 year old lit them up for 34.6 FanDuel points earlier this season, Bridges\u2019 price has fallen more than $200 from his season average of $5,500. Cody Zeller (C \u2013 CHA) $5,100 Despite seeing a small decline in minutes, Zeller has accumulated at least 10 points and seven rebounds in four of his last five games. He gets a Warriors team that\u2019s been middle of the pack defending opposing centers this season but will be without James Wiseman and Kevon Looney once again, forcing the 6-foot-6 Juan Toscano-Anderson to see minutes at center behind Draymond Green. For what it\u2019s worth, Golden State will be playing its third game in four nights while Charlotte hasn\u2019t played since Valentine\u2019s Day. Zeller could easily push for 6X value in a high-scoring affair. Davis Bertans (PF \u2013 WAS) $4,700 Coming off a career-high 35 points and nine 3s, Bertans is sizzling at the moment and gets a matchup against the team surrendering the most FanDuel points to his position this season. Given that 253 total points were scored the last time these two teams met, the stars are aligning for Bertans to have yet another monster game. Priced at only $4,700, he may be the best value in the entire slate. Cory Joseph (PG \u2013 SAC) $4,100 The crafty vet has seen 27 minutes per game over his last four games as Sacramento looks to find some stability in their rotation. Over that span, he\u2019s averaged 15 points, 2.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and just under 25 FanDuel points per game and now gets a Bulls team ranking in the bottom half of the league in defensive efficiency. The Kings have lost five in a row and desperately need a win, which could prompt Joseph to play an even bigger role on Saturday. Garrett Temple (SF \u2013 CHI) $4,200 Temple has seen 30+ minutes in each of his last five games while averaging just under 25 FanDuel points per contest. The Kings give up the seventh-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards this season, and Temple\u2019s $4,200 price tag makes him a bargain considering his recent production. Talen Horton-Tucker (SG \u2013 LAL) $4,000 This is a sneaky play as most will pivot to Alex Caruso in light of Dennis Schroder\u2019s absence. However, THT was given more minutes and out-produced Caruso in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Nets after it was announced that Schroder wouldn\u2019t play due to the league\u2019s health protocols regarding Covid-19. Miami provides an interesting matchup for Horton-Tucker, as they surrender the second-most FanDuel points to his position this season. If he can get near 27 minutes again on Saturday, he will be a lock to hit 6X value. De\u2019Anthony Melton (PG \u2013 MEM) $3,800 Apparently, many forget what Melton was doing before going down with a shoulder injury earlier this month. In the five games leading up to his injury, Melton was averaging 27.1 FanDuel points per game and just posted 24.1 FanDuel points in only 17 minutes in Friday\u2019s return. Given that Dillon Brooks is questionable and his minutes should be slightly increased, Melton is a fantastic value play against the Suns."},{"id":497963,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-abc-saturday-primetime-feb-20-2021","date":"2021-02-20","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ABC Saturday Primetime, Feb. 20, 2021","content":"\u2022 The Lakers rank fifth in the league in scoring inside the key, averaging 52.3 points in the paint per game.

Knocking off 12 months of rust wasn\u2019t quite as easy. Thomas scored 19 points in his first competitive game in more than a year, helping the U.S. to a 93-77 victory over the Bahamas on Friday in a FIBA AmeriCup qualifying game. \u201cMy first time playing in a little over a year so I was a little rusty, but it felt amazing to be out there competing against really good players and also representing my country,\u201d Thomas said. The 32-year-old Thomas is a two-time NBA All-Star who scored 28.9 points per game for the Boston Celtics in the 2016-17 season. But he suffered a hip injury late in that season and has never regained that form in limited opportunities. He decided to play for the Americans partly as a showcase in hopes of earning his way back into the NBA, where he most recently played for Washington last February. Thomas \u2014 like many NBA players \u2014 had some trouble adjusting to the ball and the way the international game is officiated. But he was pleased with his movement and conditioning and said he\u2019ll clean up his mistakes Saturday. \u201cThe world knows I\u2019ve got what it takes. So ,it\u2019s just about showing that I\u2019m healthy,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cMy skill didn\u2019t go anywhere, it was just about getting a hundred percent healthy, which I am right now.\u201d The 5-foot-9 guard shot the Americans out to an 11-2 lead with his three straight 3-pointers. But he also committed six turnovers that helped keep the Bahamas in the game far longer than expected, with one particularly rough stretch in the second quarter when he had back-to-back turnovers and then a shot blocked. U.S. coach Joe Prunty thought Thomas played well. \u201cYes, definite turnovers,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cThere were certain things defensively, assignments where he had to fight through things. Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s part of our defense though in terms of communication. It\u2019s not always just on one guy.\u201d \u201cBut overall I was very pleased with how he moved on the floor. Was able to get us in our offense for the most part, execute our offense and obviously make some shots. James Nunnally also scored 19 points for the Americans, They improved to 5-0 in qualifying play and can remain perfect through three windows by beating Mexico on Saturday. The U.S. has already clinched a berth in the AmeriCup tournament to be played in 2022, but brought a strong roster to San Juan that features eight players who have NBA regular-season experience. Along with Thomas, the other noteworthy name was seven-time All-Star Joe Johnson, who finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Still, the U.S. led by only 10 in the fourth quarter after beating the Bahamas by 40 in the November window. The lead was still just 83-72 before Thomas made a layup and 3-pointer to push it to 88-72 and the Americans finally coasted from there. The qualifying games were added as a way to give national teams the opportunity to play home games, but all four teams in Group D are playing this weekend in San Juan in a bubble setup because of the coronavirus. Brandon Bass finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds for the U.S. But another former NBA player, Treveon Graham, left the game with an apparent leg injury in the third quarter.

It was Gobert\u2019s second 20-20 game of the season; Andre Drummond (3) is the only other player with multiple 20-20 games , while four other players have one. \u2022 In Tuesday\u2019s matchup, Serge Ibaka was the primary defender on Rudy Gobert for a team-high 4:14 (37.7% of offensive matchup time) and held Gobert to two points on zero field goal attempts and only two free throws. Im 3:36 against Ivica Zubac, Gobert scored seven points 3-5 from the field. \u2022 The Jazz are seeking their second streak of at least 10 wins this season as they enter Thursday having won nine straight and 20 of their last 21 games. During this 21-game stretch , the Jazz are averaging 118.3 ppg, led by Donovan Mitchell as 25.4 ppg , while Jordan Clarkson has added 19.2 off the Jazz bench. For the season, Clarkson leads all players in bench scoring (18.2 ppg) as the Jazz rank seventh in bench scoring (38.1 ppg). \u2022 Both the Clippers (117.4, 3rd) and Jazz (116.5, 4th) rank in the top four in offensive efficiency this seaosn. The difference comes on the defensive side of the ball as the Jazz rank second in defensive efficiency (106.9) while the Clippers ranks 12 (110.6). The Jazz are the only team to rank in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency in fact Phoenix is the only team to rank in the top 10 in both categories. \u2022 The Clippers (42.2%) and Jazz (38.3%) rank second and fourth, respectively, in 3-point percentage this season. Both teams also rank in the top seven in 3-point defense , as the Jazz allow opponents to shoot 35.2% (4th) and the Clippers allow 35.4% (7th). The Jazz limit their opponents to just 31.2 3-point attempts (2nd-fewest allowed), while the Clipper allow 33.3 (10th)."},{"id":497202,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-friday-feb-19","date":"2021-02-19","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Friday (Feb. 19)","content":"Ricky Rubio (PG \u2013 MIN) $5,300 vs. TOR One of the least exciting players to add to your DFS lineups, Rubio still offers value tonight, and I see him as more of a cash play. He consistently plays 28-29 minutes and consistently scores in the mid to upper-20s, spiking a 45.1 fantasy point outing against the Pacers in overtime. At $5,300, I expect him to reach just above 5X value vs. the Raptors. Daniel Theis (PF \u2013 BOS) $4,900 vs. ATL Theis has missed some time with an injury but is expected to be back against Atlanta tonight. At $4,900, he looks like a solid cash play, as I believe his ceiling to be limited. When he\u2019s been healthy, he\u2019s played between 25-30 minutes consistently, and I can easily see him reaching 30 fantasy points in a pace-up spot vs. the Hawks, returning a nice value if he reaches that mark. If he remains out by chance, just run it back with Robert Williams ($3,600) in the center spot. Eric Bledsoe (SG \u2013 NO) $4,800 vs. PHO Going against a negative matchup in the Suns, Bledsoe represents a solid contrarian play for today\u2019s slate. His minutes have fluctuated over his last four games, but he has shown his capability of returning 5X value or higher. As a starter in a nine-game slate with low projected ownership, take a couple of shots at Bledsoe in your GPP lineups. Michael Carter-Williams (PG \u2013 ORL) $4,500 vs. GS As the starting point guard for the Magic, Carter-Williams has performed relatively well, averaging 25.7 fantasy points over his three games. He\u2019s sitting right around 30 minutes per game, and in a pace-up spot against Golden State, he could see a bit more looks. Carter-Williams should return solid value but has a limited ceiling, so it is a fine pay-down option in GPP\u2019s and cash tournaments. Patrick Williams (PF \u2013 CHI) $4,500 at PHI I wrote about Williams last time, and I\u2019m running it right back again tonight. While he isn\u2019t the most efficient player, he is essentially locked in for 30 minutes per game. There aren\u2019t many spend-down power forward options, and facing a tough Sixers defense, I expect Williams\u2019 ownership to be quite minimal, so he offers a great contrarian play in large-field tournaments. Willy Hernangomez (C \u2013 NO) $4,400 vs. PHO With Steven Adams going down yesterday, I assume he will be out for some time. Cue Hernangomez. The Pelicans center should slot right in and see a massive minutes bump to the mid-30s. What I really like about Hernangomez for this specific slate is that there are a lot of solid center options, so he makes for a fine contrarian GPP play that should still return solid value. JaMychal Green (PF \u2013 DEN) $4,200 at CLE After burning people on Tuesday, Green came right back out on Wednesday against Washington, totaling 35 fantasy points. He did come away from that game with an injury, so not only should you monitor his injury, but the rest of the Nuggets as well. Green played just shy of 30 minutes each of his last two games, so if he is good to go, and the Nuggets that are expected to be out stay out, Green offers solid value at $4,200. Cedi Osman (SF \u2013 CLE) $4,200 vs. PHI Considering he just went off for 36 fantasy points, I am surprised to see Osman still down at $4,200. I expect the Cleveland small forward to remain in the starting lineup, especially if Taurean Prince and Dylan Windler remain out. If that is the case, Osman is a solid GPP and cash play, as he should see the floor for upwards of 30 minutes again."},{"id":497206,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/utahs-quin-snyder-earns-spot-as-coach-of-team-lebron-in-2021-nba-all-star-game","date":"2021-02-19","title":"Utah's Quin Snyder earns spot as coach of Team LeBron in 2021 NBA All-Star Game","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Utah Jazz head coach Quin Snyder and his staff will coach Team LeBron in the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, which will take place on Sunday, March 7 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

But as you know, the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder isn\u2019t about career achievements (they\u2019re definitely fun to watch , though). This comes down to impact; how a player is presently and positively affecting his team\u2019s fortunes on the floor. Despite scoring 32 points to go with eight rebounds and seven assists, James and the Lakers came up short Thursday in a 109-98 loss to Brooklyn in which his squad played without Anthony Davis (calf) and Dennis Schr\u00f6der (health and safety protocols), against a formidable potential NBA Finals foe missing Kevin Durant (hamstring). After the game, Lakers coach Frank Vogel delivered news that Davis \u201cis gonna be out for four weeks,\u201d which only increases the burden for James to carry the Lakers, who have dropped two of their last three games. \u201cHe\u2019s got to play his game, and we\u2019ve got to find ways where he can impact the game sort of with less energy,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cPutting him at the elbow, putting him at the low post, where he\u2019s not running a million pick-and-rolls; just try to manage it that way. He\u2019s got a great feel for that. If he needs a blow, he\u2019s gonna get himself out or ask for a sub. We\u2019re looking at those types of ways to, within his minutes, make sure he\u2019s not carrying too much of a load.\u201d But that\u2019s what MVPs do, and James\u2019 efforts up to this point serve as a major reason the Lakers are 5-2 without Davis in the lineup. \u201cComing into the season, we already knew it was going to be a challenge,\u201d James said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise when you\u2019re hit with some adversity. I think adversity builds character, and that\u2019s how you handle it. So, nothing changes for me.\u201d James remains at No. 1 in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. But you\u2019ll see somewhat of a shakeup in the top five as Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry earn their way into the party, while Nikola Jokic slips a couple of spots. Donovan Mitchell continues to rise along with 2018 MVP James Harden, while Durant and Kawhi Leonard fall back due to their injury-related absences. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Season stats:  25.9 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 7.9 apg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 His minutes have increased in each of the last three months, and naturally, so has the productivity. Expect more from the 36-year-old with Davis expected to miss four weeks. James is shooting 54.3% from the field in February, but one area of concern is his accuracy from long range. James connected on 35.5% on 3\u2019s in December and 42.9% in January, only for that percentage over nine games this month to plunge to 26.8%. The entire team seems to be fighting through a 3-point shooting slump, as they now rank 19 th from range (35.8%). Season stats: 29.7 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 1.2 bpg, 1.3 spg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Writhing in pain with a lower back injury, Embiid carried Philly again in Wednesday\u2019s victory over the Houston Rockets, to snap a three-game skid. Embiid put up 31 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists with DeMarcus Cousins guarding him most of the night for his 12 th straight outing with 25 points or more. Critics knock Embiid for missing six games. But what we witnessed against Houston was as gutsy a performance as you\u2019ll see. Hopefully, Embiid\u2019s back issues clear up some going into tonight\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls. Season stats:  29.8 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 7.7 apg, 1.1 spg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 8 The Hulu ad campaign should just air this man\u2019s recent highlights on a loop with Lillard in the background freestyling, \u201cHulu. Has. Live. Sports.\u201d It\u2019s just flat out ridiculous what he\u2019s doing in shouldering the load in Portland with CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic nursing injuries. Clutch time is definitely Dame time, as he\u2019s 12-3 in those situations, burning the opposition down the stretch, sinking 58.8% from deep in the last five minutes of games separated by five points or fewer. He\u2019s not an All-Star starter, but neither was Russell Westbrook the year he won MVP. Season stats:  30.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 6.0 apg, 1.2 spg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 7 Had knocked down 51% from 3-point range in the 10 games before Wednesday\u2019s ice-cold night against the Miami Heat. Curry even set a new career record for his most missed 3-pointers in a game, as he finished 5 of 20 from deep on the night. Still, Curry kept shooting it and answered the call when needed to pace Golden State\u2019s OT victory over the heat. Curry continues to carry the undermanned Warriors, keeping them squarely in playoff contention. MVP candidacy, from this vantage point, isn\u2019t as much about numbers as it is impact. Curry checks that box. Season stats:  27.4 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 8.6 apg, 1.6 spg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Denver is on a two-game skid going into tonight\u2019s matchup at Cleveland , and although Jokic has poured in 76 points over his last two outings, you can\u2019t discount what transpired in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the 9-17 Washington Wizards. The Wizards outrebounded Denver 46-42, and outscored the Nuggets in the paint 50-44, finishing with a season-high 21 second-chance points. Jokic is averaging nearly a triple-double, yet needs more help, no doubt. Wilt Chamberlain is the only center to average at least eight assists in a season (8.6), and Jokic is on pace to do it, too. 6. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz 7 .

The uncertainty came not from the game, but after it, when Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel disclosed that All-NBA big man Anthony Davis\u2019 would miss at least another four weeks after his aggravated right Achilles\u2019 tendon had been re-evaluated by team doctors. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be out for four weeks,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe want to try to put this fully behind him, be conservative with it just to make sure it\u2019s fully healed before he\u2019s back. Davis exited the Lakers\u2019 game at Denver on Sunday after the nagging injury took a turn for the worse. An MRI revealed no structural damage , but the defending NBA champions are taking no chances with the superstar for whom they traded all their available draft capital to acquire in 2019. Thursday\u2019s loss was L.A.\u2019s second in a three-game span. Both defeats saw the Lakers fall well short of their 112.4 points-per-game average while giving up a torrid 43% from 3-point range, far above the 35.2% clip they normally yield. Davis has not played up to his usual superb standard this season, averaging his lowest scoring and rebounding numbers (22.5 ppg, 8.4 rpg) since his first two seasons in the league. Even so, his absence is felt strongly by the Lakers, whose net rating dips from plus-9.1 when he plays to plus-4.4 when he sits. With guard Dennis Schroder also indefinitely unavailable while completing the league\u2019s Health and Safety Protocols, the Lakers could be severely undermanned through the rest of the first-half season schedule, with Davis likely missing games beyond the All-Star break.

Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo are the first ever to accomplish the feat on multiple occasions. The Heat\u2019s All-Star tandem did so for the second time on Thursday in Miami\u2019s 118-110 victory at Sacramento. Butler finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 13 assists, while Adebayo amassed 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. Theirs is just the 12th such occurrence of teammate triple-doubles in the same game in NBA history. The duo first reached that milestone in an overtime win over Atlanta on Dec. 10, 2019. The pair of performances, along with a joint trip to the 2020 Finals, punctuate the duo\u2019s resounding success as part of the Heat\u2019s most talented core since Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and LeBron James in the early 2010s. The Heat selected Adebayo 14th overall in the 2017 Draft, an end-of-the-lottery home run that helped rejuvenate the franchise. Butler, meanwhile, arrived via sign-and-trade in July, 2019, after short stints in Philadelphia and Minnesota following a promising six-year start with the Chicago Bulls. Miami, however, has struggled amid injuries and player availability this season.

The climb continued on Thursday against the Nets , as James joined Abdul-Jabbar and Malone as the only players to surpass 35,000 career points. He reached the milestone in the manner that has defined much of his career, bulling his way to the paint and earning free throws after the defense tried in vain to stop him in the first half. Like Abdul-Jabbar and Malone, James\u2019 outstanding durability and longevity have seen him produce at a historically consistent pace. Now in his 18th season, the Lakers superstar is on pace to average at least 25 points per game for the 17th consecutive year, the only exception being his rookie campaign in Cleveland. James would need roughly 134 more regular season games at that clip to catch Abdul-Jabbar (38,387), and more if his average declines.

LeBron does it again. It\u2019s been fairly clear since the polls opened three weeks ago that LeBron James was going to wind up being the Captain, again, of his All-Star squad. That honor goes to the top vote-getter in each conference \u2014 it has for the past four years, anyway, dating back to 2018 when the system of captains picking teams playground-style began \u2014 and James was the No. 1 guy after both the first and second week of returns. You\u2019d have to go back 10 years to find someone in James\u2019 conference finishing ahead of him in balloting. In 2011, both Dwight Howard (1,600,390) and Derrick Rose (1,514,723) surpassed James (1,360,680) that winter. Otherwise, he\u2019s been King of that particular hill. We noted last week that the Lakers\u2019 Kia NBA MVP candidate was headed toward his eighth crown in fan voting, good for second place behind Michael Jordan\u2019s nine since fan voting began in 1975. We also need to note that, with his 17th All-Star selection, James is creeping closer to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s record 19 selections over 20 seasons. Abdul-Jabbar went as a rookie in 1970 \u2014 for the 20th edition of the NBA showcase \u2014 and still was chosen in his final season in 1989. Given this will be the 70th All-Star Game, more than half have featured Kareem or LeBron. Brooklyn\u2019s Kevin Durant received the most fan votes among Eastern Conference players, so he\u2019ll serve as captain of the other squad. Durant will be joined by Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid in the East frontcourt. James\u2019 fellow starters in the West frontcourt, by ballot, are Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard. 2. Can\u2019t take Curry for granted. Day-to-day, it can seem as if the Golden State guard does get taken for granted. Here he is, having a season that is thrusting him into MVP speculation, but many react as if it\u2019s to be expected, post-injuries and regardless of teammates. Well, Curry\u2019s game and fame weren\u2019t lost on All-Star voters, who locked him in overwhelmingly as the No. 1 backcourt choice. Heck, the Warriors star got over 1 million votes last season for the game in Chicago, even though he was limited to just five games by a broken left hand. With that and 2016 (Kobe Bryant\u2019s final season) as exceptions, Curry has been the top guard choice out West each year since 2014. Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic \u2014 who tied with Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard \u2014 will start alongside Curry on the strength of a second-place finish in the fan vote, earning a spot for the second consecutive year. 3. No chip on Beal\u2019s shoulder. For four seasons, Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal had numbers that were All-Star worthy. Twice he was added to the East squad as a reserve by the vote of conference coaches, twice he was left off, including in 2020. This time, the fans \u2014 who never had voted Beal higher than ninth \u2014 delivered Beal a starting spot by making him the No. 1 choice in the East backcourt. (Fan balloting accounts for 50% of the vote in selecting All-Star starters. Current players and a media panel account for 25% each.) Beal\u2019s NBA-best 32.8 scoring average screamed for inclusion, while Washington\u2019s 8-17 record when the polls closed did not. Some players have used a perceived All-Star snub as fuel, but his coach said that wasn\u2019t Beal\u2019s style, even if he needed it this year. \u201cIf you need a fan vote, a media vote, a coaches\u2019 vote, a coach always telling you you\u2019ve got to play harder or work on this, you\u2019re going to be short-lived,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks told reporters Thursday. \u201cBrad is self-motivated.\u201d Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving beat out Nets teammate James Harden for the second guard spot in the East. 4. Ready for reserves? Here\u2019s a West guess. \u201cSnubs\u201d is such a downer word, with some level of malice contained within. Any of us can disagree with the vote totals, but it\u2019s hard to conceive some conspiracy to slight this guy or that guy. What we can do once the starters are selected is look at the players who finished fourth and beyond in the frontcourt, third and below in the back, and find the players most likely to be sent to Atlanta by the coaches. In the West, the next five \u2014 three frontline players, two guards \u2014 seems easy enough: Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell in the backcourt, with the Clippers\u2019 Paul George, New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson and the Jazz\u2019s Rudy Gobert up front. Gobert slots in nicely with Lakers big man Anthony Davis out with a strained calf for 2-3 weeks. The coaches also get to pick two wild-card spots to flesh out All-Star rosters to 12 men. In the West, opting for Phoenix\u2019s backcourt of Devin Booker and Chris Paul would round out the group. 5. The best of the rest out East. Who are the most deserving candidates in the Eastern Conference who missed out in the balloting for starters? Filling out a second team should be four-fifths simple, because Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis, Brooklyn\u2019s James Harden and the Celtics\u2019 Jaylen Brown all are thriving on teams that are winning. Coaches like that winning stuff, y\u2019know. That\u2019s make the other three East spots a bit trickier, but New York\u2019s Julius Randle, Chicago\u2019s Zach LaVine and Orlando\u2019s Nikola Vucevic \u2014 despite laboring on teams south of .500 \u2014 have earned them through their play. Here\u2019s another way for the coaches who typically like to reward winning to frame this: As Sirius XM\u2019s \u201cNBA Today\u201d co-host Justin Termine says, if the clubs and the league want All Star-worthy players to stick with their franchises and work toward improvement rather than bolting to glamour markets or super teams, don\u2019t penalize top players who stay rather than go. Don\u2019t short them on individual accolades while the team success is coming. There are a few others worth considering as East reserves, including Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons, whose offense isn\u2019t gaudy, though his defense is; Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young, Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler (lot of missed games, though), and Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton, who quietly is having his best season yet. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

James (5,922,554 fan votes) and Durant (5,567,106 fan votes) led their respective conferences and position groups in fan voting. Curry (5,481,033 fan votes) and Beal (3,485,051 fan votes) also led their respective position groups in fan voting. After all votes were tallied, players were ranked in each conference by position (guard and frontcourt) within each of the three voting groups \u2013 fan votes, player votes and media votes. Each player\u2019s score was calculated by averaging his weighted rank from the fan votes, the player votes and the media votes. The two guards and three frontcourt players with the best score in each conference were named NBA All-Star Game starters. Fan votes served as the tiebreaker for players in a position group with the same score. Don\u010di\u0107 won the tiebreaker with the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Damian Lillard for the second starting spot in the Western Conference guard group. Below are the overall scores \u2013 based on results from all three voting groups \u2013 for the top finishers at each position. Each player\u2019s score is weighted based on 50 percent for fan vote, 25 percent for player vote and 25 percent for media vote.

The Raptors are 4-1 this season when VanVleet scores at least 30 points. \u2022 While Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a game-high 34 points on Tuesday, Khris Middleton (Milwaukee\u2019s second-leading scorer on the season at 20.3 ppg) was held to just 11 points on eight shot attempts \u2013 his second-lowest marks of the year in both categories. Norman Powell defended Middleton for a 4:26 (35.1% of Middleton\u2019s offensive matchup time) and held him scoreless and without even a field goal attempt or assist. \u2022 The Bucks (16.3 ppg, 1st) and Raptors (15.5 ppg, 5th) both rank in the top five in fast break points this season.

The Bucks have the edge in accuracy as they rank third in 3-point percentage at 39.8% while the Raptors rank sixth at 38.6%. A key for Milwaukee is taking advantage of open looks \u2013 they rank fourth in wide-open 3-pointers made (8.8 per game), attempted (20.9 per game) and accuracy (41.9%) with the closest defender at least six feet away. \u2022 Over the past 10 games , Pascal Siakam is averaging a team-high 24.4 points on 47.3% shooting from them field and 37.8% on 3-point attempts, with four 30-point games during this stretch.

What are the key dates for NBA All-Star 2021? Starters revealed: Feb. 18 Reserves revealed: Feb. 22 All-Star Draft: March 4 2021 All-Star Game: March 7 What is the competitive format for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game?  The 2021 NBA All-Star Game will have the same competitive format as the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. The two All-Star teams will compete to win each quarter for their respective beneficiaries. (More details about the beneficiaries and the awarding of donations are forthcoming.) The fourth quarter will be untimed and the teams will play to a Final Target Score, meaning that the game will end with a made basket or a made free throw instead of with the clock running out. How does the competitive format work? Each of the first three quarters will begin with the score of 0-0 and will last 12 minutes. The winner of each 12-minute quarter (first, second and third) will be the team that scores the most points within that quarter. At the start of the fourth quarter, the game clock will be turned off and a Final Target Score will be set. Once the Final Target Score is set, the teams will play an untimed fourth quarter and the first team to reach (or surpass) the Final Target Score will win the NBA All-Star Game. How is the Final Target Score determined?  The Final Target Score will be determined by taking the leading team\u2019s total cumulative score through three quarters and adding 24 points. What is an example of the Final Target Score? Below is a review of how the Final Target Score worked when it was used in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. Team Giannis scored 41, 51 and 41 points in the first three quarters for a total cumulative score of 133 points. Team LeBron scored 53, 30 and 41 points in the first three quarters for a total cumulative score of 124 points. Through three quarters, the score was: Team Giannis 133, Team LeBron 124. As a result, the Final Target Score was set at 157 points (leading team\u2019s cumulative score of 133 + 24). At the start of the fourth quarter, here were the scenarios for how each team could win the NBA All-Star Game: Team LeBron reached the Final Target Score first and defeated Team Giannis 157-155. Team LeBron outscored Team Giannis 33-22 in the fourth quarter. Why use 24 points to help determine the Final Target Score?  For the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, the league incorporated 24 points into the calculation of the Final Target Score to honor the late Kobe Bryant, who wore No. 24 for the final 10 seasons of his career. The same method for determining the Final Target Score will be used for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game. How will the All-Star teams be selected? The rosters for the NBA All-Star Game will be determined through the NBA All-Star Draft, where the two team captains will select from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference and make their picks without regard to conference affiliation. The captains will be the All-Star starter from each conference who receives the most fan votes in his conference.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. The Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors meet for the second time in three days on Thursday ( 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), both struggling to match their success of last season, when they finished first and second in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors have seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in winning percentage and are just four losses from matching their total from last season (19). The Bucks have seen the fourth biggest drop in winning percentage and are just five losses away from last season\u2019s total (17). The Bucks\u2019 and Raptors\u2019 drop-offs have come in similar fashion. After ranking first and second in defensive efficiency last season, they rank 13th and 16th this season, having seen the two biggest jumps in points allowed per 100 possessions. Biggest jump, points allowed per 100 possessions The Bucks have seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in defensive rebounding percentage , while the Raptors have seen its third biggest jump in opponent free throw rate . But the most important thing on both ends of the floor is shooting, and these two teams have seen the two biggest jumps in opponent effective field goal percentage . The biggest aspect of those top two defenses last season was rim protection. The Bucks allowed their opponents to take just 26% of their shots in the restricted area, the league\u2019s lowest opponent rate by a healthy margin. The Raptors had the fifth lowest rate (30%). Both teams sold out to prevent shots at the basket, yielding a high volume of 3-point attempts as a result. And over the course of a full season, the math worked out for them. This season, the Bucks and Raptors rank fourth and sixth in the (lowest) percentage of their shots that have come in the restricted. The Bucks have only seen a small increase, while the Raptors have seen a drop. But they rank lower because the league-wide rate has seen a big drop, from 32.2% last season to just 30.2% this season. With that, restricted area defense, both the prevention of shots near the rim and defending those shots well, hasn\u2019t been as important this season as it was in each of the last two seasons. In fact, while there was a strong correlation between preventing restricted-area shots and defensive efficiency in each of the last two seasons (2018-19 and \u201919-20), there\u2019s a negative correlation this season. The team that has allowed the lowest percentage of opponent shots in the restricted area this season is the Washington Wizards, who rank 25th defensively . Three other teams that rank in the top 10 in (lowest) percentage of opponent shots coming in the restricted area \u2013 Brooklyn, Dallas and New Orleans \u2013 rank in the bottom five in defensive efficiency. Restricted-area shots remain the most valuable on the floor, worth 1.26 points per attempt, league-wide. But that\u2019s down a tick from last season (1.27), while shots from outside the restricted area \u2013 *other paint shots, mid-range shots and 3-pointers \u2013 have all seen increases in value with the league making them at a higher rate. * It\u2019s worth noting that while the percentage of shots coming in the restricted area has taken a pretty big drop, the percentage coming from elsewhere in the paint (along with the field goal percentage on those shots) have seen jumps. It\u2019s possible that some shots that were tracked as coming from the restricted-area bucket last season are being tracked as non-restricted-area shots this season. The Bucks, who have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in points scored per 100 possessions, are mixing up their defensive coverages a little bit more than they have in the past, perhaps to be more prepared for the postseason. The Raptors lost two important pieces of their championship core in the offseason. And when you rank first and second, there\u2019s nowhere to go but down. But the game is also evolving. And it may be possible that rim protection isn\u2019t as important as it was just a year ago. If you think that NBA offense is getting more ridiculous every week, you\u2019re right. Note that there have been * three games this season where both teams scored at least 130 points per 100 possessions, and all three have come in the last seven days. The second of those was Nets-Suns on Tuesday. * Three such games already ties the high for the most in any season in the 25 years for which we have play-by-play data. When you win a game in which you allowed 124 points on just 95 possessions, you\u2019ve won with offense. But the Nets kind of won with defense, too. They trailed by 24 points late in the second quarter and by 21 at the half, having allowed the Suns to score an incredible 75 points on 49 first-half possessions ( 153 per 100 ). And then they came all the way back, with James Harden hitting the go-ahead 3 with 30 seconds left and Landry Shamet forcing Devin Booker into a tough shot on the other end of the floor. The second of those two plays was obviously the more remarkable one. And in the second half, the Nets held the Suns to just 49 points on 46 possessions. They had been switching screens with everybody but DeAndre Jordan, and in that second half, they had Jordan switching screens, too . More important is that their switching execution was better. Here\u2019s one possession from the fourth quarter, where the Nets seamlessly switch an off-ball action between Chris Paul and Mikal Bridges, Shamet avoids a disaster after Bruce Brown switches onto Paul, and then Jeff Green switches the hand-off from Deandre Ayton to Booker, with Shamet getting to the basket side of Ayton to prevent a roll to the rim \u2026 A switch-everything scheme can flatten an offense out and keep it from gaining the advantages that it normally depends on to generate layups and open shots. Switching everything can also be less taxing, because there\u2019s no chasing ball-handlers or shooters around screens. But it takes great communication to execute it well. The year that Harden\u2019s Houston Rockets had a 3-2 series lead over the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals, their switching was near perfect. With the offense that they have, the Nets don\u2019t need to be that sharp. But should they continue to switch everything defensively, their ability to improve within that scheme and reduce breakdowns could be the thing to watch over the next few months. The next challenge for what is now the league\u2019s 26th-ranked defense is LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, who the Nets will visit in the fourth game of their five-game trip on Thursday ( 10 p.m. ET, TNT ). Against a switching defense (and without Anthony Davis), James will surely target who he deems to be the weakest defender by using screens set by the guy that defender is guarding. We\u2019ll see if Kawhi Leonard is available to do the same when the Nets play the Clippers on Sunday ( 8 p.m. ET, ESPN ). The \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cstack\u201d pick-and-roll is fairly popular around the league, seemingly run most by the Charlotte Hornets, Dallas Mavericks ( some examples ) and Phoenix Suns. It\u2019s usually a high pick-and-roll run from the top of the floor, with a third offensive player setting a back-screen on the guy defending the original screen-setter. The Suns are probably the most creative team with how they set up their Spain sets. On the first possession of the third quarter against the Sixers on Saturday, they disguised a Spain play with \u201cHorns\u201d look (two players at the elbows, two in the corners). Ayton set a cross-screen for Booker to flare to the left wing, Booker quickly handed the ball to Frank Kaminsky, and then circled into position for the back-screen as Kaminsky pitched the ball back to Paul \u2026 Paul then ran pick-and-roll with Ayton, and Booker set the additional screen on Joel Embiid. Ben Simmons (who was guarding Booker) stopped Paul\u2019s drive and Danny Green (who was guarding Paul) switched out to Booker, but Embiid, having been hit by Booker\u2019s screen, was a step late in recovering to Ayton\u2019s roll to the rim. Paul got Ayton the ball and Ayton waited out Embiid\u2019s fly-by \u2026 On a sideline out of bounds play in the fourth quarter, the Suns added an additional layer to the Spain set. It was another Paul\/Ayton pick-and-roll with Booker at the foul line, ready to set the back-screen on Embiid. But Booker flared out to the left wing early and Cam Johnson came from the baseline to set the back-screen. Simmons reacted really quickly to prevent Booker from shooting off the catch \u2026 Booker just hit a step-back instead. The Suns blew that 24-point lead to Brooklyn on Tuesday, but have still won nine of their last 11 games . They have a two-game, two-night trip this weekend, playing in New Orleans on Friday and Memphis on Saturday, with both games on League Pass. If you tune in, keep an eye out for the \u201cSpain\u201d set, with the knowledge that it might look like something else at first. Damian Lillard did it again. With 20 seconds left and the Portland Trail Blazers down one in New Orleans on Wednesday, Lillard rejected a screen, drove past Lonzo Ball, took a bump, and sunk a bit of a circus shot as he hit the floor. It was his fifth bucket to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime this season. That gave him the league lead (again), moving back ahead of Harden (Tuesday) and Malcolm Brogdon (just a few minutes earlier on Wednesday) having each made their fourth in the previous 24 hours. Most baskets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the 4th quarter or OT Zach LaVine has the most attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute, but is 2-for-10. Booker, James and Jayson Tatum are all 2-for-7. Paul and Bradley Beal, both 0-for-5, have the most attempts without a make. In his career (counting playoffs), Lillard is 58-for-150 (39%) on shots (from the field) to tie or take the lead in the fourth quarter or overtime. That 39% is much better than the league average (33%) over that time (since 2012-13) and those 58 buckets are 14 more than any other player over these last nine seasons. Next on the list are: 2. Russell Westbrook: 44-for-157 (28%) 3. LeBron James: 43-for-110 (39%) 4. DeMar DeRozan: 38-for-113 (34%) 5. James Harden: 36-for-111 (32%) Among 41 players with at least 50 attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime over the last nine seasons, Anthony Davis \u2013 31-for-60 (51%) \u2013 has shot the best, while Paul George \u2013 15-for-88 (17%) \u2013 has shot the worst. Playing without Embiid in Utah on Monday, the Sixers had a 24-10 lead midway through the first quarter. But that lead was gone by halftime. It was the Sixers\u2019 first loss (they were previously 15-0) after leading by double-digits and it left the San Antonio Spurs (13-0) as the only team that hasn\u2019t lost a game that it\u2019s led by 10 points or more. No team has a losing record in games it led by double-digits, though the Minnesota Timberwolves dropped to 5-5 with their loss to Indiana (after leading by 10 early in the fourth quarter) on Wednesday. With offensive efficiency at an all-time high, things may seem a little more wild this season. But league-wide winning percentage in games led by double-digits (0.764) is actually up from last season (0.757). Wildly, the Bucks are the only team that has not won a game it trailed by double-digits. Last season, they were 9-16 after trailing by double-digits. This season, they\u2019re 0-11. The Lakers (8-5) are the only team with a winning record in games they trailed by 10 points or more. Here are the records for all 30 teams in games they led and trailed by double-digits through Wednesday: Records after leading or trailing by double-digits * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He scored 50.3 FD points (6.3x value against this price). He has a shot to hit value again tonight, and since he\u2019ll also play in the slate\u2019s highest-scoring, fastest-paced game, he\u2019s hard to exclude from FanDuel lineups. Montrezl Harrell (C \u2013 LAC) vs. BKN $6,200 The Nets have been absolutely terrible against opposing centers this season. They give up the fourth-most FDPPG to the position \u2014 the second-highest on the slate. Harrell also is coming in hot after a 31.7 FD point performance (5.1x value) against the T\u2019Wolves. Tyler Herro (SG \u2013 MIA) at SAC $6,100 I absolutely love Herro here. The Miami Heat are on the wrong end of a back-to-back, and Herro double-doubled in that game. He scored 11 points, nabbed 15 rebounds, and posted 42 FD points (6.9x value). Look for him to keep building momentum here \u2014 especially as one of Miami\u2019s fresher players following the overtime loss. Oh, and the Kings give up the second-most FDPPG to shooting guards. Kyle Kuzma (PF \u2013 LAC) vs. BKN $5,800 With Anthony Davis now out for the foreseeable future, Kuzma remains a bit underpriced at FanDuel. The Nets give up the fourth-most FDPPG to power forwards, too, which should only help Kuzma hit value against this relatively low price point. Tyrese Haliburton (SG \u2013 SAC) vs. MIA $5,500 The Heat are the slate\u2019s third-worst team against shooting guards, as they give up the eighth-most FDPPG to the position. Haliburton should get a few extra minutes tonight with two starters out for the Kings, and it won\u2019t be hard for him to hit value, especially if this turns into a high-scoring contest. Marvin Bagley III (PF \u2013 SAC) vs. MIA $5,200 Bagley will get a lot of extra usage with fellow bigs Barnes and Holmes sidelined. He\u2019s considerably cheaper than Hassan Whiteside ($6,000) on this slate, too. Bagley dropped 30.4 FD points (5.8x value) against the Nets on Monday, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him hit value again. The Heat even give up the 10th-most FDPPG to power forwards. Nemanja Bjelica (PF- SAC) vs. MIA $4,600 Another bargain-bin big, Bjelica had a huge showing against the Magic last week with Bagley sidelined, but he hasn\u2019t done much since. That could change with both Barnes and Holmes out, and another 33.8 FD point (7.3x value) showing could be in the cards. Kelly Olynyk (C- MIA) at SAC $4,500 The Heat aren\u2019t pushing Olynyk very hard right now. He played just 23 minutes last night despite several of his teammates logging 40-plus, so his usage does cap his upside. That said, the Heat will be tired heading into this game, and the Kings won\u2019t have two of their starting bigs \u2014 and they were giving up the second-most FDPPG to centers with them around! Olynyk was scoring between 25 and 27 FDPPG just last week, and anything in that range would clear 5x value at this price. Pat Connaughton (PG- MIL) vs. TOR $4,200 The Bucks didn\u2019t have Jrue Holiday in their previous game against the Raptors, and his status remains uncertain for this game. Connaughton played 31 minutes without him on Tuesday, and he scored the second-most points for Milwaukee (20). He scored 35.5 FD points (8.5x value) in the process. He may not hit that ceiling again, but he\u2019s not a bad flier if Holiday sits again. Andre Iguodala (SG \u2013 MIA) at SAC $3,500 The 37-year-old veteran played only 20 minutes last night, and that makes him one of Miami\u2019s freshest players on this side of their back-to-back. The Kings give up the second-most FDPPG to shooting guards, and with Iguodala priced at the absolute minimum, he isn\u2019t a bad punt play tonight."},{"id":496494,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/acts-of-courage-is-what-leads-to-change","date":"2021-02-18","title":"Acts of courage \u2014 from many individuals \u2014 is what leads to change","content":"On Dec. 1, 1955, Rosa Parks sat on a Montgomery, Ala. bus and refused to give up her seat to a white man. It would become a moment that defined a movement, forever shaping the course of civil rights history in the United States with that simple gesture of bravery and defiance. Though she sat alone that day, Rosa Parks truly was never alone. Her strength was anchored in what drives human resiliency. Confronting fear and rising above ignorance is often triggered by an incident such as the one she faced. In this case, the cause was a segregationist system that she felt compelled to challenge. So Rosa Parks made a stand by sitting. The late civil rights icon John Lewis would say she was getting into \u201cgood trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d \u201cI had given up my seat before, but this day, I was especially tired,\u201d Mrs. Parks later explained. \u201cTired from my work as a seamstress, and tired from the ache in my heart.\u201d She based her decision on all she had experienced and all that she knew. She knew, for instance, of the brutal and heartless murder of teenager Emmett Till in Mississippi and the verdict freeing his killers only weeks earlier. She knew right from wrong. And she knew enough was enough. Through the lens of time, here is what we know: Rosa Parks was a beacon of courage and hope. While history paints a picture of a passive woman refusing to give up her bus seat, the truth is she was a lifelong civil rights activist before becoming the catalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. And if we look deeper, we understand she was never alone in her iconic act. The fact is, there are countless examples like Rosa\u2019s in communities across the country \u2013 little-known individuals whose acts of courage confronted and helped change the status quo of racial injustice and inequity. They may not be household names like Rosa Parks. But learning their stories and recognizing their contributions can enrich us as a nation during this critical moment of awakening in race relations and human rights. Eighteen years before Rosa changed history, for instance, Minnie Rogers was in the midst of creating change in Bradenton, Fla. During my NBA officiating career, I lived in that community and came to hear of her story. It began in 1937 when President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was rolling out with $4.9 billion to build new parks, bridges and schools \u2013 an astronomical amount of money in that era. Mrs. Rogers had a vision for the Manatee County 13th Avenue Community Center. She shared that vision with her friend, legendary educator Mary McLeod Bethune, whose name would one day grace the institution of higher learning she helped to found, Florida\u2019s Bethune-Cookman University. Together, hoping to further this idea, they met with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. But pause for a moment to think about that. In 1937, arranging a meeting with the First Lady was only one formidable hurdle in the process. How did they get to Washington D.C.? Today\u2019s mindset is to hop on a flight and arrive in the nation\u2019s capital in a matter of hours. But back then, such a trip required a train ride \u2013 not simply for two women but two \u201ccolored women\u201d traveling in separate train cars from white passengers. You can imagine how many kitchen-table meetings took place prior to that trip \u2013 and how many times she must have heard \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d or \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d Yet her unstoppable determination led to that meeting with Mrs. Roosevelt to gain support for her plan and helped propel her vision into a reality. She eventually opened the 13th Avenue Community Center, serving area children and families each year. While living in the Sarasota-Bradenton area, I would drive by the 13th Avenue Community Center and never knew of Minnie Rogers\u2019 influence. Like most things in life, until you become involved, you don\u2019t truly understand. I was recruited to become a member of the 13th Avenue Community Center board and it was then that I became educated and aware of its founder, Mrs. Rogers. It drove me to learn more about her leadership. I heard from those who knew her and how she would stop kids from playing with toy guns or pretend to hold guns with their hands \u2013 directing them to instead use their hands and minds to make a better community. She was not timid in using her voice and her love to benefit future generations. Leadership is an \u201cinfluence relationship.\u201d And the leadership that Minnie Rogers displayed served as one step in the civil rights march. That is why Rosa Parks was never alone. Both women were integral parts of a leadership movement that transformed communities and our world for the better. Today, the 13th Avenue Community Center is now known as the 13th Avenue Dream Center, where thousands of children and families are benefitted every year. New location. New facilities. Same servant leadership mission started by Minnie Rogers decades ago. Learning about our community leaders provides a better understanding of our community roots. Our history is rich with stories of such leaders, who stepped forward to enhance life for others. Here is another. The night before Veterans Day in 2013, former NBA great and U.S. Navy veteran David Robinson and I had spent time with a Navy SEAL team. The next morning, we were honored to be guests at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington Cemetery, with President Obama conducting a wreath-laying ceremony. During the president\u2019s speech, he introduced 106-year-old Richard Overton, who had served in the South Pacific and Iowa Jima and at the time was the oldest living World War II veteran. I listened to the president\u2019s words and thought of how Mr. Overton fought for his fellow soldiers, his country, for me \u2013 and for my family. It struck me that if I was living during that time, he and I would have not used the same restrooms or been able to drink from the same water fountains. Yet he fought for me. At the conclusion of the ceremony, David and I moved the fastest we had since running the NBA floors to meet this great American. We spoke and thanked him for his service and wanted to capture this moment with a photo. David snapped pictures as I shook Mr. Overton\u2019s hand and thanked him repeatedly for everything he had done for all of us and our country. It was probably too many \u201cthank yous\u201d in Mr. Overton\u2019s mind, because he tightened his grip, pulled me closer and said, with a wink and a smile, \u201cYou know, I can still do more.\u201d I often think of Mr. Overton, a man who at 106 years old, still saw opportunities to make a difference. He passed away six years later yet his leadership legacy lives on, connecting citizens who made an indelible impact on the world like Minnie Rogers and Rosa Parks. The fact is every community has individuals who reinforce the reality that Rosa was never alone when she changed the course of history. She may have been by herself, but so many others stood \u2014 or more accurately \u2014 sat with her in that pivotal moment. Their stories need to be told, too. Take the time to learn about everyday folks from your town, city or state who, like Rosa Parks, took action to make our communities a better place, and changed the world in the process. You will be enriched to learn about amazing women and men, many of whom may not be household names but who changed neighborhoods and lives forever. * * * Bob Delaney is a retired NBA referee and former Vice President NBA Referee Operations\/Director of Officials.

While showcasing his commentating skills, he compared second-year forward Jeff Green to an old uncle at the gym who would always punish opponents in the low post. The two barely knew each other at the time. Years later, however, their relationship has blossomed and so has that LeBron-given nickname \u201cuncle.\u201d It went from a joke about Green\u2019s on-court fundamentals to a true encapsulation of the veteran\u2019s presence in the locker room. He\u2019s the uncle you respect, the one who smiles often but means business, the one who checks in on you even if you\u2019re 730 miles away. That\u2019s the distance from Brooklyn to Indianapolis, which is the route Caris LeVert took after he was dealt in the James Harden trade. Hearing news that a small mass on LeVert\u2019s kidney was discovered during a team physical, Green delivered a text message to his former teammate, referencing his own tribulation years ago, as well as the comeback story that\u2019s still being written. Green stepped away from basketball in 2011 after a heart defect was discovered during a routine physical. He missed an entire season. Since then, Green has carved out an instrumental role on several NBA teams, including his current stint in Brooklyn. The 34-year-old is making half his shots and shooting a career-high 42.7% from deep on nearly 10 points per game. He\u2019s guarding multiple positions and providing productive minutes down the stretch of a championship contender. If it\u2019s not the Nets\u2019 Big Three hitting clutch shots, it\u2019s likely Green . So, he\u2019s come a long way since having heart surgery nine years ago and expects LeVert to bounce back and eventually become an All-Star. As for LeVert\u2019s reply to Green\u2019s encouraging text: \u201cAppreciate that Unc.\u201d Jeff Green also spoke with NBA.com about playing with LeBron, reuniting with Kevin Durant, the Nets\u2019 defensive woes, HBCUs and his \u201cwelcome to the NBA\u201d moment from Kobe Bryant.  Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited. NBA.com: Describe what it takes to stay in this league for 10+ years as a player who isn\u2019t considered a superstar, but does their job really well? Green: Dedication, loving the game, loving the process of the game and journey. The everyday grind, falling in love with that. That\u2019s what it\u2019s been for me. I realize I\u2019ve been with a lot of teams, but deep down the hard work and passion for the game and what I put into it has kept me around. I\u2019m thankful for that and all the opportunities that have been given. My job is just continue day in and day out to keep myself in the gym, stay well prepared and just do my part whenever my name is called. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s been 14 years and 13 years playing. I\u2019m very thankful for every opportunity. It gives me a lot of excitement everyday to know that I\u2019m able to play this game at a high level with all that I\u2019ve been through. Speaking of things you\u2019ve been through, I\u2019d like to hear your perspective on Caris LeVert. It was a somewhat similar tribulation. You had your heart surgery in 2012 after a routine physical exam revealed the condition. LeVert had a physical and MRI after being traded this season, then discovered he needed to have surgery for kidney cancer. Did you reach out to him after the news? I\u2019ve talked to CL a lot through text, just letting him know I\u2019m here for him and if there\u2019s anything he needs. There\u2019s only so much I can do from afar, but for me, knowing what I went through, it\u2019s important just having somebody to speak to or just reach out and know that somebody has my back, and that\u2019s exactly what I did for him. Once I found out, five minutes later I sent him a text letting him know you have to embrace the challenge, knowing that it\u2019s a blessing in disguise. Yeah, he acknowledged the trade possibly could have saved him. It\u2019s bigger than basketball. Basketball will always be there. He\u2019s a young kid, a future All-Star of this league in my eyes. I told him to look at it as a blessing in disguise. Be thankful, keep your faith strong and look at this with a positive lens knowing that your health is more important than this basketball game. Hopefully those words helped him out. We got a chance to see him when we played in Indiana last week, and it was good to see him. He was in good spirits. When I was with him in Brooklyn, I was always talking to him just to see how he was doing on a personal level. He\u2019s a good kid, and for me, it was just about telling him that I got his back, and I\u2019m in his corner if there\u2019s anything he needs along the process of recovering. Did you expect to be playing this big a role in Brooklyn when you joined? I can\u2019t say I expected the role, but with hard work, the experience that I have and being able to play multiple positions, I knew with that combo that I\u2019d hopefully be having a role. But I never came in with an expectation. My job and mindset was to work as hard as I could to put myself in the position where coach is going to trust me enough to put me on the floor. That\u2019s what I always come in with. I always come in with the mentality that I have to work for everything and earn my spot and my minutes. I was reading an old article from Sekou Smith, who we admired here at NBA.com, and he labeled you as \u201ca 6-foot-9, 235-pound forward with the length and athleticism to match up against power forwards and the range and ballhandling skills to work on the perimeter.\u201d That was written in 2012, but seems like that applies to you today. You\u2019re guarding opposing bigs and shooting about 43% from deep. Speak to your game at 34. First off, RIP to Mr. Smith. I never got a chance to have a conversation with him, but watched his work on NBA TV and throughout his career. Prayers go out to his family. As far as the percentages and everything, I just put in the work, and I trust the work. I go out and I play with joy. I have fun with the game, and I do whatever it takes to help my team win. I just enjoy it all man. There\u2019s no other way to put it; it\u2019s just the love and the passion that I have for this game. I\u2019m naturally motivated. I motivate myself to be better everyday whether that\u2019s being a basketball player, a husband and a father. As a player who\u2019s lived in so many different cities and been traded during the season before, what\u2019s that been like from a personal and family standpoint?  I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s been amazing to experience our nation as much as I have. But for me, I have the best wife in the world. She makes everything easy for me, making sure our kids are squared away with school and what they need, making sure that I have everything that I need. I have to sacrifice a lot. I have to sacrifice a lot of time and she just makes life easy. Without her, none of this would be possible. She allows me to be stress free. She allows me to go out and do what I love as my number one fan. Without my wife, none of this would be possible. She makes every transition easy for me. Virtually every team in the NBA that has won a championship in the last 10 years had a top 10 defense. The Warriors were 11th one year, but had the best defense in the postseason. Do you think you all can get to that level? I definitely think we can get to that level. There\u2019s not a doubt in my mind that we can. I\u2019m certain we will be, and if not, we\u2019ll be close. I don\u2019t live in the past as far as what other teams have done because of personnel changes year in and year out, and the game changes. I\u2019m not saying that with our offensive talent that\u2019s going to automatically put us in The Finals and have us winning. We do have to play defense, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m confident in what we have regardless of where we rank in defense. People are going to find the flaw, and there are flaws in every team in this league. Defense just happens to be ours. I look at it like at the end of the day, we get questioned about our defense, but we\u2019re second or third in the Eastern Conference standings, and that\u2019s pretty good still. I think we\u2019ll be OK when the time comes and it\u2019s time to battle for that championship. What has been the best part of reuniting with former Seattle\/OKC teammate Kevin Durant, and did you call him when you started looking at Brooklyn in free agency? Yeah, me and KD talked on the phone before I signed. But honestly, most of it is not about basketball. I rarely talk basketball when it\u2019s with my close people. It\u2019s mainly about life. I love seeing where Kevin\u2019s at in his life. I love seeing what James has done in his life. Obviously on the basketball side I\u2019ve been a fan of what they\u2019ve done, looking from afar and supporting them. I love seeing what they\u2019ve both done. But it\u2019s more about seeing our growth as men. I was 20 when we came in, KD was 18 and James got with us when he was 20. So we were all young kids. It\u2019s amazing to see where we\u2019re at now, all of us 30 plus, and how we\u2019ve grown as men and matured mentally. It\u2019s a blessing that we\u2019ve reunited and are battling as brothers again to get that championship. That just makes it more special. It\u2019s January 14th, 2008. Overtime in Seattle. Less than 10 seconds left. Kobe Bryant has the ball in his hand , what are you thinking at this moment? (Laughs). That was one of my \u2018welcome to the NBA\u2019 moments, man. It was like one of those surreal movie scenes where you just feel every person\u2019s energy and emotion in the arena. I just remember him bringing the ball up, trying to get the game-winning shot. I think I wrote in an Instagram post that I literally felt every fan stand up and start cheering when he had the ball. I felt like all the lights went out, and it was just us two. It was just like mano a mano. Like alright, this young rookie against the legend Kobe Bryant, I got to go for the stop. Obviously it did not happen, but it was that surreal moment like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m guarding Kobe Bryant on the iso for the game.\u2019 It was definitely an experience man. Rest in peace to the legend. It was that welcome to the NBA moment where I\u2019m thinking, \u2018You\u2019re here, you\u2019re here, try to make something happen.\u2019 We didn\u2019t get it done, but it was a wonderful experience, something that I\u2019ll never ever forget. Do you recall him saying anything to you during or after the game? Nah, I just remember I used to leave with welts on my arm. He was a physical cat man. It was definitely a challenge every time I went against him. You had to be ready mentally and physically when you go against a guy like that, and he got the best of me a lot of those nights. I\u2019m just thankful I was able to share the court with him. He was a beast. Do you have a favorite memory playing against your coach Steve Nash? Yeah, I do. It was actually my very first NBA game. We played preseason in Vancouver, Canada my rookie year. I knew of Steve Nash, but I never knew of his presence, especially in Canada. I can\u2019t recall the arena we played in, but every seat was filled. When he ran out, everybody stood up and gave this man the loudest ovation I\u2019ve ever heard. That was the first time we played against him and Amar\u2019e (Stoudemire). And I\u2019m not going to lie, that\u2019s who I wanted to get drafted to. Really, why was that? It was based on how they play, going up and down, the fast-pace offense they ran back then. It was something I wanted to be a part of, but I didn\u2019t get that chance. I got the chance to see it up close (against them). Amar\u2019e was somebody I saw play when he was in high school. I was a big, big fan of Amar\u2019e. Then to see Steve\u2019s presence in my first game was remarkable. It was insane. I read where Nash said people aren\u2019t feeling the chess tournaments he\u2019s proposed as a way to bond. How have you all been able to get closer as a team on this road trip?  It\u2019s kind of difficult being on the West coast because of the strict (COVID-19) rules and not being able to be in the same place as a group. It\u2019s put some handcuffs on those missions, but we\u2019re making it as best as possible. Being around each other on the floor, being able to communicate, that\u2019s our way of building that chemistry. Being in the locker room during games. We\u2019re just trying to find ways to be around each other more and more. We\u2019re making the best of it, trying to stay within the protocols of what COVID has given us. It\u2019s been good. You\u2019re facing two former teammates and future Hall of Famers this week in Chris Paul and LeBron James. First, how would you describe Paul\u2019s legacy right now and what was it like playing with him? Chris is a true leader, somebody I respect a lot. Somebody who\u2019s done great things in this game for a while. His leadership experience has trickled down to SGA (Shai Gigelous-Alexander) in OKC and all the teammates he had while we were in LA. He\u2019s a guy who demands greatness and brings it on the court every night. You can\u2019t say enough about what he\u2019s done for this game as far as being a floor general and what\u2019s he\u2019s done for other guys he\u2019s played with. I was thankful to play with him. And LeBron? He\u2019s a guy that a lot of the younger generation is going to mimic their game after by being able to do EVERYTHING . Make sure you put that in all-caps and bold. He can do everything on the court. He\u2019s a guy who I learned a lot from in our year in Cleveland together as far as mentally and physically preparing for games. The longevity. You see what he\u2019s doing, the way he\u2019s still flying around. It\u2019s inspirational. Seeing how he\u2019s demanding greatness night in and night out in his 18th year. Pushing through this year with the Lakers has been fun to watch. I\u2019m definitely a fan. He\u2019s definitely a good friend. I\u2019ve been enjoying watching him these last couple years. One thing I remember about those Cleveland days was the ton of handshakes LeBron and the team would do together. How did y\u2019all keep up with that? Look I\u2019m going to tell you this. I only had one handshake and that was with (LeBron). All the other guys got the business handshake. I wasn\u2019t about to remember 15 other handshakes (laughs). It was one I had with him, we had the Wakanda one. I don\u2019t know how he does it every year with everyone. You grew up in the DMV, not too far from Howard University. Do you see a path of more college recruits attending HBCUs? I hope so. I just want kids to realize that you don\u2019t necessarily have to go to a big school to get looks or be viewed as a good player. I think that\u2019s just the stereotype of what can get you to the NBA. If you\u2019re a good player, you\u2019re going to get recognized regardless of where you\u2019re at. When kids start taking a chance and not just following the norm, then it will happen. I talked to Makur Maker when he signed (at Howard). I sent him a DM and said, \u2018Thank you. Keep creating change for the younger generation.\u2019 I told him, \u2018I still have people in D.C. My people will be there supporting you, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that. The city is going to be there.\u2019 Obviously, the pandemic hit, but I told him he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the fan aspect and support because it\u2019s going to be there. D.C. is always going to want to root for the underdog. They want to root for greatness and in his position he\u2019s going to get that support. I do hope that kids will start taking that chance of venturing out to HBCUs and making these colleges known. I think it\u2019s in the making. How much longer do you hope to play in the NBA? Honestly, that\u2019s not my decision. It\u2019s in God\u2019s hands. I\u2019m a guy who goes year-to-year and plays as long as teams will want me. I really, really love the game. I\u2019m passionate about this game and what I can bring to it. One thing I did was always look at this: I went to Georgetown. And we\u2019ve had some great Hall of Famers come out of Georgetown. Allen Iverson, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing. So when I was young at Georgetown, I looked at how many years they played. Given what Zo went through with the kidney (transplant) and bouncing back to play 15-plus years. Dikembe 15-plus. That\u2019s inspiration for me. It\u2019s always been my goal to try to be a guy who came out of Georgetown just like those guys, to go to the NBA and play that same amount (of years). God has put me in a position where now I\u2019m in year 14 and still able to play at a high level. So how many more? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to play until the wheels fall off."},{"id":495845,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-love-takes-part-in-practice-nears-return-from-injury","date":"2021-02-17","title":"Kevin Love takes part in practice, nears return from injury","content":"CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Kevin Love took part in most of the Cavaliers\u2019 practice Wednesday, moving the five-time All-Star closer to playing after missing most of the season with a calf injury. Love has been out since Dec. 27, when he aggravated a calf strain he initially incurred in the team\u2019s exhibition opener. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Love was able to do \u201cquite a bit of the live stuff\u201d during the workout as the Cavs, who have lost eight straight, got in a previously unscheduled practice after Wednesday\u2019s game against San Antonio was postponed because of a COVID-19 outbreak among the Spurs. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Bickerstaff said of the latest step in Love\u2019s slow improvement. \u201cObviously you wait and see how he responds tomorrow, but he\u2019s making progress and he was with us for most of the day.\u201d The Cavs host the Denver Nuggets on Friday, a matchup arranged by the NBA after the game against the Spurs was scrapped. Love\u2019s return would provide a major boost for the Cavs, who have dropped 10 of 11 and are now enveloped in a strange situation with center Andre Drummond. The team has decided not to play Drummond while trying to trade the two-time All-Star, who is in the final year of his contract and not part of Cleveland\u2019s long-term plans. The 27-year-old Drummond was on the bench and cheered on his teammates during Monday night\u2019s loss at Golden State. However, Bickerstaff said Drummond was not with the team Wednesday and the Cavs are still discussing if he will stay around while trade talks proceed. The Cavs\u2019 decision to keep Drummond off the floor drew some criticism, particularly from outspoken Warriors forward Draymond Green. Following Monday\u2019s game, Green said a double standard exists in the NBA in terms of players and trades. During his unprompted remarks, Green said players are unfairly labeled as selfish if they ask to be traded while teams can do as they please. Bickerstaff was aware of Green\u2019s comments but avoided saying he disagreed with them. \u201cNobody\u2019s opinion should be muted,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously there\u2019s conversations that we\u2019ve had with our guys as far as this process goes that everybody\u2019s not privy to. But again, guys have a right to speak their voice and organizations have to do what\u2019s best for the organization. I think that\u2019s kind of how it works and it shouldn\u2019t be a two-way street, so to speak.\u201d Bickerstaff again praised Drummond\u2019s professionalism \u201cin difficult circumstances.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been great,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cHe was in the locker room at halftime having conversations with the guys about what he saw on the floor. He was there after the game. He\u2019s been tremendous through this whole thing and it\u2019s not easy.\u201d The Cavs will continue to provide whatever resources Drummond needs, Bickerstaff said. There\u2019s always a concern Drummond\u2019s awkward ordeal could have a negative impact on a young team like Cleveland\u2019s. However, Bickerstaff remains confident the Cavs are committed and can move forward without too much disruption. \u201cThis is not an easy situation and anybody who says it is would be being dishonest,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cIt goes back to how we treat each other period as human beings and not just as pieces on a puzzle board. So we have to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing by him as well.\u201d As the Cavs watch it all unfold, guard Collin Sexton said Drummond has the support of his teammates. Sexton, though, would not say if Drummond was being treated fairly. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on the season,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s still our guy. I don\u2019t know anything that\u2019s going on in between him and the front office. But I just know that if Andre steps on that court tomorrow with us, we\u2019re gonna go out there and battle with him. \u201cAnd whatever happens in the summer, we\u2019re gonna go work out with him in the summer. It\u2019s going to be that friendship, that relationship that we\u2019re just gonna continue to build and grow. But whatever they have in the front office with him and coach that doesn\u2019t pertain to me.\u201d"},{"id":495834,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-players-tested-positive-in-latest-covid-19-test-results","date":"2021-02-17","title":"5 players tested positive in latest COVID-19 results","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Of the 454 players tested for COVID-19 since Feb. 10, five new players have returned confirmed positive tests.

The Sixers average 7.3 more points at home (118.4) than they do on the road (111.1); they attempt six more 3-pointers per game and shoot nearly three percentage points better at home (37.3%). \u2022 Ben Simmons is coming off a career-high 42 points in Philadelphia\u2019s 134-123 loss to the red-hot Utah Jazz. Simmons shot 15-26 from the field with only one field goal attempt coming from outside the paint. It was the first 40-point game in the NBA without a 3-point attempt in over a year, when Russell Westbrook had 45 points in a Houston win against Minnesota on Jan. 24, 2020. \u2022 The Rockets dropped their sixth straight game on Monday, as the Wizards spoiled John Wall\u2019s return to D.C. with a 131-119 win. Wall posted season highs of 29 points and 11 assists in the loss to his former team. It was Wall\u2019s first double-double since Dec. 19, 2018 when his Wizards fell to the Rockets. \u2022 Joel Embiid was a last-minute scratch prior to Monday\u2019s loss to Utah. It was the sixth game of the season that Embiid has missed; the Sixers are 1-5 in his absence. The Sixers have been 16.5 points per 100 possessions better with Embiid on court (plus-10.8 net rating in 711 minutes) than when he\u2019s off court (minus-5.7 net rating in 638 minutes). Embiid has scored at least 25 points in 13 straight games \u2014 the second-longest active streak in the league behind Luka Doncic\u2019s 14. \u2022 The Sixers average the third-most turnovers per game in the league (15.6) \u2014 a mark that nearly matches the opponent turnovers that Houston\u2019s defense forces (15.3), which is the sixth-highest mark in the league. The Rockets have taken advantage of their opponents\u2019 miscues as they rank fourth in points off turnovers (19.1 per game).  10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Stephen Curry ranks second in the league in scoring at 30.1 ppg. His scoring average has steadily climbed this season, from 26.5 ppg in December (four games), 28.0 in January (16 games) and now 34.2 in February (eight games). In February, Curry is shooting 58.3% overall, 49.5% on 3-pointers and 95.6% from the free throw line. His 77.2 true shooting percentage ranks first among the top 230 players in field goals attempted. \u2022 The Heat (66.7%) and Warriors (66.3%) rank second and fourth, respectively, in assist percentage this season. The Warriors lead all teams with 4.4 secondary assists (a.k.a. hockey assists) and rank fourth in points created by assists (69.6). The Heat rank 28th in secondary assists (2.1) and 10th in points created by assists (67.4). \u2022 This game marks the fourth of a seven-game Western Conference road trip for the Heat \u2014 their longest trip of the first half of the season. After beginning with a win in Houston, the Heat lost to Utah and the LA Clippers to fall to 4-9 on the road this season. Miami is shooting just 31.9% from 3-point range on the road (29th in NBA), compared to 38.4% at home (fourth in NBA). \u2022 Draymond Green ranks sixth in the NBA in assists (8.3 apg). After averaging 6.6 assists over 16 games in January, Green\u2019s assists have jumped to 11.6 through the first eight games of February. Green trails only James Harden (11.8 apg) for the highest assist average of the month. While Green is scoring only 6.0 ppg in February, he is creating 29.1 ppg with his assists. \u2022 Jimmy Butler posted his second triple-double (30 pts, 10 reb, 10 ast) of the season (and of the week) in Miami\u2019s loss to the Clippers on Sunday. Between the regular season and playoffs, the Heat had been 6-0 when Butler posted a triple-double before Sunday\u2019s loss.

Probably not, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not an attractive play against the Bulls. Wendell Carter Jr. is back, but the Bulls are third in pace and don\u2019t play a lick of defense. Plumlee is averaging 45.1 FD points in his last three, and he\u2019ll be a nice option if you don\u2019t want to pay up for some of the elite centers. Lou Williams (SG \u2013 LAC) : $6,800 vs. UTA Sweet Lou has been terrific with Paul George out of the lineup, posting a crazy 38.9 FD points in his last five games. Williams should be the second option for the Clippers, assuming Kawhi Leonard (questionable) decides to suit up. If he doesn\u2019t, look for him to put up at least 20 shot attempts and be the main distributor like he\u2019s been in the previous two contests \u2013 where\u2019s he\u2019s delivered 20+ points and 10 assists. Kyle Anderson (SF \u2013 MEM) : $6,500 vs. OKC Recommending Anderson is never a sexy play, but numbers don\u2019t lie. He\u2019s put up an average of 35.5 FD points over his last five contests, and I love the matchup against the Thunder. Memphis is also playing on a back-to-back set and with Ja Morant\u2019s minutes finally creeping over 30 min, Anderson may be leaned on to generate some offense. He offers solid mid-tier value, averaging 5.5x value in his past five games. Darius Bazley (PF \u2013 OKC) : $6,100 at MEM He\u2019s playing over 36 minutes per contest over his last five, and with the Thunder on the tail end of a back-to-back, there\u2019s a good chance that Al Horford rests or plays fewer minutes against the Grizzlies. Bazley\u2019s scored over 34 FD points in his past two and delivered 5x value in his last five. Give the third-year pro a look as he can contribute across all categories. Anthony Edwards (SG \u2013 MIN) : $6,000 vs. PHI The number one overall pick of the 2020 NBA Draft is fresh off setting a new career-high against the Lakers with 28 points, seven boards, and five assists. He was one of the studs of Tuesday\u2019s slate with 49.9 FD points, and over the last six games, Edwards is averaging 20 points per contest and seeing over 32 minutes per game. With DLo out, Edwards is a steal at this price point. Hamidou Diallo (PG \u2013 OKC) : $5,900 at MEM Diallo is taking full advantage of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s absence and continues to stuff the stat sheet nightly. He\u2019s averaging 14.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.0 assists over his last four games and finds himself in a good matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. He\u2019s scored at least 28 FD points in his last eight contests and has the ceiling of over 36 points tonight. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (PF \u2013 HOU) : $5,800 at PHI The injuries continue to mount for the Rockets, and with Oladipo, Gordon and Wood all likely sitting out, Tate will likely see 30+ minutes yet again. Though he is really a shooting guard who is versatile enough to play multiple positions, continue to exploit his eligibility at power forward. He\u2019s averaging 13.8 points and 5.6 rebounds while shooting 61.2 percent from the field across 33 minutes in his last five games. Josh Hart (SF \u2013 NOP) : $4,700 vs. NOP I typically don\u2019t recommend players on the back-end of a back-to-back set, but Josh Hart has played great off the bench for the Pelicans as of late. He\u2019s averaging 30.5 min and 30.4 FP in his last five contests, a shade under a fantasy-point-per-minute. He dropped 27 points with nine rebounds, two assists, and six triples in a blowout last night and has a tasty matchup versus a Portland defense that ranks in the bottom-three defensively. Michael Carter-Williams (PG \u2013 ORL) : $4,400 vs. NYK With news of Cole Anthony being out until the All-Star break, MCW becomes fantasy relevant once again. He has no competition for minutes, and with Evan Fournier still dealing with back spasms, Carter-Williams is a bargain in a matchup versus the Knicks. He\u2019s played an average of 28 minutes in his past two, but expect that to rise \u2013 along with his production. He scored 36.9 FD points one game ago, so his ceiling is right within that range. Tomas Satoransky (PG \u2013 CHI) : $4,100 vs. DET The veteran backup PG is steadily grinding his way into the Bulls rotation and producing in limited minutes. He\u2019s only seeing 22 minutes of action over his last five, but the results are undeniable. He\u2019s averaged 25.6 FD points in his last five, with 28.4 in his past two contests. He\u2019s a cheap option that\u2019s been returning 6x value as of late, worthy of consideration for tonight\u2019s large slate."},{"id":495766,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/isaiah-thomas-hopes-usa-basketball-stint-leads-to-call-from-nba","date":"2021-02-17","title":"Isaiah Thomas hopes USA Basketball stint leads to call from NBA","content":"(AP) \u2014 There was a day last spring when Isaiah Thomas noticed he could lift his leg without any pain. That hadn\u2019t happened in years. This weekend, he plans to show the NBA what that means for his game. More than a year removed from his last NBA appearance, and nine months after surgery that he says fixed a bone-on-bone condition in his right hip, Thomas has games to play. The two-time All-Star is suiting up with USA Basketball for a pair of FIBA AmeriCup qualifying games in San Juan, Puerto Rico \u2014 and Thomas expects NBA teams to be watching. \u201cMy ultimate goal is to play in the NBA as soon as possible,\u201d Thomas, 32, told The Associated Press. \u201cThis allows me to compete against other professionals, represent my country at the same time \u2014 which is an honor and a privilege \u2014 and ultimately show NBA teams that I\u2019m back to myself and I\u2019m 100% healthy. That\u2019s why I chose to come here. When Team USA brought it to me, it was a no-brainer.\u201d The games technically don\u2019t mean much to the U.S.; the Americans already have qualified for the AmeriCup tournament that will take place in September 2022. But to Thomas, the matchups against the Bahamas on Friday and Mexico on Saturday mean plenty. \u201cMy skill didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe biggest question was whether I am 100% healthy. I am now, so why not show it on a stage with \u2018USA\u2019 across your chest?\u201d Thomas is part of a U.S. roster loaded with NBA veterans for these two qualifying games. Joe Johnson is on the team, as is Brandon Bass, and there are five more players besides Thomas with some degree of experience within the league. Typically, U.S. rosters for these qualifying games are almost entirely composed of G League players, names that aren\u2019t exactly of the household variety. The NBA names add tons of intrigue, as does Thomas\u2019 return to game action. \u201cIsaiah, he\u2019s got a spirit about him, a love for the game that I\u2019ve seen not only from the conversations that I had with him before we arrived, but even since we\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d said Joe Prunty, who will lead the U.S. coaching staff in these two games. \u201cHe has looked good.\u201d Johnson \u2014 the 39-year-old who scored 20,405 points in his 17 NBA seasons \u2014 offered even more praise after seeing Thomas in practices this week. \u201cHe looks great,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ll say: In pick and rolls, I think he\u2019s probably going to be unstoppable. Bigs, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do. Do you get out and hedge? He\u2019ll go around you and split you. Do you try to catch him? He\u2019ll pull up for the jumper. He has a great arsenal. It\u2019s been fun to watch him play, man. I will tell you that.\u201d Thomas last played on Feb. 3, 2020, for Washington. He was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers three days later, then waived, and hasn\u2019t appeared in an NBA game since. The hip surgery \u2014 resurfacing, it\u2019s called \u2014 was performed three months later, and Thomas said the hip felt better immediately. So now, he\u2019s plotting another way to defy the odds. He was the No. 60, and last, pick in the 2011 draft. The other 73 final picks \u2014 granted, the draft used to include more than 200 players \u2014 have combined to score 6,644 points, while Thomas\u2019 NBA total is 9,508. He heard plenty of times that at 5-foot-9 he was too short for the NBA; he averaged 28.9 points for Boston in 2016-17, the most ever in league history for someone his height. \u201cI\u2019ve already proven who I am,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI still love the game. I just need an opportunity.\u201d The 2017 season is when four years of pain, both physical and personal, started. On the eve of the Celtics\u2019 playoff opener, sister Chyna died in a car crash. Thomas played on, scoring 53 points in a second-round game on what would have been his sister\u2019s 23rd birthday. But the hip issues already had started, and Thomas was shut down later that postseason. That summer, he was traded to Cleveland for Kyrie Irving. Nothing has been the same since; he\u2019s appeared in only 84 games, averaging 12.8 points. G League teams talked to him about playing this season; that was never a serious consideration for Thomas. When USA Basketball called, he leaped at the chance. \u201cI\u2019m as good now as I\u2019ve been in any point in the last three years,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cPlaying for USA Basketball is going to allow teams to see the way that I\u2019m moving, the way that I\u2019m playing, that I am back to myself, back to being the player that everyone is accustomed to seeing. I have strong belief that after they see me this weekend, somebody is going to pull the trigger and give me that opportunity \u2014 and I\u2019m going to be more than ready for it.\u201d"},{"id":495727,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-rookie-ladder-feb-17-edition","date":"2021-02-17","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Saddiq Bey surges into Top 10; Anthony Edwards climbs to No. 2","content":"Saddiq Bey ranks seventh on the Detroit Pistons in points per game, seventh in rebounds and ninth in field-goal percentage, while averaging fewer than 20 minutes nightly. That didn\u2019t stop him from bubbling up in a very hot week to snag an award \u2013 Eastern Conference Player of the Week \u2013 not just earmarked for rookies. The 6-foot-7 wing from Villanova did it by averaging 17.8 points and 5.5 rebounds in four games from Feb. 8-14, hitting 71.4% of his shots overall and 69.6% of his 3-pointers. And to be entirely honest, the three games in which Bey went for 15, 10 and 16 points while grabbing 10 rebounds and making 15 of 23 shots didn\u2019t earn him the accolade that former great Pistons such as Isiah Thomas and Grant Hill never earned as rookies. But oh, that fourth game. In Detroit\u2019s victory at Boston Friday, Bey hit all seven of his shots from the arc to set an NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers without a miss. He scored 30 points, had 12 rebounds and saved his last three until 38 seconds remained, pushing his team\u2019s lead from three to six points. We won\u2019t get into a debate here about Bey winning the weekly honor over Charlotte guard Terry Rozier, who averaged 30.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting 56.3% overall and making half his 3-pointers. This, after all, is the Kia Rookie Ladder, a space dedicated to the newcomers. The Pistons, naturally, have plans for Bey and fellow rookie Isaiah Stewart extending well beyond this season. Both are eminently coachable, with Stewart grinding inside for Detroit while Bey fills a 3-and-D role with some perimeter interchangeability at both ends. Their work so far and promise for the future are big reasons why forward Blake Griffin, a five-time all-NBA selection, is being shopped at age 31 . Said coach Dwane Casey of Bey: \u201cHe\u2019s still scratching the surface.\u201d The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Feb. 15) Season stats : 14.6 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 6.1 apg  Since last Ladder: 18.0 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 5.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 So Ball recently picked his all-time dream NBA starting lineup as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and \u2026 wait for it \u2026 himself. Please keep in mind this is Ball\u2019s dream, not his Mt. Rushmore or GOAT starting five. Who\u2019s to say those legends wouldn\u2019t enjoy playing with the kid, whose exuberance and creativity keep him atop this week\u2019s Ladder as much as his production. Plenty of work to do on defense, but that isn\u2019t slowing Ball\u2019s roll as a Rookie of the Year favorite. Season stats : 14.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.2 apg  Since last Ladder: 16.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 2.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 His stats against the Lakers Tuesday \u2013 28 points, 10 in the fourth \u2013 aren\u2019t included above but are worth noting as Edwards\u2019 role and confidence soar. Next challenge: Improve on-court chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns, who\u2019s back, now that guard D\u2019Angelo Russell ( left knee surgery ) is lost for weeks. His usage rate is up to 24.4 (third among rotation rookies) and as a starter Edwards had amassed 32 assists to nine turnovers.

One area in which the sleeper pick so far of the 2020 Draft knows he needs to improve is his strength. Not to bulk up or become a specimen necessarily, but to handle this league\u2019s day-to-day rigors. \u201cWhen I got to college it was like, \u2018Wow, these guys have grown man bodies.\u2019 But when you get to the NBA, they are grown men,\u201d the Sacramento newbie said on air, guesting Saturday during an Iowa State telecast.

The New York guard has teamed with Rose, continuing his development and offensive impact. His 26.5 usage rate tops rookies playing at least 15.0 minutes with 15 or more appearances. He averaged 21.5 minutes in the four games between Ladders, posting a plus-12.0 in plus\/minus. Season stats : 9.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 14.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 2.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 9 Tate hasn\u2019t just pushed into the top ranks of rookies statistically or on the Ladder \u2013 he ranks among the Rockets\u2019 leaders in shooting, effective field-goal percentage and offensive rebounds. And on a squad with P.J. Tucker, the 25-year-old small forward is getting attention for his defensive prowess. Few folks at Ohio State or in Belgium or Australia saw this sort of NBA success coming. 6.

Dominating inside while hitting a sizzling 13-for-16 from the field, Williamson became the only player in league history (during the shot-clock era) to average 23 points or more on 60% or better field-goal percentage through their first 50 career games. \u201cHe\u2019s just tough. There\u2019s only so much you can do,\u201d New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said: we want to use him more and more as the primary ballhandler, and I have more confidence in that because as well as he finishes and scores the ball inside, he\u2019s also a very willing passer.\u201d Williamson displayed as much in dropping 31 points to go with seven rebounds and six assists, while his counterpart Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with 28 points, seven rebounds and eight assists. The performance at the FedEx Forum marked the first time the No. 1 and No. 2 picks from the same draft (2019) produced 25 points, five rebounds and five assists against one another since Feb. 26, 1972, when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Neal Walk accomplished the feat, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Williamson tacked on a little more shine to his big night by knocking down his last 11 shots, which marked the third time this season he\u2019s hit more than 10 in a row game, according to Elias Sports Bureau. The 20-year-old also extended his league-best tally of five games before the age of 21 with 30 points or more on 75% or better from the field. \u201cI definitely feel a lot more comfortable,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut you know me. I know there\u2019s always room to grow, so I\u2019m just gonna keep building off it.\u201d That\u2019s also Van Gundy\u2019s plan for increasing Williamson\u2019s already significant role in New Orleans\u2019 offense. The Pelicans entered the contest Tuesday ranked 29 th in defensive rating (114.8). So, improving in that area is priority No. 1 right now with New Orleans snapping a three-game skid. But Van Gundy admitted he\u2019s trying to explore even more ways to utilize Williamson, who produced his third game this season in which he racked up 30-plus points while shooting better than 80%. Serving as more of a ballhandler now out on the perimeter, Williamson has taken on his new responsibilities almost seamlessly, while showing an uncanny knack for creating off the dribble. Williamson attributed that to the time spent as a youngster training as a point guard with his stepfather, Lee Anderson. \u201cSo, a point guard can\u2019t get rattled,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to remain calm, and always try to make the best play or find the best option. I think it just goes back to that. I\u2019m always on the move. So, the defense not only has to adjust to me getting to a spot. But also, they also have to adjust to me making a move. Also, I feel like I pull the defense in. So, I\u2019m finding my teammates a lot easier.\u201d Van Gundy envisioned Williamson taking on such a role long before he even took over as coach of the Pelicans. \u201cI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s much to adapt to for him. I think that he\u2019s played the game like this a lot in his life to be honest,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cI go back to training camp last year just watching them from afar. I think that [former coach] Alvin [Gentry] [and former assistant] Chris Finch and their coaching staff wanted to use Zion a lot the way we\u2019re using him now. Then, the injuries sort of took him back, and he was playing limited minutes coming back. They ended up using him pretty much primarily in the post. But I don\u2019t think that was their plan going into everything. Everybody knows that Zion can make plays on the perimeter. We\u2019ve just gone to it more and more and more. Early in the year, we weren\u2019t doing it a whole lot either. It takes a little bit of adaptation. But I think it\u2019s better, not only for him, it\u2019s better for our spacing because now you\u2019ve got a guy with the ball. You\u2019ve got three shooters around him and a big on the baseline. When Zion\u2019s on the ball, we\u2019ve got pretty typical NBA spacing. So, it\u2019s really not hard to play that way. He\u2019s got those abilities, and we keep trying to find more and more ways to use him. That\u2019s on me and our coaching staff to find more ways. We really haven\u2019t explored much new lately because we need to work on our defense in whatever time we have.\u201d In defeating the Grizzlies for the fifth time in a row, New Orleans put up season highs in points (144), paint points (70) and fast-break points (32), in addition to connecting on 61.5% from the field, which is the team\u2019s best shooting percentage in any game since November of 2014. Josh Hart contributed 27 points, his most ever as a Pelican, while Brandon Ingram chipped in 22 points. With 44 games remaining, the Pelicans need to make a climb up the Western Conference standings for a realistic shot at advancing to the postseason for the first time since 2018. Williamson\u2019s continued evolution should factor heavily into that. \u201cZion\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime player and can do a lot of different things on the floor,\u201d Pelicans point guard Lonzo Ball said. \u201cHe definitely can score in the post, but he\u2019s also very fluid with the ball up top, and we\u2019re using that to our advantage this year. He\u2019s really a point forward. Guys that are somewhat strong enough to guard him, it\u2019s gonna be difficult for them to stay in front of him. He has enough handle to get to where he needs to go, and then obviously has enough force to get to the rim. So, it\u2019s working out good for him, it\u2019s working out good for us. We like when he has the ball.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

He\u2019s coming off three modest performances that have driven his price way down, but there is a ton of upside to be had here for a guy who has scored better than 50 FD points seven times on the season. VanVleet doesn\u2019t typically come this cheap, so the time for savings in nigh. Khris Middleton (SF \u2013 MIL) : $7,500 vs. TOR With Jrue Holiday out yet again, Middleton should continue to see heavy minutes and get involved more as a facilitator. The over\/under for Bucks\/Raptors is the highest on the slate, and Middleton actually comes at a discount at this price. He\u2019s in play in this excellent game environment with a depreciated price thanks to a couple of recent down games. Al Horford (C \u2013 OKC) : $6,900 vs. POR Horford has been excellent across his last seven games (five without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), averaging 18.6 points, 5.4 assists and 1.6 steals in that span. In 11 games prior, he averaged 12.5 points, 2.5 assists and 0.6 steals. The absence of SGA has obviously been a boon for Horford\u2019s fantasy value, and the former will be out again tonight. Centers have fared very well against Enes Kanter and Co. this season, making Horford a great value on tonight\u2019s slate. Kyle Anderson (SF \u2013 MEM) : $6,500 vs. NO Anderson has been on a tear as of late, posting nearly 37 FD points per game across his last five while playing just under 30 minutes per contest. His production has come with Jonas Valanciunas and Ja Morant balling out, so Anderson\u2019s role in Memphis\u2019 rotation is secure. He\u2019ll look to continue his strong play against New Orleans tonight. Montrezl Harrell (C \u2013 LAL) : $5,900 at MIN Minnesota has surrendered fantasy points in buckets to opposing bigs, and Harrell should see more playing time with Anthony Davis out of action. Though Harrell hasn\u2019t been the fantasy darling we\u2019ve seen in seasons past, he\u2019s still plenty capable of posting big scoring and rebounding totals when given the opportunity. Kyle Kuzma (PF \u2013 LAL) : $5,800 at MIN Across his last four games, Kuzma has picked up his scoring and rebounding to the tune of 16.3 ppg and 9.3 rpg. He\u2019s consistently shown the ability to put up points throughout his career, but his recent spike in rebounding numbers is certainly encouraging. With Anthony Davis set to miss some time, Kuzma should see additional run, starting with a great matchup against Minnesota. Ricky Rubio (PG \u2013 MIN) : $5,500 vs. LAL Rubio has been inserted back into the starting lineup with D\u2019Angelo Russell out, and he figures to stay there with D\u2019Lo out again tonight. Rubio has only scored in double digits twice this season, so don\u2019t expect prolific scoring, but he\u2019s still capable of padding the stats with assists and steals as he\u2019s done throughout his career. Mikal Bridges (SF \u2013 PHO) : $5,300 vs. BKN Bridges has been wildly inconsistent across his last four games, but he\u2019s still providing the best numbers of his career thus far into the season. He\u2019s got a juicy matchup with Brooklyn\u2019s anemic defense tonight, and there is real 40-point upside to be had for a guy so reasonably priced. Take advantage of the bargain. Bobby Portis (PF \u2013 MIL) : $4,900 vs. TOR Bobby P has averaged better than 25 FD points per game this season, but he comes into this one on a hot streak, posting 16 points and 6.7 boards across his last three. The game environment is great in what should be a high-scoring affair, and at a sub-$5K price, Portis is a fantastic value. Kira Lewis (PG \u2013 NO) : $3,800 at MEM Across his last five games, Lewis has averaged 17 FD points in 18.4 minutes off the bench. He\u2019s slowly carving out a substantial role in New Orleans\u2019 rotation, and he\u2019s worth a gamble in tournaments tonight, priced at just $3.8K. In that five-game span, Lewis has eclipsed 24 FD points twice, so there is real value to be had here."},{"id":495141,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/top-defenders-ladder-rudy-gobert-ben-simmons-lead-new-weekly-ranking","date":"2021-02-16","title":"Defensive Player Ladder: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons lead new weekly ranking","content":"When the NBA released the second fan returns of All-Star Voting 2021 presented by AT&T last week, two players were conspicuously absent from the Top 10 at their respective positions. Both play for top contenders. Both have their All-Star bona fides, so it\u2019s not as if either should be considered a stretch or an afterthought. Both are having seasons as good as or better than they\u2019ve had in the past. Yet Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons were nowhere to be found among the 10 leading players at their respective positions \u2014 Western Conference frontcourt and Eastern Conference backcourt \u2014 after two weeks\u2019 worth of counting votes. In fact, Simmons went backwards, dropping from No. 10 after the first week to somewhere south of that position in the updated totals. Which serves as an awfully strong reminder: Offense sells. Defense? Meh. Gobert and Simmons are two of the NBA\u2019s most effective and celebrated defenders, playing that oh-so-important end of the floor, or so it\u2019s called up and down the hierarchy of basketball coaches. They\u2019re not slouches with the ball, mind you, each playing a vital role offensively for Gobert\u2019s Utah Jazz and Simmons\u2019 Philadelphia 76ers. But defense is where they really shine, and they can\u2019t get more All-Star balloting love than guys such as Andrew Wiggins, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Russell Westbrook (2020-21 edition) or at least 16 others at their spots. It\u2019s almost like an updated version of the old baseball saying from 60 or 70 years ago, \u201cHome run hitters drive Cadillacs, singles hitters drive Fords.\u201d Or MLB\u2019s 1999 variation (now considered embarrassing, in the wake of steroids scandals), \u201cChicks dig the long ball\u201d bit. In today\u2019s NBA, it\u2019s fair to say, fans dig the long ball, with 3-pointers raining from everywhere, from everyone. There\u2019s no automotive equivalent, since everybody on an NBA contract can drive whatever the heck they want. But this is undeniable: Scoring drives ratings and clicks. Consider: Of the 10 players leading at their positions last week as penciled-in starters \u2014 three in each frontcourt, two in each backcourt, five in each conference \u2014 eight ranked in the Top 10 in points per game. All 10 ranked in the Top 16, with overall vote getter LeBron James as that No. 16 guy with 25.5 ppg. Viewed a certain way, there\u2019s not a thing wrong with that. All-Star Games are about scoring, scoring is the surest path to stardom in this league and people want what they want when they vote for stuff. Yet many people view All-Star invitations as rewards for great half-seasons or for winning or for a burgeoning resume of hoops success. Gobert and Simmons certainly qualify along those lines \u2014 but nope, can\u2019t crack those Top 10s. Guess they need more than Simmons\u2019 one measly 3-point field goal between them. And given how much they share, maybe Simmons shouldn\u2019t have gotten so, er, offensive about Gobert\u2019s defense Monday night after scoring a career-high 42 against Utah (\u201cI loved it when I saw Rudy was guarding me. \u2026 I felt like it was a little bit of a disrespect putting him on me.\u201d). The Jazz, who went with that matchup when Sixers center Joel Embiid did not play, still won the game, after all. Here are some statistical areas where the two defensive maestros do shine: Simmons, a two-time All-Star as well as an All-Defensive Team selection and steals champ in 2019-20, ranked fourth in steals per game (1.7) through weekend action. He was first in deflections per game ( 4.1 ) and second in total deflections ( 98 ). The 6-foot-11 point guard also was second in loose balls recovered per game ( 1.5 ) and overall ( 36 ). Then there\u2019s Gobert, the NBA\u2019s Kia Defensive Player of the Year in 2018 and 2019 and, finally, a 2020 All-Star. He ranked first in defensive rebounds per game ( 9.8 ) and third overall ( 13.4 ). Second in blocks at 2.8 per game. His defensive rating ( 98.7 ) topped all NBA regulars and he ranked fourth in net rating ( 14.2 ). The \u201cStifle Tower\u201d was second in contested 2-point shots per game ( 11.6 ), per NBA.com stats, and third in contested shots overall ( 14.5 twos and threes ). And among centers or forward\/centers defending at least 10 shots per game, Gobert ranked first ( 18.1 ) and third in defended field-goal percentage, with opponents shooting 41.9% with the Jazz big man focused on them. All of which helps to explain what we\u2019re doing here. We already have the Kia Race To The MVP Ladder here, as well as the Kia Rookie Ladder to track the season-long jockeying for recognition among the league\u2019s most valuable players and top newcomers. It seems appropriate that if we truly value the other half of the game, as we\u2019re instructed constantly by coaches and many players, we have a regular round-up of some of the NBA\u2019s best at thwarting all that marvelous scoring. We will leave it to the conference coaches to recognize (or not) ace defenders like Gobert and Simmons as All-Stars when they cast their ballots for All-Star reserves. With analytics and that field\u2019s most ardent proponents admittedly limited in mining numbers that fully capture the defensive impact of individuals in a team activity, we\u2019ll cite but not entirely lean on statistics. We\u2019ll try to gauge the success of both bigs and perimeter players, the challenge with which voters for NBA Defensive Player of the Year are tasked. We\u2019ll hunt for a variety of factors, from 1-on-1 lockdowns to W-L records, with lots \u2014 including specific highlight plays or box score numbers \u2014 in between. We\u2019ll try to go less on reputation and more on current productivity, but not entirely or unfailingly. And we\u2019ll consider nominees weekly as well from readers, who may have had their jaws drop over a staggering display of defensive stinginess that passed under our radar. There probably will be tweaks to the process and the product as we go, the way a pilot episode roughs out rather than immediately nails the eventual sitcom ( remember \u201cThe Seinfeld Chronicles?\u201d ). For now, and with temporary apologies to Giannis Antetokounmpo (the reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year), Kawhi Leonard (2-time Defensive Player of the Year), Draymond Green (2017 Defensive Player of the Year), Bam Adebayo, Patrick Beverley, Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday and a couple dozen others whose names could pop up here in coming weeks, here are the Top 5 for the debut of the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Feb. 15) Getting one\u2019s arms around Gobert\u2019s defensive impact is a challenge. Frankly, he\u2019s better at getting his arms around pretty much anything. There are the stats cited above. There is the defensive confidence he gives the other four Utah players on the court at any time, knowing he is back there to clean up their mistakes. There are the countless number of shots not taken and drives not made once opponents remember who waits between them, the ball and the basket. And just for the record, Gobert leads the league this season in dunks, making others pay in ways he rarely allows. It wasn\u2019t just Monday that Simmons dissed Gobert as a defensive frat brother. Early in the NBA shutdown last March, he took a drive-by swipe at the Jazz center while immersed in some video gaming . Hey, just like people bring different definitions to the word \u201cvaluable\u201d when casting votes or forming opinions about MVP candidates, \u201cdefender\u201d can be just as nebulous. The 6-foot-10 Simmons has the skills, height and inclination to tackle any defensive assignment, making nights miserable for individual scorers compared to Gobert making them long for entire teams. 3. Myles Turner, Indiana Pacers Indiana\u2019s center led the league two seasons ago in blocked shots and blocks per game, and he\u2019s right back there at the top this season with 90 total and a career-best 3.46 per game . That\u2019s the third-highest average in the past 13 seasons, trailing only Hassan Whiteside\u2019s 3.68 in 2015-16 and Serge Ibaka\u2019s 3.65 in 2011-12. Turner and fellow Pacers big Domantas Sabonis have learned to play in tandem, proving naysayers wrong and enabling Sabonis to put up All-Star worthy numbers while Turner handles dirtier work. 4. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers He might slip off this list for a bit as he nurses his calf\/Achilles back to health. So think of this as planting a flag before he goes for Davis, based on his body of work so far in 2020-21 and for the Lakers\u2019 rank as the top team overall in defensive rating ( 105.1 points allowed per 100 possessions ). There\u2019s as big a gap in that category between them and No. 2 Utah (107.4) as there is from Utah to No. 9 San Antonio (109.7). Davis\u2019 ability to guard all five spots if needed, while protecting the rim most nights, explains his second-place finish in DPOY voting last season \u2014 as well as why the Lakers will miss him so much as he recuperates for a few weeks from his calf injury\/Achilles scare. 5. Lugentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder Dort is here in the inaugural Ladder as a rep for all those players who have made and can make defense their calling card, as they work on the rest of their games. On the night last month when Dort stole the ball six times from Chicago, he also scored 21 points with eight rebounds. On Valentine\u2019s Day against the Bucks, Dort had 19 points, seven boards and two steals. And as a 3-and-D guy, he has hit at least one from the arc in 21 of his 25 appearances. OKC has contested the most shots per game (64.7), grabbed the second-most clutch time steals (12) and rank eighth in recovering 3.4 loose ball defensively. This guy sets the tone for that. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Green spoke out after news broke of the Cavaliers sitting two-time All-Star center Andre Drummond because they\u2019re looking to deal him. Drummond watched Monday\u2019s game and cheered on his teammates from the bench while wearing street clothes. \u201cI would like to talk about something that\u2019s really bothering me. It\u2019s the treatment of players in this league,\u201d Green said , cursing to emphasize his point: \u201cTo watch Andre Drummond \u2026 come out in street clothes because a team is going to trade him, it\u2019s (expletive). \u201cBecause when James Harden asked for a trade and essentially dogged it \u2014 I don\u2019t think no one\u2019s gonna fight that James was dogging it his last days in Houston \u2014 but he was castrated for wanting to go to a different team, and everybody destroyed that man. \u201cYet a team can come out and say, \u2019Oh, we want to trade a guy,\u2032 and then that guy is to go sit and if he doesn\u2019t stay professional, then he\u2019s a cancer and he\u2019s not good in someone\u2019s locker room and he\u2019s the issue.\u201d Green pointed out how then-New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis was fined $50,000 for publicly demanding a trade in 2019 . \u201cAs a player, you\u2019re the worst person in the world when you want a different situation,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut a team can say they\u2019re trading you, and that man is to stay in shape, he is to stay professional, and if not his career is on the line. At some point, this league has to protect the players from embarrassment like that.\u201d Before Monday\u2019s game, Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff commended Drummond for the way he\u2019s handling the benching. Bickerstaff also said the decision to sit Drummond came only after consulting both Drummond and his agent about the situation. In Detroit, the Pistons plan to keep star forward Blake Griffin out of the lineup while he and the organization work out a decision on his future. \u201cAfter extensive conversation with Blake\u2019s representatives, it has been determined that we will begin working to facilitate a resolution regarding his future with the team that maximizes the interests of both parties,\u201d Pistons general manager Troy Weaver said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe respect all the effort Blake has put forth in Detroit and his career and will work to achieve a positive outcome for all involved.\u201d"},{"id":494910,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-set-franchise-record-in-made-3s-despite-durants-absence","date":"2021-02-16","title":"Nets set franchise record in made 3s despite Durant's absence","content":"Brooklyn\u2019s offensive ceiling might be the highest in the league. The Nets flashed that potential on Monday night, raining down a franchise-record 27 made 3-pointers on the Sacramento Kings in a 136-125 road victory. That was without Kevin Durant. The superstar forward, who has lived up to the billing despite a fresh return from a torn Achilles tendon, did not play Monday due to a \u201cmild\u201d hamstring strain . James Harden and Kyrie Irving easily shouldered the offense in Durant\u2019s absence. Harden was at his all-around best, finishing with a triple-double of 29 points, 13 rebounds, and 14 assists. Irving took on primary scoring duties, pouring in 40 points at an absurd 68.2% shooting clip (including 9-for-11 from 3). The amount of attention drawn by Brooklyn\u2019s star backcourt made it that much easier for everyone else. Nets not named Harden or Irving shot a combined 12-for-26 from distance, making for a 27-for-47 showing overall (57.4%) The long-distance barrage even sparked the Kings\u2019 social media team to jokingly propose a mid-game removal of the 3-point line. The 27 total 3s ties the Harden-led 2018-19 Houston Rockets for third-most in a game all-time, trailing this season\u2019s Rockets (Feb. 1) and Milwaukee Bucks (Dec. 29). The league\u2019s general surge in scoring is well-suited for the Nets, and not just their star players. Brooklyn\u2019s coaching staff is highlighted by Steve Nash, Mike D\u2019Antoni, and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, who headlined the pace-changing Phoenix Suns of the mid-2000s The Nets\u2019 early-season trade for Harden, whom D\u2019Antoni coached for years in Houston, only amplified the team\u2019s already considerable firepower. Brooklyn hopes its new identity will produce the franchise\u2019s first championship since its ABA days in the mid-1970s. Since the 1976 merger, the Nets have never made it past the second round of the playoffs outside a pair of back-to-back Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003.

Philadelphia\u2019s big man was coming off back-to-back 35-point efforts, albeit in losses for the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference. The Jazz topped the 76ers 134-123 thanks in large part to a stellar performance from Utah reserve Jordan Clarkson. He had a season-high 40 points off the bench to help offset a career-best 42 points from 76ers star guard Ben Simmons. Playing without his All-Star running mate, Simmons had 12 assists and nine rebounds \u2014 barely missing a triple-double.

The defending NBA champions made the announcement Monday after an MRI exam for Davis, who is out indefinitely. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Davis is expected to be reevaluated in 2-3 weeks. The All-NBA first-teamer left the Lakers\u2019 game at Denver in the second quarter Sunday night with an apparent aggravation of the tendonosis that has bothered his right heel for at least two weeks. The seven-time All-Star had already missed five games this season with various minor injuries. The Lakers (21-7) have nine games left before the All-Star break, starting Tuesday at Minnesota. Sitting in second place in the Western Conference, they are likely to be cautious with their superstar big man with an eye on keeping him healthy for the stretch run. Davis\u2019 offensive production is down this season with the Lakers less reliant on him after the additions of Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Montrezl Harrell and Marc Gasol. The nine-year veteran is averaging 22.5 points \u2014 his lowest scoring average since his second NBA season \u2014 along with 8.4 rebounds and 1.8 blocks.

In his first meeting against his old team in Houston on Jan. 26, Wall led the Rockets with 24 points and five assists in a 107-88 win. \u2022 Wall was drafted by Washington as the No. 1 overall pick in 2010 and spent his first nine seasons in D.C. During his time with the Wizards, Wall accrued several franchise top 10 rankings : seventh in games played (573), fourth in scoring (10,879), first in assists (5,282), first in steals (976), seventh in field goals made (3,942), fourth in 3-pointers made (539) and second in free throws made (2,456). \u2022 In their first meeting this season, Beal scored a game-high 33 points but needed 28 shots to get there (12-28 FG, 1-5 3P, 8-8 FT). Oladipo was the primary defender on Beal for a team high 4:32 (37% of Beal\u2019s offensive matchup time) and held Beal to seven points on 3-7 FG, 1-2 3P. Beal had more success against P.J. Tucker; in 1:50 of matchup time, Beal had 10 points on 3-6 FG, 4-4 FT, drawing three shooting fouls. \u2022 The Rockets enter Monday looking to snap a five-game losing streak \u2013 their longest single-season losing streak since dropping five straight from Dec. 20-29, 2017. In this current streak, the Rockets are averaging just 98.8 points per game , shooting 40.4% from the field and 27.6% on 3-pointers as a team. Their three road losses in this streak have been by an average of 25.4 points, while their two home losses have been by just 6.0 points. \u2022 Washington is coming off a 104-91 win over Boston on Sunday behind 35 points from Bradley Beal and a near triple-double from Russell Westbrook (13 pts, 11 ast, 9 reb). The Wizards are looking to win consecutive games for only the second time this season (Jan. 1-3), but will need to do so on the second night of a back-to-back. So far this season, the Wizards are 3-3 on zero days rest . Beal is averaging 34.8 points in five games with no rest, while this would be Westbrook\u2019s first time playing the second night of a back-to-back. \u2022 LA won the first meeting with Miami this season, 109-105 on Jan. 28 , as both teams played without their star players \u2013 Jimmy Butler for Miami, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard for LA. The Clippers rallied back from an 18-point deficit for the win as Nicolas Batum (18 points) led a balanced attack with six Clippers scoring at least 12 points in the win. \u2022 Tyler Herro led the Heat with 19 points in the first meeting with LA, but shot just 8-21 (41.7%) from the field and 1-6 (16.7%) on 3-pointers in the loss. Reggie Jackson defended Herro for a game-high 3:43 (36.4% of Herro\u2019s offensive matchup time) and held Herro to three points on 1-4 shooting. Luke Kennard defended Herro for 1:47 (17.5% of matchup time) and also held Herro to two points on 1-3 shooting. \u2022 The Clippers enter Monday having won three straight games and seven of their last 10 as they are one of just three teams (all in the West) to reach 20 wins so far this season. Lou Williams has appeared in all three games of the current streak and has averaged 24.7 points on 56% shooting from the field as well as 6.3 assists per game. Kawhi Leonard has played in two of the three games and scored a team-high 34.5 ppg on 58.7% shooting form their field and 50% on 3-pointers. \u2022 The Clippers are the top 3-point shooting team in the NBA at 42.2% \u2013 the only team shooting above 40% on the season. The Clippers have three of the top 10 3-point shooters in the league in Marcus Morris Sr. (4th, 48.4%), Paul George (7th, 47.8%) and Nic Batum (10th, 45.6%). \u2022 Patrick Beverley is shooting a career-best 43.6% from 3-point range this season as he is taking advantage of his open looks. Only four of Beverley\u2019s 78 3-point attempts have come with a defender within four feet of him, while 38 of his attempts are classified as open (closest defender between 4-6 feet away) and 36 have been wide open (closest defender at least 6 feet away)."},{"id":494581,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-to-sit-blake-griffin-as-team-begins-process-of-moving-him","date":"2021-02-15","title":"Pistons to sit Blake Griffin as team begins process of moving him","content":"The Detroit Pistons have decided to sit six-time All-Star Blake Griffin as the team and his representatives work to, \u201cfacilitate a resolution regarding his future with the team,\u201d according to reporting from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. \u201cAfter extensive conversation with Blake\u2019s representatives, it has been determined that we will begin working to facilitate a resolution regarding his future with the team that maximizes the interests of both parties,\u201d Pistons GM Troy Weaver told ESPN on Monday . \u201cWe respect all the effort Blake has put forth in Detroit and his career and will work to achieve a positive outcome for all involved.\u201d The Pistons reportedly will now facilitate trade offers for Griffin, who was acquired by the team from the LA Clippers in January of 2018. \u201cI am grateful to the Pistons for understanding what I want to accomplish in my career and for working together on the best path forward,\u201d Griffin said in a statement to ESPN. The 31-year-old forward has started 20 games for Detroit this season and is averaging career lows for points (12.3), field goal attempts (11.1) and free throw attempts (3.1). For his career, the former No. 1 overall pick is averaging 21.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists. He played in just 18 games last season after requiring season-ending left-knee surgery. Known for his athletic dunking prowess in his heyday, Griffin has not recorded a dunk in an NBA game since Dec. 12, 2019 \u2014 a span in which more than 440 other NBA players have gotten at least one dunk. If the Pistons are moving on from Griffin, one of his former teammates is reportedly also set to be traded. Cleveland Cavaliers center Andre Drummond \u2014 who played for Detroit from 2012-20 \u2014 is set to be moved soon per multiple reports. \u201cBlake\u2019s track record, his playing resume, speaks for itself,\u201d Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cSomeday, the guy\u2019s going to be a Hall of Famer. He\u2019s one of the players that I\u2019ve respected over the years. \u2026 He can be a piece to a contending team. I\u2019ve been with contending teams and you\u2019d love to have a guy like Blake Griffin on your team.\u201d Griffin has already reinvented himself once, so it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t do so again. Like many players in this 3-point era, he added that shot to his repertoire a few years back and it helped catapult him back to All-Star level in 2018-19 \u2014 he made 189 3\u2019s that season, two shy from matching the total from his first eight seasons combined, and averaged 24.5 points. The Pistons have played 93 games since. Griffin has missed 55 of them. If the Pistons can\u2019t find a trade for Griffin before the March 25 trade deadline, the team reportedly will consider buying out Griffin\u2019s contract, which reportedly is worth $36.6 million this season and $39 million in 2021-2022.

Feb. 15 Philadelphia (18-9) at Utah (22-5)  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The top team in the East (Philadelphia) and the top team in the West (Utah) meet for the first time this season. Utah is off to its best start in franchise history and enters the week having won seven straight and 18 of their last 19 games. The Jazz are the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive (116.0, 4th) and defensive (107.0, 2nd) efficiency. They will be tested against Kia MVP candidate Joel Embiid and a Philly squad looking to snap a two-game losing streak as they wrap a four-game road trip in Salt Lake City. The Sixers are 11-2 at home, but just 7-7 on the road. Feb. 16 Denver (15-11) at Boston (13-13)  7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Nuggets enter Week 9 riding a three-game win streak, including a 17-point win over the defending champion Lakers Sunday behind Nikola Jokic\u2019s sixth triple-double of the season (2nd in NBA) and a game-high 25 points from Jamal Murray. This season has been a bit of a yo-yo for the Nuggets as this three-game win streak follows a stretch where they lost four of five games, which was preceded by a five-game win streak. Denver will look to extend its current streak to four games against a Boston team that is looking to right its own ship. The Celtics enter this week having lost two straight and four of their last five games. Since opening the season 8-3, Boston has gone 5-10 over its past 15 games. Feb. 17 Portland (16-10) at New Orleans (11-15)  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Portland enters the week riding a four-game win streak thanks to the latest episode of Dame Time with Damian Lillard knocking down the go-ahead 3-pointer with 32 seconds to lead the Blazers past the Mavericks on Sunday. Lillard ranks fourth in clutch scoring this season with 58 points in 45 clutch minutes (score inside five points in final five minutes). Lillard is shooting 55.2% from the field, 41.7% from 3-point range and hit all 21 of his free throws with the game on the line. Utah (22-5) at LA Clippers (20-8)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After opening the week against the top team in the East, the Jazz get another strong test with a matchup with the Clippers on Wednesday. Entering Week 9, there are three teams in the league that have reached 20 wins \u2013 these two teams, and the team that they are looking to dethrone, the defending champion Lakers. Utah won the first meeting with LA on New Year\u2019s Day behind a big game from Mike Conley. A key question heading into their second matchup will be the availability of Clippers stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. George has missed five straight games with a right foot injury and Kawhi joined him on the sideline over the weekend with a lower leg contusion. Feb. 19 Golden State (14-13) at Orlando (10-18)  7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Stephen Curry is tied with Bradley Beal and Luka Doncic for the most 40-point games of the season so far with three entering Week 9. His latest 40-point effort came against the Magic on Feb. 11 as he shot 14-26 from the field and 10-19 on 3-pointers to lead the Warriors to 111-105 win in the Bay Area. With the scene shifting to Orlando for the rematch, will Curry have the same shooting touch against the Magic? Feb. 20 Washington (7-17) at Portland (16-10)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Who is ready for a duel between two of the top four scorers in the NBA on a Saturday night. League-leading scorer Bradley Beal (32.9 ppg) and the Wizards will be in Portland to take on Damian Lillard (29.2 ppg, 4th in NBA) and the Blazers. In their first meeting on Feb. 2, Beal won the individual scoring battle 37-32, but it was Lillard and the Blazers that earned the 132-121 win. The short-handed Blazers (without C.J. McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic due to injury) have found a way to keep winning as they enter the week having won four in a row and six of their last seven games. Feb. 21 Sacramento (12-14) at Milwaukee (16-11)  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass No player on the current Kings roster was on the team the last time the Kings beat the Bucks on Feb. 1, 2016. The Bucks have won eight straight meetings with the Kings and will look to continue their dominance in the matchup when they host Sacramento on Sunday. The Bucks are 9-2 at home this season, but the Kings enter the week having won four of their last five road games. One of those wins came in Toronto as it snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Raptors.

The Utah Jazz had been pretty healthy. Through Feb. 5, their top nine guys had missed a total of eight games , four from Joe Ingles and two each from Donovan Mitchell and Derrick Favors. That had earned their 18-5 record at that point, but compared to other teams, they had been lucky in regard to health. Then they lost Mike Conley, the guy who, at the time, led the league in on-off differential, with the Jazz having been 23.6 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (+17.7) than they\u2019d been with him off the floor (-5.9). And a hamstring issue has had Conley out each of the last four games. But the Jazz have just kept rolling along, beating four good teams to run their current winning streak to seven games, tied for the second longest winning streak of the season thus far. The longest, of course, was the Jazz\u2019s 11-game streak that preceded it. So yeah, the Jazz are finally No. 1 in the Power Rankings.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. Dario Saric (PF\/C \u2013 PHO) : 10% rostered Saric missed 13 games due to COVID-19 and an ankle injury. He returned on Saturday and played 20 minutes, contributing 15 points, one 3-pointer, two rebounds, four assists, four steals, and one block. The usage rate was a robust 30.4. Prior to going down, he was averaging 18.8 minutes per contest, so somewhere in the 20-minute range seems like a viable outcome. There is the possibility for more if he overtakes Frank Kaminsky in the starting lineup, though. With that said, don\u2019t expect many defensive stats, but what Saric can provide are points, 3-pointers, and rebounds while shooting well from both the field and free-throw line. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SA) : 44% rostered This is predicated on the health of LaMarcus Aldridge, who is dealing with a hip injury. If he returns, then Poeltl will go back to playing 20 minutes per game. If Poeltl continues to start, though, he should contribute plenty of rebounds and blocks. Curiously, he\u2019s alternated between good and bad games over the last five games. If this was an SAT test, then he\u2019s going to have a bad game next time out, but good thing fantasy basketball doesn\u2019t work that. Right? Carmelo Anthony (SF\/PF \u2013 POR) : 45% rostered Anthony has been blisteringly hot over the last three games, converting 52% of his 14.7 field goal attempts for 23.2 points per game. He\u2019s averaged four 3-pointers over that span and garnered a usage rate of 31.5. On the season, he\u2019s averaging 1.8 3-pointers with a 23.1 usage rate while also shooting 39% from the field. The minutes have remained constant at 24.3 per game. He\u2019s going to regress, but there\u2019s a chance the heater continues in the short term. Anthony only plays three games this week, but there\u2019s a matchup against the Wizards, one of the most fantasy-friendly opponents out there. Dorian Finney-Smith (SF\/PF \u2013 DAL) : 8% rostered Over the last three games, Finney-Smith has been a top 55 player, averaging 9.7 points, two 3-pointers, 6.3 rebounds, two assists, one steal, and 0.7 blocks while shooting 68% from the field. Now, he\u2019s a super-low usage player and shoots 43% from the field on the season, so the hot shooting and point production isn\u2019t going to continue. He does play a ton of minutes (35 over the past three games) and will contribute a little in every category. Grayson Allen (SG\/SF \u2013 MEM) : 10% rostered Allen has played 30 and 35 minutes the last two games while starting one of those. De\u2019Anthony Melton and Desmond Bane have been out, so as long as they\u2019re out, Allen should see plenty of playing time. He contributed 23 points, six 3-pointers, three rebounds, one assist, and two steals in one game while going 18 points, five 3-pointers, three rebounds, three assists, and one steal in the other. The usage rate has been 21.4 and 22.6. Now, all three teams that Memphis plays this week are in the bottom third of offensive pace, but Detroit boosts the fantasy points per minute to small forwards by 13.43% above league average, the most generous in the league. Kenrich Williams (SF\/PF \u2013 OKC) : 8% rostered Williams has started the last two games because Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has missed time due to a knee injury. If Shai returns, then forget about Williams, but if he misses, then he becomes a viable option. Williams has played 36 and 40 minutes the last two games and contributed in everything but blocks. He went for 24 points, two 3-pointers, six rebounds, two assists, and three steals against the Lakers while he contributed seven points, one 3-pointer, 11 rebounds, nine assists, and one steal against the Nuggets. Kendrick Nunn (PG\/SG \u2013 MIA) : 42% rostered Like Williams, Nunn has been starting because Goran Dragic has been out with an ankle injury. Even when he returns, Nunn could continue seeing significant playing time because Avery Bradley is out for an extended period of time. Over the last five games, Nunn has been a top 60 player, averaging 18.2 points, three 3-pointers, 4.4 rebounds, two assists, and two steals while shooting 50% from the field and 85% from the line. The usage rate has been a respectable 23.2, and he\u2019s been playing 34.2 minutes per game. T. J. McConnell (PG\/SG \u2013 IND) : 31% rostered Man, what\u2019s a guy have to do to get some respect on the fantasy streets? After missing three games due to his child\u2019s birth, McConnell has averaged 26 minutes, 9.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, eight assists, 0.4 blocks, and 1.9 steals over a 16-game span. Eight assists and 1.9 steals! A true specialist, but what a specialist he is. Willy Hernangomez (C \u2013 NO) : 1% rostered After rotting away on the bench for much of the season, Hernangomez has risen from the ashes and become a part of the Pelicans\u2019 rotation. Over the last seven games, he\u2019s overtaken Jaxson Hayes for the backup center minutes and averaged 20.8 minutes, 8.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.7 steals, and 0.7 blocks while shooting 57% from the field and 66% from the line."},{"id":494490,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-feb-15","date":"2021-02-15","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Feb. 15)","content":"Tyrese Haliburton (SG \u2013 SAC) : $6,100 at BKN Haliburton still garnered 31 minutes and 35.8 fantasy points against the Grizzlies despite coming off the bench yesterday. The Kings rookie has posted at least 25 fantasy points in each of his last nine games. His playing time seems to be stable around the 30 minutes benchmark, which is why his stock continues to rise. Playing against an up-tempo Brooklyn team that plays no defense, the Iowa State product is poised to have another solid outing. DeMarcus Cousins (C \u2013 HOU) : $6,100 at WAS Assuming Christian Wood is still out, Cousins will continue to be a solid value below the $7,000 price range as he soaks up most of the Rockets\u2019 minutes at center. Coming off a mediocre performance against the Knicks, he is bound to bounce back against Washington in a pace-up spot. The Wizards have allowed the 26th most fantasy points to centers this season, so Boogie should do quite well here. His ownership might be a bit too high for GPP\u2019s, but he is a worthy cash play. Tyler Herro (SG \u2013 MIA) : $5,700 at LAC After being deemed a late scratch on Thursday due to health protocols, Herro struggled Saturday against a stingy Utah defense, posting just 24.6 fantasy points across 32 minutes. The Clippers offer a much more favorable matchup, and I expect Herro to be back in the starting lineup tonight. When the Heat played Los Angeles earlier this season, Herro posted 38.5 points across 31 minutes, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he runs it back this time around. Jordan Clarkson (SG \u2013 UTA) : $5,500 vs. PHI While Clarkson is expected to come off the bench tonight, he has still played 27 or more minutes in his last four games. With that being said, he is a GPP only play to me, as he holds the potential to reach 35+, but also can put up a dud performance. He is bound to take plenty of shots and still gets his fair share of rebounds and assists. Clarkson has shown he can produce against solid defenses as well, scoring 38.3 fantasy points against the Bucks just a few days ago. Joe Ingles (SF \u2013 UTA) : $4,900 vs. PHI With Ingles being $600 cheaper than Clarkson and expected to soak up the starting minutes, I like him more so in cash lineups. Ingles hasn\u2019t exactly been phenomenal of late, but the opportunity has been there, and at a cheaper price, he presents a lower risk. I expect this game to be closer than their last two blowouts, so Ingles could easily see a slight uptick in minutes and usage as well. Nerlens Noel (PF \u2013 NY) : $4,800 vs. ATL Mitchell Robinson\u2019s injury means Noel slots right into the Knicks\u2019 starting lineup, so his $4,800 price tag offers great value. He saw 32 minutes last game, and I expect similar playing time against the Hawks in a pace-up spot. Noel is very much capable of breaking the 30-point threshold, and I see him as a solid GPP and cash play based on the opportunity he will have on the court. Patrick Williams (PF \u2013 CHI) : $4,500 at IND Coming off a rough outing versus the Clippers on Friday, tonight offers a prime bounce-back spot for the Bulls rookie. Williams has seen north of 30 minutes in each of his last six games, and with the injury troubles Chicago currently faces, I fully expect that to stay the same tonight in Indy. I would mostly avoid Williams in cash lineups, but he is a fine GPP play, as he has shown his capability of a 30+ fantasy point outing. Hassan Whiteside (C \u2013 SAC) : $4,500 at BKN Consistency is one of the last words I\u2019d use to describe Hassan Whiteside, but in a solid matchup with Marvin Bagley III potentially out again, I\u2019m going right back to the well here. Whiteside is hands down a GPP only play, but his chance of a boom game outweighs his ownership projection. I can\u2019t expect him to be owned by much of the field, so he can be your diamond in the rough for today\u2019s slate. Danuel House (SF \u2013 HOU) : $4,200 at WAS I know House is coming off a dud performance, but that almost makes me like him more as the rest of the field is more likely to avoid him. In a pace-up spot against a bad Washington defense, House\u2019s minutes should see a nice bump from the 22 he had last game. Not only that, but I don\u2019t expect him to go scoreless again, and we\u2019ve witnessed his boom performances previously. He is definitely risky, but I will be over the field in ownership as I believe he has the potential to more than pay off his price. Bruce Brown (SG \u2013 BKN) : $3,900 vs. SAC With Kevin Durant sidelined and facing one of the worst defenses in the league in a pace-up spot, Bruce Brown might be one of the chalkiest plays of the slate with his $3,900 price tag. I expect him to slot into the starting lineup and put up a lot of shots in this game. Any starter under $4k will almost always be good value and someone on a team who might post 150 points certainly is."},{"id":494469,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wallace-becomes-1st-black-driver-to-lead-lap-at-daytona-500","date":"2021-02-15","title":"Wallace becomes 1st Black driver to lead lap at Daytona 500","content":"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Bubba Wallace ran into trouble early and late in his first Daytona 500 driving for Michael Jordan .

Wallace dipped to the low line late in the second stage to grab the lead on lap 129 in the No. 23 Toyota. He lost the lead back to two-time defending champion Denny Hamlin \u2014 who co-owns 23XI with Jordan \u2014 and ran third at the end of the stage. Wallace got caught up in a fiery, chaotic last lap and finished 17th in a race won by Michael McDowell. \u201cBum end. I bailed out down the back saw the wreck happening and got run over from behind. Should\u2019ve bailed sooner,\u201d Wallace tweeted. \u201cFast car, can\u2019t have loose wheels. Onto the right turns.\u201d Wallace was forced to pit with 22 laps left in the race because he felt a vibration because of the loose wheel in the Toyota. He fell a lap down and pushed Hamlin to give his boss and Toyota teammate a nudge toward his run at a record third straight Daytona 500 championship. Hamlin finished fifth. \u201cWe worked together quite a few times,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cI actually thought he was going to win the second stage.\u201d Wallace finished second in the 2018 Daytona 500 for the highest finish in the race by a Black driver. Wallace had a solid first two-thirds of the rain-delayed race at Daytona International Speedway after a tumultuous start in Jordan\u2019s debut race. \u201cHe was running up front and battling for stage wins. That\u2019s what we want to see,\u201d Hamlin said. Jordan\u2019s No. 23 Toyota failed inspection twice before the race, prompting NASCAR to kick the team\u2019s car chief out off the grounds. The car passed on the third attempt, but had to start from the back of the field. Jordan watched the beginning of the race from a luxury suite. The six-time NBA champion had his first conversation with the 23XI crew chief when he called Mike Wheeler to find out why the team failed inspection. Jordan entered NASCAR as the first Black principal owner of a full-time Cup Series team in nearly 50 years. He\u2019s tight with Hamlin and has rooted on the Joe Gibbs Racing driver from the pits in the past. This venture is no lark for Jordan. Jordan was a kid when his late father packed up the car and took the family to NASCAR races at Southern tracks like Daytona, Darlington Raceway and defunct Rockingham Speedway. Jordan once said he sets his clock to watch NASCAR every week. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Jordan and Wallace never met until this week. Jordan hit town in the days before the race and played some golf \u2014 naturally \u2014 and had a made-for-TV team meeting with Wallace and Hamlin. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s going to learn how to win. He\u2019s got the talent,\u201d Jordan told Fox Sports. \u201cWe would not have invested in him and picked him if he didn\u2019t have the talent to win. By the end of the year, I think he\u2019s going to have an opportunity and probably will win at least a couple of races. If it\u2019s more, I\u2019d be elated.\u201d Wallace was winless in his first 112 career Cup starts, all driving the No. 43 for Richard Petty Motorsports. Wallace is the only Black full-time driver at NASCAR\u2019s top level and raised his profile last summer when he successfully called for the series to ban the display of Confederate flags at racetracks. His activism caught the attention of corporate America, which raised enough funding through five companies to sponsor the entire Cup season. The 27-year-old Wallace flashed speed in the No. 23 Toyota \u2014 yes, Jordan\u2019s old Bulls number \u2014 at Speedweeks and topped the only practice session this week. He qualified sixth before he fell to the back of the pack because of issues that emerged out of pit stop practice. "}]
