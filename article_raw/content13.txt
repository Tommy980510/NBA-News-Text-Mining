For now, it\u2019s the best idea the Nuggets have \u2014 as they, like every other NBA team, are figuring out new ways to do almost everything. Nobody knows when NBA players will be in a game again, with the season on hold because of the global coronavirus pandemic. Most don\u2019t even have access to basketball courts right now, and every team training facility is shuttered right now for safety reasons. Public health clubs and gyms are off-limits, too. But the workouts, somehow, continue. Teams cannot mandate that players take part, but common sense dictates that players still get some sort of workout plan to follow. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting subject,\u201d said Claus Antunes de Souza, the Nuggets\u2019 assistant strength and conditioning coach. \u201cKeeping an athlete motivated when they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to perform is probably one of the hardest tasks ever. Even in an offseason you kind of have a defined date when you\u2019re going to report back. So not having one of those dates in mind, it makes things very tricky.\u201d The Nuggets get their workouts to players on a platform called Teambuildr, a site where remote workouts can be programmed and progress can be tracked. The site says a half-dozen NBA teams are using its technology, with Oklahoma City, Houston, Charlotte, Minnesota and Detroit being the others \u2014 along with some Major League Baseball, NHL and NFL teams. Other teams are figuring out their own methods: Kevin Huerter said he\u2019s using FaceTime with members of the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 staff when he\u2019s working out in his basement. The Orlando Magic plan to start utilizing FaceTime to monitor player workouts in the next few days. Zoom, a video conferencing tool, is being used by some teams for workouts where players are together \u2014 virtually, anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bike here at home now, I\u2019ve got some weights here, so I wake up and I do what I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, who has been working his way back from a knee injury. \u201cI\u2019ve still been able to progress in my rehab through this thing and you do what you have to do. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re all doing right now.\u201d Magic high performance director David Tenney sent plans to players as well, plus reminded them about the importance of continuing to value nutrition \u2014 with an eye on both their physical and mental health. \u201cWhile we often recommend lean meats (like fish and chicken) and vegetables for our guys all season, this is a period when it may be even more important,\u201d Tenney said. The NBA has allowed teams to send equipment to players\u2019 homes for workout purposes during the shutdown, and it appears most if not all have taken advantage. Miami\u2019s Kendrick Nunn showed off a newly delivered bike at his home in a social-media post, and the Heat are among the teams gathering online in small groups while their daily cardio gets done. Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Friday that his team is doing something similar through what he called \u201cvoluntary virtual sessions.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been bikes delivered, there\u2019s been individual weights delivered,\u201d Stevens said on a call with Celtics\u2019 beat writers. LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has been self-isolating at home for the last two weeks, part of the process his team had to go through after two players tested positive for the coronavirus. James is one of the more fortunate NBA shut-ins; his Brentwood estate has a gym, and James has been going through once- or twice-daily workouts for most of this hiatus. But he hasn\u2019t been playing basketball, and that\u2019s a big difference between now and the 2011 NBA lockout \u2014 since then, at least courts were available. \u201cMy body was like, \u2018Hey man, what the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d James said this week on the \u201cRoad Trippin\u2019\u201d podcast on the Uninterrupted platform. \u201cIt\u2019s March 13. You\u2019re getting ready for the playoffs. Why are you shutting down right now? And I was right there turning the corner. I felt like I was rounding third base, getting ready for the postseason.\u201d His postseason-prep is on hold, like everything else in the NBA. Christian Wood of the Detroit Pistons tested positive for the virus and, earlier this week, was deemed to have recovered . But his teammates also had to self-isolate for two weeks, and that means the Pistons are in the very early stages now of figuring out how to gather themselves as a team and try to get ready for resuming a season that \u2014 especially for a team that isn\u2019t going to the playoffs \u2014 may already be over. \u201cHonestly, in my opinion at the moment, there\u2019s almost enough time right now to almost warrant an offseason program to regain a lot of the qualities that we\u2019ve already lost,\u201d Pistons head strength and conditioning coach Jordan Sabourin said. \u201cIn my mind, I\u2019m almost approaching this as an offseason thing. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to change in the next week or two, so it\u2019s like starting phase one of an offseason program.\u201d The NBA has said it wants to resume the season. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wants to see a playoff, wants to see a champion eventually be crowned. Most teams had about 17 regular-season games left; it\u2019s unclear how many, if any, of those will happen when and if play resumes. Games are likely several weeks, at minimum, away. So the good news is that teams have time to figure out the new normal. \u201cThe priority is not, \u2018We\u2019ve got to keep training as much as we can,\u2019\u201d Souza said. \u201cHonestly, the priority is to make sure players are in a good mental space and know that they have support, that the team\u2019s going to do anything for them in order to help their development and continue to do so. And then we\u2019ll start ramping up once we know that we\u2019re getting closer to hopefully playing again.\u201d"},{"id":28105,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-know-zion-williamson-chris-paul-lebron-james-anthony-davis-james-harden","date":"2020-03-27","title":"10 Numbers to Know from the 2019-20 season thus far","content":" As we wait for basketball to resume \u2014 with 971 games in the books \u2014 here are 10 numbers to know from the 2019-20 season thus far: THE STAT Zion Williamson has averaged 20.9 points in the paint per 36 minutes , the highest rate for any player (minimum 500 minutes played) in the 24 seasons for which the stat has been tracked. THE CONTEXT Last season, Giannis Antetokounmpo averaged 17.5 points in the paint per game , the highest mark for any player (minimum 40 games played) since Shaquille O\u2019Neal averaged 19.6 in 2002-03 . This season, Antetokounmpo has topped his own mark ( 17.51 vs. 17.47), even though he\u2019s averaged almost two fewer minutes per game. His points in the paint per 36 minutes (20.4) would be the highest mark since Shaq averaged 20.8 per 36 in 1998-99 \u2026 \u2026 if it weren\u2019t Williamson, who has topped any mark from Antetokounmpo, O\u2019Neal, and everybody else in the last 24 years. Williamson made four 3-pointers in his debut, but shot 2-for-9 from beyond the arc after that. And he\u2019s shot just 2-for-10 from mid-range to start his career. But he\u2019s taken 85% of his shots in the restricted area, the fifth-highest rate among 296 players with at least 200 field goal attempts this season. The No. 1 pick in last year\u2019s Draft has played just 19 games, and his seven games of 20 or more points in the paint matches LeBron James , and more than than Anthony Davis ( 6 ), Joel Embiid ( 1 ) or James Harden ( 6 ). Williamson\u2019s 565 minutes represent a small sample size, and maybe he can\u2019t sustain this pace moving forward. But maybe he can. Those 565 minutes are also his initial sample size, and you can certainly make the argument that he\u2019ll become more efficient in the paint as he gains experience. Williamson\u2019s 63.1% shooting in the restricted area ranks just 53rd among 89 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts, and if you compare rookie shooting numbers with those of fourth-year players, there\u2019s a slightly bigger jump in the restricted area (from 59.9% to 62.7%) than in 3-point percentage (33.2% to 35.9%). ADDITIONAL NOTE \u2022 For the season, Russell Westbrook ranks third in points in the paint per game (15.2) and seventh in points in the paint per 36 minutes (15.2). But in mid-January (a couple of weeks before the Rockets went to their center-less lineup), Westbrook changed up his shot selection. And since then, he\u2019s led the league with 20.4 points in the paint per game and ranks third with 19.9 per 36 minutes. THE STAT The Bucks\u2019 defense has allowed 13.7 3-pointers per game , most in NBA history. THE CONTEXT That number is somewhat pace-aided. The Bucks have averaged 105.4 possessions per 48 minutes , the fastest pace in the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data. The 13.0 3-pointers they\u2019ve allowed per 100 possessions is only fifth-most in the league this season. Still, it\u2019s rather amazing that a team can allow so many 3s and still have the league\u2019s No. 1 defense by a wide margin. The 101.6 points the Bucks have allowed per 100 possessions are 3.3 fewer than any other team and 8.4 fewer than the league average. That latter differential is the second best in the 24 seasons for which we have play-by-play data, just a hair behind that of the 2003-04 San Antonio Spurs. The Bucks ranked first defensively last season , and they\u2019ve been the league\u2019s fourth-most improved defensive team, allowing 3.3 fewer points per 100 possessions. Though they\u2019ve seen a jump in opponent 3-point percentage, they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in opponent effective field goal percentage, from 50.3% ( 1st ) last season to 48.6% ( Also 1st ) this season. It\u2019s all about how well they\u2019ve protected the rim. The Bucks led the league in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (58.0%) last season, and they\u2019ve only gotten better. They\u2019ve seen the second-biggest drop from last season, leading the league again at 54.9%. As a whole, the league has shot 63.4% in the restricted area, the highest mark in the 24 years for which we have shot-location data. But the Bucks have managed to produce the lowest opponent mark of the last six seasons. Brook Lopez is one of two players (Hassan Whiteside is the other) who have played at least 750 minutes and have more blocks (149) than personal fouls (147). Opponents have shot 46.9% at the rim when Lopez has been there to protect it. That\u2019s the best rim-protection mark \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 among 23 players who have defended at least 300 shots at the rim. His brother Robin has the best mark (45.8%) among 69 players who have defended at least 200 shots at the rim. And Giannis Antetokounmpo has the best mark (41.8%) among 233 players who have defended at least 100 shots at the rim. But the success of the Bucks\u2019 defense actually starts with the number of attempts they\u2019ve allowed at the rim. That 54.9% shooting in the restricted area still translates to 1.10 points per attempt, a rate better than the league average (1.06) for all shots from the floor. It follows that preventing shots at the rim is just as important than defending them. Last season, only 27.3% of the Bucks\u2019 opponents\u2019 shots came in the restricted area \u2014 the league\u2019s lowest rate. And again, Milwaukee has produced a drop. This season, only 26.0% of their opponents\u2019 shots have come in the restricted area. The next closest opponent mark is 28.1% (Brooklyn) and the league average is 32.3%. The Bucks are the best in the league, by a wide margin , at protecting the rim. And they\u2019re the best in the league, by a wide margin , at defending the rim. The 36.7 points in the paint they\u2019ve allowed per 100 possessions represents the fewest anyone\u2019s given up in the last 13 seasons. Zion Williamson, as noted above, has averaged the most points in the paint per 36 minutes in the last 24 years. His lowest PIP\/36 number of the season came when he scored just 10 points in the paint in 32 minutes against the Bucks on Feb. 4. Just as amazing is the Bucks\u2019 ability to protect the rim without fouling much. They rank fourth in opponent free throw rate, allowing just 22.0 free throw attempts per 100 shots from the field. And the Bucks have grabbed 77.6% of available defensive rebounds, leading the league with the highest rate in these 24 years for which we have play-by-play data. The 10.5 second-chance points that they\u2019ve allowed per 100 possessions is also tied for the best mark of the last 24 years. The Bucks can be beat with elite ball movement (out of paint attacks) and shot making. Six different teams \u2013 Denver , Memphis , Philadelphia , Phoenix , San Antonio and Utah \u2013 have had their season high for made 3-pointers against the league\u2019s No. 1 defense, and the Bucks have lost four of those six games. But the Bucks will continue to play the numbers. The league may be taking more 3-pointers than ever, but shots in the restricted area remain the most valuable on the floor. The Bucks sell out to prevent and defend those shots, and they\u2019ve been rewarded for doing so. THE STAT Chris Paul leads the league with 144 points scored in the clutch (when the score is within five points during the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime). THE CONTEXT Volume has been a factor. Paul has played a league-high 160 clutch minutes in a league-high 42 clutch games . But efficiency has been a factor as well. Paul has shot 46-for-86 (53.5%) in those situations, the fourth-best mark among 28 players who have attempted at least 50. That includes a pretty incredible 17-for-27 (63%) from mid-range, as well as a 43-for-46 (93%) showing on clutch free throws, the best mark among 32 players who have attempted at least 25. There might be some luck baked into that 17-for-27 from mid-range, but it\u2019s also an extension of what Paul has done at all points of the game this season. Paul has an effective field goal percentage of 54.2% on pull-up jumpers, the second-best mark among 139 players who have attempted at least 100. His 1.09 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler also rank second among 56 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. And his 53.9% from mid-range is the best mark among 79 players with at least 100 such attempts. In fact, it\u2019s the second-best mark on at least 200 attempts in the last 15 seasons, with Kevin Durant\u2019s 55.1% last season the only one that tops it. At the age of 34 and in his 15th season, Paul knows how to take advantage of the way most teams defend the pick and roll. That\u2019s a big reason why the Thunder are 29-13 (including 25-5 since Nov. 25 ) in games that have been within five points during the last five minutes. They rank fifth place in the West with the conference\u2019s seventh-best point differential. THE STAT The Mavs rank 29th in clutch offense , having scored just 94.3 points per 100 possessions with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. THE CONTEXT The Mavs are the anti-Thunder, in seventh place in the West with the conference\u2019s third-best point differential (+6.0 per game). Overall, the 115.8 points per 100 possessions the Mavs have scored represents the highest mark in the 24 seasons for which we\u2019ve had play-by-play data and \u2014 likely \u2014 NBA history. That doesn\u2019t mean that the Mavs have the best offense ever. The difference between their mark (115.8) and the league average (109.9) is 5.8 points per 100 possessions, just the 24th-best mark of the last 24 seasons. (The biggest differential belongs to the 2003-04 Mavs, who scored 9.0 more points per 100 possessions more than the league average.) Still, the Mavs have had the most efficient offense in the most efficient season in NBA history (see No. 10 below). They rank among the top five in field goal percentage in the paint (57.5%; 4th), effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (52.7%; 2nd), and turnover rate (12.7 per 100 possessions, 2nd). No other team ranks in the top 10 of all three. Yet down the stretch of close games, the Mavs\u2019 offense has fallen apart. The team has taken 223 clutch field goal attempts , with Tim Hardaway Jr. (33 clutch FGA; 37.9% clutch eFG%), Luka Doncic (65; 36.9%) and Kristaps Porzingis (40; 32.5%) accounting for 138 (62%) of those, despite ranking 64th, 67th and 70th in clutch effective field goal percentage among the 71 players who have attempted at least 25 such shots. The Mavs are the only team that took more than half of their clutch shots (51.6%) from 3-point range. But they rank last in clutch 3-point percentage at 22.6%. Doncic has shot 6-for-35 (17%) on clutch 3-pointers, the third-worst mark among 40 players who have attempted at least 20. He\u2019s 0-for-9 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, with eight of those nine attempts having come from beyond the arc. Also, while the Mavs rank 15th in overall free throw percentage at 77.3%, they rank 28th in clutch free throw percentage (just 70.5%). Put it all together and they\u2019re 14-21 in games that were within five during the last five \u2014 the worst mark among the 16 teams in playoff position. In games that weren\u2019t within five in the last five, the Mavs are 26-6. Only the Celtics and Lakers, with five losses each, have taken fewer Ls in games that weren\u2019t close at the end. The Mavs\u2019 40 wins have been by an average of 14.8 points , while their 27 losses have been by an average of just 6.9. They\u2019ve made the league\u2019s second-biggest jump in winning percentage from last season, but it could be bigger. At 40-27, they have produced the league\u2019s biggest difference between \u201cexpected\u201d wins (based on point differential) and actual wins. Their point differential mirrors that of a team who\u2019d be 47-20 at this point, a record that would rank them second in the West. THE STAT LeBron James has 172 assists to Anthony Davis . THE CONTEXT That\u2019s 42 more assists than any other player has to a single teammate and 30 more assists than James has had to a single teammate in any of his 16 prior seasons. At the age of 35, James is averaging a career-high \u2014 and also league-leading \u2014 10.6 assists per game. Davis is the biggest reason why. His combination of size, skill and athleticism is unmatched among James\u2019 teammates over 17 seasons. Prior to 2019-20, the most assists James delivered to a single teammate in a single season was 142 (Chris Bosh, Heat; \u201913-14) \u2026 in 870 more minutes together than James and Davis have played together this season. The 1,317 minutes James and Davis have played together ranks 107th among all two-man combinations this season. But the 4.7 assists per 36 minutes from James to Davis is the most among the 34 combinations where one player has at least 75 assists to the other. ADDITIONAL NOTES Next on the list for total assists from one player to a single teammate: 2. Damian Lillard to Hassan Whiteside ( 130 ) 3. Lou Williams to Montrezl Harrell ( 127 ) 4. Nikola Jokic to Jamal Murray ( 123 ) 5. Trae Young to John Collins ( 119 ) \u2022 Young and Collins have played only 915 minutes together , so those 119 assists translate to 4.68 per 36 minutes, just a hair behind the 4.70 per 36 from James to Davis. \u2022 Jokic has 123 assists to Murray, and Murray has 107 assists to Jokic , making this the second straight season when they\u2019ve been the only pair with at least 100 assists to each other. Other combinations with at least 60 assists going in both directions: Bam Adebayo and Kendrick Nunn (65 and 63), Jokic and Will Barton (72 and 62), and Evan Fournier and Nikola Vucevic (73 and 60). THE STAT Ben McLemore has taken 470 field goal attempts \u2026 without one coming from mid-range (between the paint and the 3-point line). THE CONTEXT This one is on the quirky side, but still noteworthy. The player with the second-most total field goal attempts without a single mid-range attempt is Bulls rookie Daniel Gafford, who has taken all 134 of his shots in the paint. In the 24 seasons for which we have shot-location data, only two other players have at least 100 field goal attempts without a single one from mid-range: \u2022 Ed Davis, who took all 142 of his shots in the paint with the Blazers in 2016-17. \u2022 Gary Clark, who, with the Rockets last season, took 13 of his 151 shots in the paint and the other 138 from 3-point range. McLemore has taken more than three times as many shots as any of those other guys, without ever taking a shot with his toes on the line or pulling up from just outside the paint. The discipline! ADDITIONAL NOTES \u2022 Of the 229 players who have attempted at least 300 shots, Rudy Gobert has the second lowest percentage of shots coming from mid-range ( 2-of-506 ). Four more centers follow Gobert, with Cody Zeller the only one who\u2019s attempted more than nine shots from outside the paint (75 of his 80 shots from the outside have been 3-point attempts). \u2022 Of the 183 players who have attempted at least 200 shots from outside the paint, the ones with the highest ratios of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts are McLemore (infinity), James Harden (48.1), Duncan Robinson (38.8), Svi Mykhailiuk (35.6) and Trevor Ariza (34.5). Three more Rockets (Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon and Danuel House Jr.) are in the top 10. \u2022 There are 12 players who have taken at least 200 shots from outside the paint with more mid-range attempts than 3-point attempts. They are led by DeMar DeRozan (11 times as many mid-range attempts as 3-point attempts), LaMarcus Aldridge (2.2), Domantas Sabonis (2.1), Dejounte Murray (1.7) and Russell Westbrook (1.4). \u2022 Westbrook accounts for 274 (77%) of the Rockets\u2019 357 mid-range attempts . THE STAT Jimmy Butler has an effective field goal percentage of 33.8% on shots from outside the paint, the worst mark (by a wide margin) among 183 players who have taken at least 200 shots from the outside. THE CONTEXT Butler\u2019s issues from the outside have been three-pronged: 1. Butler is one of those 12 players (noted above) with at least 200 attempts from outside the paint and more mid-range attempts than 3-point attempts, so he\u2019s not maximizing his points per attempt. 2. Butler has shot 49-for-158 (31.0%) from mid-range, the second-worst mark among 79 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts. 3. Butler has shot 29-for-117 (24.8%) from 3-point range, the third-worst mark among 242 players with at least 100 3-point attempts. Butler\u2019s poor shooting has extended to clutch situations. On shots when the score is within five points during the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, he has an effective field goal percentage of 30.8%, the worst mark among 71 players with at least 30 attempts. He\u2019s 14-for-40 (35%) on clutch 2-pointers and 3-for-20 (15%) on clutch 3-pointers, the second-worst mark among 40 players who have attempted at least 20. Butler is tied (with Zach LaVine) for the league lead with 15 field goal attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime \u2026 and he\u2019s made just one of those 15 shots. But Butler ranks 46th in true shooting percentage, which measures overall scoring efficiency, among 137 players with at least 500 total field goal attempts at 58.3% (the league average is 56.4%). While Butler has shot poorly from the perimeter, he has taken just 38% of his shots \u2014 the lowest rate of his career \u2014 from outside the paint. And while he hasn\u2019t shot as well in the paint as he had during the previous few seasons, his 55.8% this season ranks a tick above the league average. He\u2019s scored 1.40 points per possession in transition, the second-best mark among 101 players who have averaged at least two transition possessions per game. Drawing fouls is a big component of Butler\u2019s efficiency, in transition and otherwise. He has gotten to the line for a career-high 9.1 free throw attempts per game. He has a free throw rate of 67.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field, the second-highest rate among 229 players with at least 300 field goal attempts (trailing only Rudy Gobert) and up from 40.4 last season. That\u2019s the biggest jump among 200 players with at least 250 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons. On the other end of the floor, Butler is one of two players (Memphis\u2019 Tyus Jones is the other) that have played at least 750 minutes and have more steals (92) than personal fouls (74). And despite poor perimeter shooting from both Butler and Derrick Jones Jr. (who ranks third-worst in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage, league-worst in corner 3-point percentage), the Heat are tied for the league lead in 3-point percentage (38.3%), as well as rank third offensively vs. the league\u2019s top 10 defenses (110.6 points scored per 100 possessions in 24 games), and have had the league\u2019s second-most improved offense overall, scoring 5.5 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season. THE STAT James Harden has made 27 more 3-pointers (271) and 138 more free throws (619) than any other player. THE CONTEXT This is the sixth straight season in which Harden has made at least 200 3s and 600 free throws. Only two other players have ever done it: Gilbert Arenas with the Wizards in the \u201906-07 season ) and Russell Westbrook (Thunder, \u201916-17), who nailed exactly 200 3s to make the cut. Agent Zero was ahead of his time. Arenas also came one 3-pointer shy of the 200\/600 Club in \u201905-06. Isaiah Thomas (245 3PM, 590 FTM; Celtics, \u201916-17 ) and Kevin Durant (192, 703; Thunder, \u201913-14 ) have also come close. These days, reaching 600 made free throws is tougher than the 200 made 3s. Over the last five seasons (including this one), there have been 50 instances of a player making at least 200 3s, but only six of a player making at least 600 free throws (Harden five times and Westbrook in \u201916-17). To get to 600 free throws made, you have to average exactly eight in 75 games. Before the season was suspended, Hawks All-Star Trae Young had already eclipsed the 200 3-pointer mark while averaging 8.02 made free throws \u2014 though he had missed exactly seven of the Hawks\u2019 67 games. Expect Young, and maybe fellow sophomore Luka Doncic, to join the James Harden Club at some point in the future. THE STAT The Hawks have doled out 53% of their minutes to rookies or second-year players, the league\u2019s highest rate. Rookies are getting 27% (2nd overall) and second-year players, 26% (3rd). THE CONTEXT The Hawks\u2019 record stands at 20-47, not far off last season\u2019s 29-53 showing, despite ranking as one of the league\u2019s most improved teams after the All-Star break last year. But they\u2019re still very young and have actually recorded the league\u2019s seventh-biggest drop in point differential per 100 possessions, from -5.5 last season (26th overall) last season to -7.4 ( 28th overall ) this season. Having first or second-year players log more than half a team\u2019s minutes isn\u2019t particularly unique. The Hawks are the 10th team in the last 10 seasons to do so. And there\u2019s promise in the improvement most of the other nine have seen the following season: The previous nine teams that distributed more than half of their minutes from rookies or second-year players have an average improvement of 3.3 points per 100 possessions. The \u201916-17 Lakers obviously added LeBron James in the summer, but still kept a young core that showed some improvement. ADDITIONAL NOTES \u2022 The Hornets (48%) rank second in the percentage of their minutes distributed to rookies or second-year players. They\u2019re followed by the Grizzlies (43%), Wizards (39%) and Warriors (37%). \u2022 The Lakers rank last, at 0.1% ( 15 total minutes from Kostas Antetokounmpo, Talen Horton-Tucker and Zach Norvell Jr.). They\u2019re followed by the Jazz (1%), Nuggets (5% \u2014 much to the chagrin of Michael Porter Jr. fans), Rockets (5%) and Spurs (7%). \u2022 Those are all Western Conference teams, of course. In total, rookies or second-year players have accounted for a little more than 25% of the minutes on Eastern Conference teams and a little less than 20% in the more veteran-laden West. \u2022 Twelve of the 16 teams that have distributed more than 20% of their minutes to rookies or second-year players are non-playoff teams, with the exceptions being the Grizzlies, Heat (35%, 8th), Thunder (31%, 10th) and Celtics (24%, 15th). Twelve of the 14 teams that have distributed fewer than 20% of their minutes to rookies or second-year players are playoff teams, with the exceptions being the Kings (8%, 25th) and Spurs (7%, 26th). THE STAT The league has averaged 109.9 points per 100 possessions this season. THE CONTEXT This ranks as the most efficient season in the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data and, likely, in NBA history. It would surpass last season\u2019s mark of 109.7 points per 100 possessions. Compared to last season, turnovers are up, offensive rebounding is down, and the free throw rate is down a tick. But the most important thing in this league is shooting, and league-wide eFG% has hit an all-time high for the fifth straight season. From 2014-15, it\u2019s risen from 49.6% toward this season\u2019s mark of 52.8%. Standard field goal percentage is 46.0%, down slightly from 46.1% last season. But teams are getting more value from their shots, and not just because the percentage of shots that have come from 3-point range has risen for a ninth straight season (up from 22.2% in 2010-11 all the way to 38.2% this season). League-wide 2-point percentage has also reached an all-time high at 52.3%, in part because the percentage of 2-point shots that have come in the restricted area \u2014 the area of the floor that produces the most points per attempt \u2014 has also risen for a ninth straight season (from 40.5% in 2010-11 to 52.3%). Mid-range shots have accounted for just 13% of all field goal attempts, down from 38% 20 seasons ago. Also, while free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) is down slightly, the league has shot 77.1% from the line, the third-best mark in NBA history and up from 76.6% last season. If we get more regular-season games and offense struggles after a long hiatus, 2019-20 could slip from its current status as the most efficient season in league history. But it would be a small price to pay to have hoops back in our lives. John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert and guard Donovan Mitchell both confirmed they were positive for the coronavirus on March 11 via posts on social media. Those two, as well as the rest of the Jazz\u2019s roster and personnel, were cleared by the Utah Department of Health on Friday, the team said in a statement . \u201cThe UDOH has determined that all Jazz players and staff, including two who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, no longer pose a risk of infection to others,\u201d wrote Aaron Falk on UtahJazz.com. Shortly after the news became official, Mitchell posted on Twitter with a praying hands emoji. Per the team\u2019s official website, Jazz players and staff will continue to practice distancing while limiting time outside of their home to essential activities, in accordance with recommendations by the NBA and the Centers for Disease Control. Mitchell was on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on March 16 and said he was asymptomatic of coronavirus, showing no symptoms or signs of the virus. He had been in quarantine ever since the diagnosis. Pistons big man Christian Wood \u2014 who matched up against Gobert in Utah\u2019s March 7 road win \u2014 reportedly tested positive for coronavirus as well. However, Wood is also reportedly showing signs of full recovery . In a video posted on March 15 via the NBA, Gobert said he was \u201cfeeling a little better every single day.\u201d He also expressed remorse in his social media post, writing, \u201cI have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment. The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.\u201d Before leaving a media session at shootaround in Salt Lake City on March 7 in advance of a game against Detroit that night, Gobert touched all the tape recorders that were placed before him on a table, devices that reporters who cover the Jazz were using. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s not much we can do right now,\u201d Gobert said in that session when asked about how teams are dealing with the virus. And a minute or so later, before he ran out a side door, he touched all the recorders. Per UtahJazz.com, the players have been in close contact \u2014 and in good spirits \u2014 during the NBA\u2019s season hiatus. \u201cWe have a Jazz group chat that\u2019s always blowing up,\u201d forward Joe Ingles told the site."},{"id":28094,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-salary-reductions-top-nba-executives","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Report: Salary reductions for top NBA executives","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Top NBA executives are having their base salaries reduced by 20% for the foreseeable future, a person with knowledge of the details said Thursday. The reductions affect the roughly 100 highest-earning executives, as the NBA joins the NHL and NASCAR in cutting salaries while competitions are on hold because of the coronavirus. The cuts are effective immediately and affect NBA employees both inside the league headquarters in New York, and in global offices, the person told The Associated Press . The person was granted anonymity because the reductions were not announced publicly. The reductions were first reported by ESPN . Health benefits remain unaffected and there are no changes for the rest of the organization, including support and administrative staff. The NBA suspended its season on March 11 when Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz became the first player to test positive. The league is still discussing scenarios for resuming play once allowed. It had already been a challenging season for the NBA financially, with a loss of revenue from China following Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of Hong Kong anti-government protesters. Games were taken off the air and relationships with business partners were damaged, with Commissioner Adam Silver saying during last month\u2019s All-Star Game that the league could lose hundreds of millions of dollars. Then came the coronavirus, which for most people causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover. The pandemic has caused a huge impact on sports leagues. The NHL is cutting salaries for league employees 25% starting next month. NASCAR officers will have a 25% reduction in salary, while all other employees will have their salary reduced by 20%. NBA executives have given up salary before, with former Commissioner David Stern taking no pay during work stoppages in 1998 and 2011. NBA teams will make their next scheduled salary payments to players April 1, but it remains unclear if they will get what would be their next check April 15. The league could say the pandemic falls under what is legally known as a \u201cForce Majeure Event\u201d \u2014 the term for unforeseeable circumstances, such as war or an epidemic. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, when that clause is invoked, players could lose 1.08% of their annual salary for each game missed. That means Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, the league\u2019s highest-paid player this season, could lose about $435,000 for each game that ultimately is not played. A player who had a two-way contract converted to a regular NBA deal for this season would stand to lose about $9,700 per game. However, none of that would become finalized until such time as the league officially cancels games. That has not yet occurred. * * * AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami contributed to this story. * * *"},{"id":28069,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fred-curly-neal-harlem-globetrotters-dies-ap","date":"2020-03-26","title":"Harlem Globetrotters great Curly Neal dies at 77","content":" (AP) \u2014 Fred \u201cCurly\u201d Neal, the dribbling wizard who entertained millions with the Harlem Globetrotters for parts of three decades, has died.

He is reporting that Wood was cleared from COVID-19 today after registering a negative test result for the virus on Wednesday. In order to be cleared for coronavirus, one must have two negative tests, spaced at least 24 hours apart, to reach that designation. Wood would be the first known NBA player to be cleared from coronavirus after testing positive for it two weeks ago. Rod Beard of The Detroit News reported Wednesday night that Wood was almost fully cleared after he passed his initial test on Wednesday and would have a second test Thursday, per the newspaper .

My first reaction to her was to go seek medical attention immediately. There\u2019s no reason to wait, just go to the nearest hospital. And after a couple days of not showing any signs of improvement, I was very adamant on the first day to go to a hospital and seek further evaluation. \u201cSpecifically, my sister told her she needs to get checked for corona.

I knew there was more days to come, but I felt that we were heading in the right direction. They said that she went sideways and things had went sideways quick.

The International Olympic Committee said the Tokyo Games \u201cmust be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.\u201d It was an announcement seen as all but a certainty as pressure mounted from nervous athletes, sports organizations and national Olympic committees \u2014 all forced to deal with training and qualifying schedules, to say nothing of international anti-doping protocols, that have been ruptured beyond repair. Four-time Olympic hockey champion Hayley Wickenheiser, the first IOC member to criticize the body\u2019s reluctance to postpone, called it the \u201cmessage athletes deserved to hear.\u201d \u201cTo all the athletes: take a breath, regroup, take care of yourself and your families. Your time will come,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. IOC President Thomas Bach and Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo met via phone Tuesday morning, and they, along with a handful of executives from the IOC and Japan\u2019s organizing committee, agreed to make the call to delay games that have been reported to cost upward of $28 billion to stage. Other Olympics \u2014 1916, 1940 and 1944 \u2014 have been canceled because of war, but none have ever been postponed for any reason, let alone a renegade virus that has accounted for more than 375,000 cases worldwide, with numbers growing exponentially. The Tokyo Games would still be called the 2020 Olympics, even though they will be held in 2021 \u2014 the first time the games will be held in an odd-numbered year since the modern era began in 1896. \u201cThe leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. The decision offers a sense of relief for the 11,000-or-so potential Olympians from more than 200 countries, who no longer have to press forward with training under near-impossible conditions, unsure of when, exactly, they need to be ready \u2014 and for what. \u201cThankful to finally have some clarity regarding The Olympic Games. A huge decision but I think the right one for sure,\u201d British sprinter Adam Gemili said on Twitter. \u201cTime to regain, look after each other during this difficult period and go again when the time is right!\u201d One reason the IOC took longer to make the decision was because it wanted to figure out logistics. It will be a daunting challenge. Many of the arenas, stadiums and hotels are under contract for a games held from July 24-August 7. Remaking those arrangements is doable, but will come at a cost. There are also considerations beyond the price tag of the Games. Among them: The $1 billion-plus the IOC was to receive from NBC, the millions in smaller athlete endorsement contracts that are now in limbo, the budgets of the individual national Olympic committees, to name a few. There\u2019s also the matter of the international sports schedule. Virtually all 33 sports on the Olympic program have key events, including world championships, on the docket for 2021. Perhaps the best example of what a disruption this can cause would come from track. Famous Hayward Field at University of Oregon was rebuild and expanded at the cost of $200 million to hold next year\u2019s world championships. Now that event will likely be postponed. \u201cThere are a lot of pieces of a huge and very difficult jigsaw puzzle,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach said. But for weeks, it was becoming increasingly clear that pressing on with a July 24 starting date was no longer a choice. Virtually every sport across the globe has suspended play in the wake of the pandemic. The worldwide economy is faltering and people are increasingly being told it\u2019s not safe to congregate in large groups or, in some cases, even to leave their houses. Gyms are closed across America. Holding Olympic trials in a matter of months was becoming a virtual impossibility. Olympic committees in Canada and Australia were saying they either would not, or could not, send a team to Tokyo in July. World Athletics and the three biggest sports in the United States \u2014 swimming, track and gymnastics \u2014 were calling for a postponement. As recently as Sunday, the IOC was saying it would take up to four weeks to reach a decision. Four weeks ended up being two days. The decision came only a few hours after local organizers said the torch relay would start as planned on Thursday. It was expected to start in northeastern Fukushima prefecture, but with no torch, no torchbearers and no public. Those plans also changed. The flame will be stored and displayed in Fukushima. Like everything else in the Olympic world, it\u2019s next move will be determined at a later date. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for the athletes,\u2019 Bob Bowman, who used to coach Michael Phelps and now works with other Olympic hopefuls, told The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about at the end of the day, and really the world that gets to share in their journey and be a part of it. Now we can have a real Olympics that is healthy and fair.\u201d"},{"id":28060,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-ballmer-buy-forum-clearing-way-new-arena-ap","date":"2020-03-25","title":"Ballmer to buy Forum, clearing way for new Clippers arena","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is buying the Forum for $400 million, ending the billionaire\u2019s legal fight with the Madison Square Garden Company and clearing the way to build a new arena for his NBA team down the street in Inglewood, California. Ballmer announced his cash purchase of the venerated arena Tuesday. Ballmer, the former Microsoft executive, and Clippers vice chairman Dennis Wong are making the transaction through CAPSS LLC, a newly formed entity that will continue to operate the Forum as a live music venue. \u201cThis is an unprecedented time, but we believe in our collective future,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cWe are committed to our investment in the City of Inglewood, which will be good for the community, the Clippers and our fans.\u201d Apparently fearing competition for concerts and other big events, MSG has been aggressively attempting to thwart Ballmer\u2019s desire to build a state-of-the-art, 18,000-seat home for the Clippers just a few blocks down Prairie Avenue from the Forum. The two arenas would be separated only by the lavish SoFi Stadium complex being built by Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke. MSG, which bought the Forum for a reported $23.5 million in 2012, has sued the Inglewood city government, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature in its various attempts to slow the approval process for Ballmer\u2019s privately financed arena project, which is currently undergoing environmental review. The Forum purchase abruptly wraps up the litigation fight and allows the Clippers to move ahead on their goal to open a new arena when their Staples Center lease expires in 2024. The Clippers currently share the downtown arena with the Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL\u2019s Los Angeles Kings. Ballmer wants to build a $1.2 billion arena on 28 acres of land just south of the SoFi Stadium complex. The addition of the Clippers\u2019 new project would put four significant arenas \u2014 SoFi Stadium contains a 6,000-seat performance venue in addition to the main football stadium \u2013within one mile of each other on Prairie Avenue. Ballmer said the Forum and the Clippers\u2019 new arena will be able to coordinate event schedules while under the same ownership, mitigating the impact of so many people in such a small area of the Los Angeles suburbs. Chris Meany, a principal in the development company overseeing the Clippers\u2019 new arena project, acknowledged the importance of traffic management in the deal. \u201cWhile we have gone to great lengths to provide an unprecedented traffic-management plan for the new basketball arena, this acquisition provides a much greater ability to coordinate and avoid scheduling events at the same time at both venues,\u201d he said. MSG revitalized the once-Fabulous Forum, which had fallen into disuse after the Lakers and Kings left for Staples Center in 1999. The building was famously home to the glitzy \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers, who won five championships and reached eight NBA Finals during the 1980s. Kobe Bryant began his 20-year Lakers career in the arena. MSG spent a reported $50 million on renovations to the arena and re-opened it as a well-regarded venue primarily used for major concerts and combat sports."},{"id":28113,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/newly-formed-group-purchase-forum-official-release","date":"2020-03-24","title":"Newly formed CAPSS LLC to purchase The Forum in Inglewood","content":" CAPSS LLC has reached an agreement with The Madison Square Garden Company ( NYSE: MSG) to purchase The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., which will continue to operate as one of the premier live-music venues in the United States. The formation of CAPSS LLC and the acquisition of the Forum were driven by LA Clippers Chairman Steve Ballmer and LA Clippers Vice Chairman Dennis Wong. By reaching an agreement with MSG, CAPSS LLC will acquire the Inglewood venue, simultaneously resolving litigation surrounding plans for the new NBA arena. As part of the agreement, all of MSG\u2019s current Forum employees will be extended employment offers by the new owner. This transaction, which remains subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the second calendar quarter of 2020. CAPSS LLC is purchasing The Forum for $400 million in cash. The new Clippers arena project would be a privately financed, state-of-the-art, 18,000-seat basketball arena, team headquarters complex and community center located on West Century Boulevard between South Prairie Avenue and South Yukon Avenue. The project is currently undergoing an environmental review by the City of Inglewood. Public hearings to approve the project are expected to be held later this summer. \u201cThis is an unprecedented time, but we believe in our collective future,\u201d said Ballmer. \u201cWe are committed to our investment in the City of Inglewood, which will be good for the community, the Clippers, and our fans.\u201d Having The Forum and the new Clippers arena under the same ownership will allow for coordinated programming between the two venues, improving traffic congestion around basketball games and concerts. \u201cWe know traffic is something that many Inglewood residents worry about.

The L.A. Clippers\u2019 new arena will create an estimated 7,500 high-paying construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs once the complex is open. In addition to the economic and civic benefits, the Clippers have proposed a $100 million package of community benefits."},{"id":28135,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/auburn-isaac-okoro-draft-feature","date":"2020-03-24","title":"Auburn forward Isaac Okoro not about to back down from challenge of NBA","content":"Nine seconds remained in Auburn\u2019s game at state-rival South Alabama last November, and the Tigers, not far removed from their appearance in the 2019 Final Four, were trailing 69-68. J\u2019Von McCormick\u2019s missed 3-pointer from the right corner fell short and was scooped up by Samir Doughty, who appeared trapped by a defender. He faked a pass to the perimeter, had the presence of mind to drive the baseline, spotted freshman Isaac Okoro under the basket and whipped the ball to him. But there was one problem. Or rather, four problems. Four fifths of South Alabama\u2019s team had converged on Okoro. Undaunted, he jumped, pumped once and tossed the ball into the basket with 1.3 seconds to play as the Tigers escaped with a hard-earned win. Okoro was immediately christened with a new nickname. Ice. That game continued Okoro\u2019s auspicious college basketball debut. He scored 15 points, his third consecutive double-figure scoring game for then-3-0 Auburn, and also contributed six rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. \u201cWe had No. 23,\u201d Auburn coach Bruce Pearl told the media after the game. \u201cNo. 23 is pretty good. He\u2019s not afraid. He\u2019s productive. He plays the game on both ends of the floor and obviously made a big basket late.\u201d Pearl probably wasn\u2019t thinking much about the NBA Draft that night, but as it turned out, Okoro\u2019s first three games and that clutch game-winner were indicative of what the freshman would provide the rest of the season for the Tigers, who ended up 25-6 and ranked No. 20 in the country and were poised for another deep NCAA tournament run, before the coronavirus pandemic shut it down. Scouts couldn\u2019t help but notice, too, that the solidly built (6-foot-6, 225 pounds) wing was more than willing to take on any defensive challenge, and the way Pearl plays, that could mean checking a point guard one possession and a post man the next. Thus, it was no surprise when, on March 20, Okoro became the second presumptive lottery pick from the Southeastern Conference \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Anthony Edwards was the other \u2014 to declare for the NBA Draft. Okoro hasn\u2019t yet hired an agent. Just a day before, Pearl told NBA.com Okoro was \u201cstrongly considering,\u201d staying in the Draft, based on his projections. Pearl learned long ago Okoro could live up to projections. Heading into this season, Auburn had some serious holes to fill from the Final Four team, including small forward Chuma Okeke, a 2019 first-round pick of the Orlando Magic, and guards Bryce Brown and Jared Harper. Okoro would have a chance to assume an immediate role. Several immediate roles, in fact. \u201cHe has a chance to be the best defender in college basketball,\u201d Pearl said last summer. \u201cHis matchup is not scoring. That\u2019s just like, that guy\u2019s night\u2019s over. He can guard any position. He can guard one through five. He is quick enough to keep a guard in front of him. He is strong enough to guard any center.\u201d Pearl\u2019s preview of Okoro was accurate. In earning second-team All-SEC honors, Okoro was one of just three players in the league, along with Tennessee\u2019s John Fulkerson and Mississippi State\u2019s Reggie Perry, to average at least 12 points and pile up at least 25 steals and 25 blocked shots. As Pearl said, if the Tigers needed an opponent\u2019s leading scorer shut down, Okoro stepped up. He delivered on the other end of the floor, too \u2014 again just as Pearl expected. Three-point shooting wasn\u2019t Okoro\u2019s forte and it remains a facet of the game he\u2019ll need to improve in the NBA, but he could get to the rim on a whim. Okoro\u2019s 51.4 FG% ranked among the top 15 freshmen in the country, and it was the highest among freshmen who made at least 15 3s (20-for-69, 29%). On a team that started four seniors, it was Okoro who became Auburn\u2019s most indispensable player. Proof of that came when Okoro missed three games in February after injuring his right hamstring in an overtime win over Alabama. Without Okoro in the lineup, the Tigers lost consecutive games to Missouri and Georgia, teams that finished in the bottom tier of the SEC standings. Speaking with the press before a home game against Tennessee, the Tigers\u2019 third without Okoro, Pearl made it clear he wasn\u2019t making excuses for those two losses. But \u2026 \u201cIsaac is incredibly valuable to us on both the offensive and defensive end,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cHis man never scores, so put him on whoever you\u2019re going to put him on at Georgia, at Missouri or against Tennessee, and that guy\u2019s not scoring. He\u2019s our best help defender, taking charges, getting vertical, ending possessions with rebounds and things like that, and then offensively he\u2019s a really tough cover, another breakdown guy that can get to the rim, and so we miss him a lot.\u201d Without Okoro, Auburn fell behind by 17 points in the second half against Tennessee before rallying to win. In that game, the Volunteers\u2019 Jordan Bowden tossed in 28 points, by far his best game in a season in which he struggled with his shot. Okoro would have been the man assigned to keep Bowden in check, and Auburn might not have had to work so hard for the win. The Tigers, who have never produced a one-and-done player, will definitely miss Okoro if he stays in the Draft. During a conference call with reporters last Friday, Pearl said Okoro will evaluate his situation before making a final decision. But Okoro, known for his work ethic, won\u2019t back away from the challenges of preparing for the NBA, and Pearl wouldn\u2019t stand in his way. \u201cHe enjoyed being here, he enjoyed school, he enjoyed his teammates, his coaches, he enjoyed the training,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cBut the circumstances as they present themselves now, where if Isaac has an opportunity to be a first-round pick and certainly has an opportunity to be in the lottery, with this draft not being as deep as next year\u2019s draft is going to be, I think it makes sense for him to absolutely become draft eligible, which he is going to and then go through the process.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Otherwise, an already-complicated situation could get even tougher for coaches and players. > IOC officially postpones Tokyo Olympics USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said Tuesday that he has \u201chit the pause button\u201d on planning for the next Olympics. Colangelo noted that there\u2019s nothing now to do besides waiting to see exactly when the games in Tokyo will be held in 2021 \u2014 and if the new schedule will conflict with the NBA schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple, isn\u2019t it? We either have NBA players or we don\u2019t,\u201d Colangelo told The Associated Press . \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll look at the other options.\u201d For now, Colangelo is committed to remain in his role through 2021. So is the coaching staff; U.S. coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs is the head coach, with assistants Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors, Lloyd Pierce of the Atlanta Hawks and Jay Wright of Villanova. But again, that\u2019s all schedule permitting. This summer\u2019s Olympics were to begin July 24, which typically is part of the NBA offseason. When the International Olympic Committee announced the postponement of this summer\u2019s games on Tuesday, a decision made because of the global coronavirus pandemic, it said the delay would last \u201cno more than one year.\u201d That wording seems to suggest the possibility of an earlier-than-usual Olympics. And if the Tokyo Games are held in April, May or June that could mean the U.S. plans change considerably. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that this is going to take place in the same timeframe next summer as it was scheduled for this summer,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that have to be done totally out of our control. We\u2019re a follower in this situation. We\u2019re dealing with the NBA, FIBA, the USOC, the International Olympic Committee, etc., etc. Here\u2019s what we have to wait for now: What are the dates? Once they set the dates, then we will go into action.\u201d USA Basketball was planning to pick the 12-man roster for the Tokyo Olympics in June. There were 44 players under consideration, and assuming the schedule means NBA players can take part in 2021 most if not all of those names will likely be on the list next year. \u201cThese are unusual times,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cAnd when they ring the bell, we\u2019ll get ourselves ready.\u201d"},{"id":28141,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-c-wright-nba-league-pass-free-preview-watchlist","date":"2020-03-23","title":"Michael C. Wright's Watchlist: 15 must-see games on NBA League Pass","content":" \u2022 Watch: NBA League Pass Free Preview of all 2019-20 games \u2022 Watch: Archive of classic games on NBA League Pass Fans lamenting the absence of hoops in the midst of the NBA\u2019s hiatus over concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic might find somewhat of a reprieve by checking out some of the content provided in the free preview of NBA League Pass .  The complimentary offering, which was announced Wednesday and ends on Apr. 22, features every game from the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons, in addition to an archive of classic games and moments around the NBA. Here\u2019s my list of 15 games worth tuning in for, starting with a lucky 13 from this season and then two more from the vault. ( Editor\u2019s note: Games below are listed in chronological order.)  Why I\u2019m watching: We all had this one circled when the NBA schedule dropped. In a highly anticipated matchup between a pair of title contenders in the same city, new LA Clipper Kawhi Leonard racked up 30 points in the season opener for both teams. During one stretch, Leonard knocked down seven consecutive buckets. The Clippers would go on to win the next two games in this series, before the Lakers finally prevailed 112-103 on Mar. 8. Nobody gets through the West without seeing one of these teams in the playoffs. Why I\u2019m watching: The last three Kia NBA MVPs all on the floor at once in James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Giannis Antetokounmpo made this one pretty appealing. But Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, would steal the show, despite watching from the bench over the final 5 minutes and 18 seconds. In the second half of a 30-point outing, Antetokounmpo helped Milwaukee transform a 16-point deficit into a six-point lead on the road by racking up 20 points, 8 rebounds and five assists in fewer than 14 minutes on the floor before fouling out. Antetokounmpo would finish with 13 rebounds and 11 assists. Why I\u2019m watching: We all saw it coming, just not this soon. In his first NBA victory, Ja Morant produced plenty of highlight-reel plays, but his block on six-time NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving to send the game into overtime was probably the biggest. Morant reeled off 30 points, becoming just the third player in NBA history to produce a 30-point and nine-assist game within his first three outings. He scored 17 points in nine minutes in the fourth quarter to lead Memphis back from an eight-point deficit with 3:20 left to play before blocking Irving\u2019s potential go-ahead shot at the end of regulation. Morant\u2019s finale included him dishing the last-second dime to Jae Crowder for the game-winning bucket at the OT buzzer. Why I\u2019m watching: This outing proved to be a preview of what was to come for all the young guns looking to take the crown from King James. Lebron James and Luka Doncic became the oldest and youngest player in NBA history to post a 30-10-15 triple-double, but the former\u2019s team came out on top. James dished the assist on a Danny Green corner 3-pointer to force overtime, before the Lakers rolled comfortably down the stretch. James put up a season-high 39 points to go with 16 assists and 10 rebounds while Doncic scored 31 points in addition to dishing a career-high 15 assists and 13 rebounds.  Why I\u2019m watching: In the moment, admittedly, I laughed when Austin Rivers trolled his father, Doc, as he was ejected from this game with the Rockets comfortably leading at the Toyota Center. Once we got to the locker room, more comedy ensued because you could see just how much Austin Rivers enjoyed that moment headed into Thanksgiving, but most importantly, the victory. Harden lit up the Clippers for 47 points, marking his fifth outing with 40-plus points and five assists or more within the first 11 games of the season, an NBA record. Why I\u2019m watching: As you know, more records would fall. But in this one, Doncic scored a career-high 42 points to go with 12 assists and 11 rebounds to join LeBron as the only players in league history younger than 21 to record a 40-point triple double. The loss marked San Antonio\u2019s sixth in a row, representing its longest skid since the 2010-11 season. Why I\u2019m watching: In the 76ers\u2019 first home Christmas game in 31 years, Joel Embiid outdueled Giannis Antetokounmpo with 31 points and 11 rebounds. Too bad Embiid and the 76ers haven\u2019t been able to maintain any level of consistency. When the NBA suspended the season, Philadelphia had lost 5 of its last 10 outings. Why I\u2019m watching: Chris Paul, aka Chris Clutch, poured in 20 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter and overtime. Paul outscored Brooklyn 12-11 in clutch time as the Thunder outscored the Nets 28-13 in the final 13 minutes of regulation and OT. Paul tied the game with 47.4 seconds left in regulation, and then contributed 4 of Oklahoma City\u2019s 10 points in OT.  Why I\u2019m watching: Dame Time strikes on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with the Portland Trail Blazer setting a franchise record with 61 points, including a career-best 11 3-pointers. The performance marked the seventh time in the regular season he would score more than 50 points. But over the next two weeks, he\u2019d follow it with 48 and 51 points in back-to-back wins. Why I\u2019m watching: What a long, long day and night this was. On the Uber ride from the airport to the hotel the conversation focused solely on Zion Williamson. Same thing upon arriving at the hotel in New Orleans, where the woman checking me in screamed, \u201cZioooooonnnn!\u201d when she found out where I was headed later that night. Williamson\u2019s debut was definitely worth the wait . The man put together a magical 3 minutes and 8 seconds of brilliance in the fourth quarter, scoring 17 points in a row. Williamson also became the only player to hit 4-of-4 from 3-point range in his NBA debut, according to Elias Stats Bureau. Why I\u2019m watching: Harden lost the opening tipoff as Houston unveiled a starting lineup with nobody taller than 6-foot-6. Still, the Rockets prevailed in the debut of their first real experiment with their polarizing small-ball lineup. Westbrook led Houston with 41 points, while Robert Covington hit a couple of late clutch 3\u2019s in his Rockets debut against a huge Lakers squad. Why I\u2019m watching: King James humbled yet another young star in Williamson by scoring a season-high 40 points. But James made sure to credit Williamson , who also put on a show , scoring 29 points in 33 minutes of action. The teams would meet again in March with the Lakers coming away with a 122-114 win. This series seemed like a preview of a potential playoff matchup between the first and eighth seeds. Why I\u2019m watching: The joy Stephen Curry competes with is what we all missed with him sitting out 58 games due to a broken left hand. But on this night, that joy was finally back . In his first game in almost four months, Curry scored 23 points to go with six rebounds and seven assists in 27 minutes on the floor. \u2022 Watch: NBA League Pass Free Preview of all 2019-20 games * * *  Why I\u2019m watching: As we spend more time at home with our families practicing social distancing, it\u2019s always surprising to learn just how much your children know. My 11-year-old son spent about an hour Sunday working to create a player on the Xbox One game NBA2K20. Asked what he was doing, he said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to recreate Spud Webb.\u201d What? How does he know who Spud Webb is? Anyway, I was about a year younger than my son when the 5-foot-7 Webb wowed the crowd at Reunion Arena in his hometown of Dallas to defeat defending champion and Atlanta Hawks teammate Dominique Wilkins. Webb flushed an impressive array of dunks in this one that earned him three perfect scores, including two in the finals. At the time, Webb said Wilkins had never seen him dunk before. Why I\u2019m watching: You\u2019ve seen the iconic image of an emotional Michael Jordan tightly embracing the Larry O\u2019Brien NBA Championship Trophy. Now, you\u2019ve got a chance to relive all that it took to get it. Jordan shook off seven years of frustration in helping the Bulls roll to a 15-2 record in that postseason. Unanimously voted MVP of the series Chicago won 4-1, Jordan put together a 30-point, 10-assist performance to best a Lakers Big Three composed of Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Vlade Divac to capture the first of six titles. They often say the first is the sweetest. \u2022 Watch: Archive of classic games on NBA League Pass * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

I\u2019m an All-Star Game junkie (including last month\u2019s spectacular Elam Ending affair) and I\u2019m here for all debuts, whether it\u2019s rookies or free-agent faces in new places and more. In an attempt to manage the process, I\u2019ve come up with my own watchlist of 20 games that include games from 2019-20 and some classic games as well. ( Editor\u2019s note: Games below are listed in chronological order.) * * *  Why I\u2019m watching: They come in threes, right? Third night of the season. TNT\u2019s third blockbuster matchup of opening week. And the last three Kia MVPs (Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and Russell Westbrook) sharing the floor. This game had must-watch written all over it the moment the schedule was released \u2014 and it certainly lived up to the hype. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d spoiled Westbrook\u2019s Houston debut with a 30-point, 13-rebound, 11-assist triple-double, kicking off an encore MVP season that rolled the rest of the season. Westbrook was his relentless self (24 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists), giving the world a glimpse of the whirlwind that was to come after the Rockets worked out the inevitable chemistry hiccups that accompany the sort of blockbuster trade the Rockets pulled off in the summer to reunite Westbrook and Harden. Why I\u2019m watching: I pleaded with my wife\u2019s friends to plan her surprise birthday party for another night. I was anticipating a fireworks show from LeBron James and the Lakers\u2019 first visit to Dallas in a showdown with Luka Doncic and his crew. I knew I\u2019d be eyeballing my phone throughout the night. When I found out the location for the party was a nearby Dave & Buster\u2019s (complete with a giant, 40-foot wall TV), I realized how much trouble I was going to be in after the party. Our group moved on from dinner to games and other fun \u2026 well, everyone except me. I couldn\u2019t pull myself away from the game. LeBron (39 points, 12 rebounds, 16 assists) and Luka (31, 13 and 15) put on the MVP duel I expected and it turned out to be an official coming out party for the Mavericks superstar. It was also affirmation from LeBron that the Lakers were going be the championship team everyone expected after they traded for Anthony Davis. The wife is still exacting her revenge, by the way. My honey-do list is 33 pages long. Why I\u2019m watching: It\u2019s not often an All-Star starter goes off for 37 points (on 10-for-16 shooting, 5-for-9 on 3-pointers and 12-for-13 from the free-throw line) and no one cares. Such was the fate of Hawks guard Trae Young on this night, when his Rockets counterpart James Harden smashed the Hawks for 60 points in just 31 minutes. As mind-boggling as that sounds, Harden did so in shooting 16-for-24 overall, 8-for-14 on 3-pointers and 20-for-23 at the free-throw line. His eight assists, three rebounds and three steals were just icing on a wicked night for the league\u2019s most prolific scorer as he sent the Hawks to their 10th straight loss. Why I\u2019m watching: I\u2019m an \u201980s baby, so I have a strange preoccupation\/affinity for the Heat\u2019s \u201cVice City\u201d uniforms and court. Anytime they play in those classic uniforms, I\u2019m prone to watching for the sheer nostalgia of it all. It helps to have Jimmy Butler going at his former team (his free throws served as the dagger in overtime for the home team). I\u2019d already been down to Miami to see if this iteration of the Heat was an early-season novelty act or the real thing. Upon inspection, it was obvious that coach Erik Spoelstra\u2019s crew \u2014 even with newbies and youngsters like Bam Adebayo (All-Star), Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson playing crucial roles \u2014 forged a team that turned out to be the genuine item. In fact, they looked more like the team the Sixers were supposed to be than the Sixers themselves. Why I\u2019m watching: We all have young players that we keep an eye on, watching to see if their play matches the hype or if they are progressing the way we hope as they endure the inevitable trials and tribulations that await most of them. Denver\u2019s Michael Porter Jr. has been one of those players for me from the first moment I saw his game when he was a junior in high school. He has talent, size, range on his shot \u2026 and sheer determination in fighting his way back from the back injuries that derailed his lone season at Missouri and caused him to slide on Draft night. All of that set him up for a wild redshirt rookie season. He finally got loose against the Pacers, scoring a career-high 25 points on 11-for-12 shooting to support Jamal Murray\u2019s 22-point night to help the Nuggets to victory. I\u2019m a firm believer in Porter Jr., who is the wild card for the Nuggets\u2019 future as a Western Conference contender.  Why I\u2019m watching: We waited what seemed like forever for Zion Williamson\u2019s rookie debut with the New Orleans Pelicans. We had to wait a little bit longer for the Pelicans to get their first win with Zion in uniform, and it came against the Celtics in this Sunday showcase. Zion delivered with a 21-point, 11-rebound game against an elite Celtics team that played without All-Star forward Jayson Tatum (right groin injury). But that didn\u2019t take away from the enjoyment of watching Zion go to work (in just 27 minutes) against a tough Celtics bunch on the day we lost Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and seven others in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles. Zion\u2019s performance that day was obviously overshadowed by the tragedy. But he reminded us afterward that he and every other player that took the court that day did so with a heavy heart. Why I\u2019m watching: Even when Portland is operating outside the playoff mix, as they have all this season, it\u2019s \u201cDame Time.\u201d Blazers star Damian Lillard was deep in his bag as the Jazz came to town, torching them for 51 points (including nine 3-pointers) and 12 assists. This came an night after he torched the Lakers for 48 in a win during an outlandish stretch that saw him score 40 or more points in five of his previous six games. During this run, he averaged 48.8 ppg. Against Utah, he notched his fourth straight double-double (a career best) while turning in three 50-plus point games in his last six outings. Lillard shoved his way back into the Kia MVP conversation on the strength of this run. And this game came after Lillard had earned Western Conference Player of the Week honors, when averaged 52.7 points the week before, including setting a franchise-and Martin Luther King Jr. Day-record with 61 points on Jan. 20 against his hometown Golden State Warriors. Why I\u2019m watching: Giannis and Zion\u2019s first time matching up against each other is one of the games you must see for yourself and no force on Earth would have kept me from this one. The reigning Kia MVP served notice that despite a parade of impressive performances from young Zion, there\u2019s only one true Freak on the scene right now. His 34 points, 17 rebounds, six assists and impressive denial of Zion at the rim punctuated the win for the Bucks, whose dominance everywhere they\u2019d been to that point in the season served as the most impressive regular-season run we\u2019ve seen since the 73-win Warriors of 2015-16. Both Zion (20 points, five rebounds) and All-Star swingman Brandon Ingram (32 points, seven rebounds) were up for the challenge. They just couldn\u2019t match the firepower of a Bucks squad that had been clicking on all cylinders since training camp.  Why I\u2019m watching: This was the East vs. West\/Kia MVP showdown we waited for as both the Lakers and Bucks dominated their competition \u2014 for the most part \u2014 all season long. Giannis had a death grip on the top spot in the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder for months, with LeBron secure in the second spot on the list just behind him. As momentous as it was, one head-to-head matchup between two titans was not going to be enough to shift the race dramatically \u2026 unless LeBron showed up and showed all the way out. And that\u2019s exactly what LeBron did on both ends of the floor. He got the win and also won the battle (37 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, three steals and some rugged defense) against Giannis (32, 11 and six) on both ends of the floor. They split the season series in what many people hope is a Finals preview. Why I\u2019m watching: If the Lakers\u2019 Friday showdown with the Bucks was a Finals preview, the Sunday matinee that followed against the Clippers may have foreshadowed a potential 2020 Western Conference finals matchup. The Lakers couldn\u2019t solve the Clippers in their first two matchups (opening night and Christmas) but seemed to have solved that Rubik\u2019s Cube just in time. LeBron (28 points, nine assists, eight rebounds, two blocks) and Davis (30 points, seven rebounds, two steals and a block) certainly showed the way, each of them showing up when it mattered most. But the performance to study in this game came from Avery Bradley, who played his role to perfection in this game (24 points, 6-for-12 on 3-pointers and some high-level defense). Kyle Kuzma\u2019s crowning of LeBron as he exited the game became one of great memes of this or any NBA season in recent memory. Time will tell if it was true or not.  * * * Why I\u2019m watching: It\u2019s Russell and \u201cThe Big O\u201d in their primes. Why anyone would pass up an opportunity to jump in the time machine and go back and see those two legends at work is beyond me. The NBA was a different monster back then, of course. But transcendent talents like Russell and Robertson resonate in any era. Why I\u2019m watching: That coin toss that changed NBA history for the Bucks, who won the right to select first in the 1969 draft over Phoenix, culminated in an opening-night showcase for the then most dominant young big man on the planet. The league\u2019s future all-time leading scorer kicked off his career with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists in 48 minutes in a 119-110 victory for Milwaukee. Why I\u2019m watching: In an era when the All-Star Game was far more competitive than it would be in later years, Julius Erving was the star of stars at MECCA Arena in Milwaukee. He and Bob McAdoo both scored 30 points (Dr. J\u2019s in eight fewer minutes), but the East\u2019s rally from a 10-point deficit came up short in a 125-124 loss. The bright side for Erving in the defeat? He took home that game\u2019s MVP honors. Why I\u2019m watching: It has nothing to do with my birthday being the next day and Moses Malone ruining my birthday weekend by vanquishing my Dad\u2019s beloved Los Angeles Lakers in The Finals that Saturday night. Walter A. Smith was in no mood to party back then. Malone, of course, famously predicted a \u201cfo, fo, fo\u201d run through the playoffs for the Sixers \u2014 as in sweeps in every playoff series. However, the Sixers lost Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals to Milwaukee and ended up going \u201cFo, fi, fo\u201d during their championship march. Why I\u2019m watching: Magic. Bird. Lakers. Celtics. The first Finals between these game-changers and their proud franchises was bound to go the distance. Magic finished with 21 points and 10 assists and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 30 and 10 rebounds, as the Lakers rallied from a six-point halftime deficit to control the final 15 minutes and stave off elimination (they lost Game 7 in Boston). Why I\u2019m watching: All-Star games from yesteryear satisfy every single need for me. You get a group of superstar players on one court with the right competitive tone but without the narrow two-team scope of The Finals. Since my older brother and I were in our Pistons infatuation, this turned out to be a huge All-Star weekend with Thomas winning All-Star Game MVP honors. Why I\u2019m watching: Even after living through every minute of Michael Jordan\u2019s insane career, some of his exploits still seem like urban legend. I know folks in Cleveland (Smith family included) still shake at thought of Jordan eliminating the Cavaliers from the playoffs with that iconic shot (cover your eyes, Craig Ehlo and Larry Nance). Why I\u2019m watching: Fans outside of Chicago had come to grips with the fact that it was Jordan\u2019s world. He owned the stage this time of year and it was just a matter of how he wanted to write the ending to each season. Airing out the Trail Blazers from deep, though with six first-half 3-pointers and his famous \u201cshrug\u201d \u2026 this dude was unreal!  Why I\u2019m watching: I\u2019m covering the league by now and have seen up close and personal just how devastating Kobe could be when stars are cooking. It was a nine-game night and the team I was covering, the Hawks, had the night off. This is pre-social media, of course, so it\u2019s not like you followed along with every game the way we do now. I remember watching the highlights over and over again as they featured every shot he made on that historic night. It was crazy! Why I\u2019m watching: It\u2019s hard to count the number of electric playoff games I\u2019ve been present for over the years, but this ranks right up near the top of the list. NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell and I were seated three rows from the court in the media section behind one of the baskets at Staples Center, witnessing what we thought might go down as one of ugliest Game 7s by a superstar in NBA history. Kobe had a brutal shooting night (6-for-24) but willed his Lakers (with a huge rescue job by Pau Gasol and postgame media darling Ron Artest\/Metta World Peace) to a revenge win over the Celtics. An absolutely epic night in an atmosphere that\u2019s hard to match, especially given the shared history of the two franchises. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

(AP) \u2014 Duke sophomore Tre Jones says he will enter the NBA draft. The point guard was named to the third team of The Associated Press All-America team on Friday after being named Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year by the league and runner-up for the same award from the AP . Jones averaged 16.2 points and 6.4 assists for the Blue Devils, the highlight being his buzzer-beating shot off his own intentionally missed free throw to force overtime in a wild comeback win at North Carolina on Feb. 8. In a statement released by the school Saturday, Jones said his goal was to win a national championship and he had thought about \u201cwhat if\u201d in light of the NCAA Tournament being canceled due to the spread of the coronavirus. But Jones said he appreciated \u201cthe amazing experiences and relationships\u201d from two years with the Blue Devils, who reached an NCAA regional final in his freshman year. In a statement, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski called Jones \u201cthe heart and soul of our program\u201d over his two seasons and \u201csuch a pleasure to coach.\u201d Team spokesman Mike DeGeorge said Saturday that Jones has not yet hired an agent."},{"id":28136,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-adam-silver-considering-all-options-ap","date":"2020-03-21","title":"NBA commissioner Adam Silver seeking answers, which are in short supply","content":" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver finds himself almost constantly looking at financial numbers and projections. And like the rest of a world that is dealing with the seismic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, he still isn\u2019t sure how bad things will get. Silver said Saturday the league is considering all options \u2014 best-case, worst-case and countless ideas in between \u2014 as it tries to come to grips with this new normal. But definitive answers on any front are in short supply. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell what the economic impact will be,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been analyzing multiple scenarios on a daily if not hourly basis and we\u2019ll continue to review the financial implications. Obviously, it\u2019s not a pretty picture but everyone, regardless of what industry they work in, is in the same boat.\u201d Saturday marked the 10th full day of the NBA\u2019s shutdown, a stoppage that has cost the league 75 games and counting so far, a total that will reach triple digits on Wednesday and will eventually get to 259 on April 15 \u2014 the day the regular season was supposed to end. Play isn\u2019t going to resume by then. The financial losses will be massive and will obviously just keep growing if this season cannot resume or if next season is affected. \u201cAdam is obviously cautious, cautiously optimistic,\u201d Cleveland forward Kevin Love said earlier in the week. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future holds but the NBA has been through a lot, we\u2019ve seen a lot and I think we\u2019ll be incredibly resilient. It just might take time.\u201d Players who are due to get their next paycheck on April 1 will get them. Whether those players will get their April 15 check is in some question; the league can exercise a clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that allows it to take back 1.08% of each player\u2019s salary for each game missed in certain times \u2014 like war, or in this case, a pandemic. That clause has not been exercised yet since, officially anyway, no game has been canceled. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring all options to resume our season if and when it is safe to do so,\u201d Silver said. \u201cNothing is off the table.\u201d Besides, there are other bridges to cross first. The NBA \u2014 which was the first major U.S. pro league to say it would play games without fans and the first league to suspend its season once All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive \u2014 has been extremely vocal in trying to get its massive fan base to take social distancing and other preventative measures seriously. \u201cOur focus right now is doing all that we can to support, engage and educate the general public in response to this pandemic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe are also making sure that we are prepared to resume the season if and when it becomes safe for all concerned.\u201d The league has asked teams for building availability dates through the end of August, an indicator that this season \u2014 if it resumes \u2014 may stretch deep into the summer. So far, there are 14 people within the NBA community, including at least 10 players, known to have tested positive for COVID-19. Of those positive tests, seven became known publicly on Thursday and Marcus Smart of the Boston Celtics revealed that he has the virus. \u201cUnfortunately, based on everything we know, significantly more positive cases in our league were inevitable,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo, Thursday\u2019s results did not come as a huge surprise and just like everyone else, we\u2019re just trying to take each day as it comes.\u201d For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Entering Saturday, there were about 19,000 known positive cases in the U.S. and more than 250 deaths blamed on the virus. Globally, there have been nearly 300,000 cases diagnosed so far with nearly 12,000 deaths. The virus first exploded in mainland China, where the NBA has offices and about 200 employees. What workers in China went through helped the league quickly grasp some sort of understanding of the severity. Silver made the decision to shut down the league before any public health experts advised the NBA to take that step. He even sounded the alarm publicly in mid-February at NBA All-Star weekend in Chicago \u2014 saying then it was \u201ca major national, if not global, health crisis\u201d that was taking place. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from our China office,\u201d Silver said, noting that meetings have been of the virtual variety there for several weeks now. Silver\u2019s sixth full season as commissioner of the NBA started with the league getting into a major rift with China. His mentor and NBA Commissioner emeritus David Stern died two months later. Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash less than a month after that. Now he is dealing with the biggest crisis of them all \u2014 a pandemic, affecting and threatening virtually every corner of the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging season,\u201d Silver said. \u201cFor all of us.\u201d"},{"id":28126,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-edwards-georgia-freshman-plans-enter-nba-draft-ap","date":"2020-03-21","title":"Georgia freshman Anthony Edwards announces plans to enter NBA Draft","content":" ATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Georgia freshman Anthony Edwards announced his plans to enter the NBA draft on Friday. For his coach, Tom Crean, it was only a matter of when the news would come. He knew his top scorer was ready for the next level. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there was any pros or cons to it,\u201d Crean said, adding that Edwards\u2019 decision was \u201ceasy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s pretty much assured he\u2019s going to be very, very high in that draft, if not the highest,\u201d Crean said. Edwards\u2019 spot in the next NBA draft was expected even before he played his first game for the Bulldogs. Edwards, from Holy Spirit Prep in Atlanta, was one of the nation\u2019s top recruits last season. He has been regarded as one of the top draft prospects. Edwards, a 6-foot-5 guard, led the nation\u2019s freshmen with his average of 19.1 points per game. He added 5.2 rebounds. \u201cHis desire to improve, his desire to work was incredible,\u201d Crean said. \u201cI think he\u2019s got an incredible future.\u201d Edwards announced his decision with a statement on his Twitter feed. \u201cGeorgia will always be my home but I am ready to take my game to the next level and have decided to declare for the 2020 NBA Draft,\u201d Edwards wrote. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve made you all proud but the work is far from finished. Family, friends, teammates, coaches, fans and Georgia, this one\u2019s for you. I\u2019m excited for what the future holds and I hope you\u2019ll follow along. The next chapter starts now. Let\u2019s get it.\u201d Edwards was an often explosive scorer but struggled at times with his long-range shots. He made only 29.4% of his 3-point attempts. Crean noted that Edwards\u2019 72 3-pointers led the team. Crean expects Edwards will improve in the NBA, especially as he gains more confidence in his shot. Crean said Edwards\u2019 range \u201cis excellent\u201d and said the young guard needs to take his outside shots without hesitation. \u201cHe\u2019s got to trust the catch-and-shoot shot without having to take that dribble,\u201d Crean said. \u201cThere were times in practice he was outstanding without taking that dribble.\u201d Despite Edwards\u2019 scoring leadership, Georgia was only 16-16 overall and 5-13 in the Southeastern Conference. Another freshman, 6-foot-11 center Rodney Howard, from Ypsilanti, Michigan, plans to transfer. Howard averaged 1.3 points in 24 games, including two starts."},{"id":28103,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/former-bucks-gm-john-erickson-dies","date":"2020-03-21","title":"Former Bucks GM John Erickson dies at 92","content":" LENEXA, Kansas (AP) \u2014 John Erickson, a former Milwaukee Bucks general manager and Wisconsin men\u2019s basketball coach, has died.

Edwards\u2019 6-foot-5, 225-pound frame and unique skillset belied his age, but Crean, who had coached Dwyane Wade (Marquette) and Victor Oladipo (Indiana) in his career, nevertheless had a gold standard by which he would measure the freshman. Crean knew Edwards had work to do. \u201cHe\u2019s very smart,\u201d Crean said last September. \u201cPhysically, there\u2019s no question he\u2019s got it all. But we don\u2019t want him playing the whole year on potential. Kids come in from high school where they were able to do pretty much everything they wanted. They did it in volume. We want Anthony to be efficient. Efficient and consistent. That\u2019s my job.\u201d So, did he get there? Edwards left behind a large sample size of his work. At times he was great, and at times, in part because of the defensive attention he attracted, he struggled. Scouts would have loved to get more of a look at Edwards in do-or-die situations, but like hundreds of other college players who earlier this month had just begun postseason play, he was sidelined prematurely. Edwards\u2019 final game didn\u2019t produce eye-popping numbers\u2014he scored six points on 2-for-13 shooting, including 1-for-9 from beyond the arc \u2014 but he played all 40 minutes and helped engineer an 81-63 victory over Ole Miss in the only other game played in the Southeastern Conference tournament before league officials shut it down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Edwards\u2019 final game was an interesting case study, because his plus\/minus was 18. Over the years, analytics experts have debated the usefulness of that stat, but of course they would \u2014 it\u2019s based more on intangible factors than numbers. On a night when Edwards\u2019 shot wasn\u2019t falling, Crean didn\u2019t think about taking him out of the game, and Edwards helped his team win any way he could.  \u201cIf you just judge him by his shooting numbers or his stats, you\u2019re going to miss a lot,\u201d Crean says. \u201cHe can really guard. He creates a ton of [defensive] attention for the opponent, which creates opportunities for other people. And he got so much better defensively. We were asking him to guard the other team\u2019s best player and to do it frequently.\u201d As proof of that latter point, Crean offers up some clips of Georgia\u2019s Feb. 29 game against Arkansas, during which Edwards was paired against the Razorbacks\u2019 Mason Jones, who led the SEC in scoring. \u201cHe went into full lockdown mode,\u201d Crean says. \u201cHe wants those challenges. And he\u2019ll want them in the NBA.\u201d Arkansas coach Eric Musselman came away impressed with Edwards after having finally seen him in person and not just on film. \u201cHis combination of strength, speed, his pull-up jumper off the bounce \u2014 he can just rise over people,\u201d Eric Musselman, a two-time former NBA head coach, told the media after Edwards delivered 26 points, seven rebounds and 3-for-6 3-point shooting in addition to suffocating defense on Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player with an incredibly bright future. Having coached in that league, he\u2019s got an NBA body right now. He can dribble drive in traffic at the next level, take contact, finish through contact. \u201cYou watch a guy on film and he\u2019s really good and then you watch him live, just his explosiveness. He\u2019s got NBA athleticism and NBA strength.\u201d Another SEC coach who\u2019s more than qualified to talk about Edwards is Texas A&M\u2019s Buzz Williams, who lists Jimmy Butler, Jae Crowder and Wes Matthews among the players he\u2019s sent to the NBA. \u201cI don\u2019t study it a lot, relative to if he\u2019s the first pick or the second pick,\u201d Williams said when Georgia beat the Aggies in January. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all of those things, but based on his performance today [29 points, 15 rebounds, two assists and two steals] I thought he was just incredible. I\u2019ve studied his game and his numbers. But I thought his impact on winning may have been as good as it has been all year, particularly his job on the glass. \u201cHis physicality \u2014 not just when he had the ball, but also when he was chasing after the ball. \u2026 Defensively, I thought he was engaged ball-pressure wise. I thought he did a lot of things to impact the game. I thought he was dominant in every category.\u201d Draft analysts and NBA front offices will have plenty of time before June to break down Edwards\u2019 freshman season. Two numbers that will jump out: 50.5 field-goal attempts and 245 3-point attempts in 32 games. Did his percentages (40.2% from the field and 29.4% from 3) warrant that high a volume? Edwards was simply doing what he was told. \u201cWould I have liked to have gotten him more catch-and-shoot 3s and had him trust the catch-and-shoot rather than put it on the ground?\u201d Crean says. \u201cAbsolutely. But he never had to take catch-and-shoot 3s in high school, because his ability to get downhill, get to the rim and create contact is really extraordinary.\u201d Crean thinks the next two years of Edwards\u2019 development will be critical and doesn\u2019t hesitate to list the facets of Edwards\u2019 game that can improve. \u201cI would hope he\u2019d continue to trust his jump shot without the dribble,\u201d Crean says. \u201cHe can get better at reading ball-screen situations and making plays for himself and others. He needs to continue to be held to a high standard as a rebounder. And I would hope someone would continue to implore him how good he can be defensively. Because he can be elite defensively.\u201d So, if Crean were an NBA general manager with the No. 1 pick in the Draft, would he take Edwards? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember he\u2019s very young,\u201d Crean says. \u201cHe should still be in high school. But yes, absolutely I would. He\u2019s got so much upside. There\u2019s not a doubt in my mind. If you gamble against him now, you\u2019re doing so at your own peril.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Over the past week, 18 NBA and WNBA players created public service announcement videos to share important health and wellness information about ways to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Those videos have generated more than 37 million views across the league\u2019s social media accounts. The league is using its vast digital footprint and the powerful voices of teams, players, coaches, doctors and others across the NBA family to launch \u201cNBA Together\u201d \u2013 a global community and social engagement campaign that aims to support, engage, educate and inspire youth, families and fans in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The program is centered on four pillars \u2013 Know the Facts, Acts of Caring, Expand Your Community and NBA Together Live \u2013 that will amplify the latest global health and safety information, share guidelines and resources, and keep people and communities socially connected through digital tools and virtual events as everyone copes with the impact of the pandemic. As part of NBA Together, the NBA family is committed to contributing and helping raise more than $50 million to support people impacted by the coronavirus and community and healthcare organizations providing vital services around the world, which includes the more than $30 million financial commitment already made by NBA and WNBA teams and players to date. Know the Facts This week, the NBA launched its Coronavirus Information For NBA Fans webpage , which is updated daily with content and links to provide global fans the latest information on developments in their regions and how they can best protect themselves and others from the virus. The site features resources to reduce coronavirus risk with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and local and federal health experts. The NBA and WNBA will continue to use the influential voices of players, coaches and legends through public service announcements to inform fans on the best ways to stay safe and healthy in both their body and mind as the world faces the rapidly changing and evolving pandemic. Acts of Caring The \u201cActs of Caring\u201d initiative looks to shine a light on the power of community and volunteerism by inspiring 1 million big and small acts of kindness. The NBA is calling on players, fans and the general public to share ways they are supporting friends, families and communities by posting photos and videos with the hashtag #NBATogether on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. These acts can include teaching virtual classes, buying groceries for neighbors in need or donating supplies. Visit cares.nba.com\/actsofcaring to learn more.

This includes the launch of \u201c Jr. NBA at Home ,\u201d a new interactive content series for young people who are currently unable to play with their friends and teammates, but still want to be active, work on their game and connect with the NBA. The program features at-home basketball skills and drills that promote physical activity and character development and can be completed individually and in limited space. It also includes curated content and messages from NBA and WNBA players to inspire boys and girls around the world to stay active in a healthy and safe way. The program will feature daily posts on the @jrnba social media channels (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) and NBA digital properties across the globe, and integration with NBA technology partner and mobile basketball training application HomeCourt .

He was 94. Stankovic was at the helm of FIBA from 1976 to 2002 and was a member of the International Olympic Committee. During his leadership, he was credited with working toward building bridges between East and West during the Cold War and working closely with the then-NBA Commissioner, David Stern, in the late 1980s and early \u201990s to bring world basketball into the modern era. That resulted in American professional players participating in the top-level national team competitions, starting at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. For his contributions to the game, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1991. FIBA Secretary General Andreas Zagklis said in a statement \u201cas the leader of the International Basketball Federation for a quarter of a century, Borislav Stankovic will always be one of the most important figures in the history of our sport.\u201d As a player, he helped Red Star Belgrade win two national titles, in 1946 and 1947, and had 36 caps for the Yugoslav national team, including at the inaugural FIBA Basketball World Cup in 1950 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a coach, he captured four Yugoslav league titles and one in the Italian league. Stankovic died in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. The cause of his death was not given. He is survived by one daughter and two granddaughters."},{"id":28142,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-shuttering-facilities-more-teams-face-positive-tests","date":"2020-03-20","title":"NBA shuttering facilities as more teams face positive tests","content":"The number of known coronavirus cases within the NBA doubled to 14 on Thursday, when Marcus Smart of the Boston Celtics pleaded with people to take social distancing more seriously and the league ordered all teams to shutter their training facilities indefinitely. Smart revealed that he tested positive and the Los Angeles Lakers said two of their players tested positive as well , bringing the number of players who have acquired the virus to 10. The Philadelphia 76ers said three members of their organization tested positive and the Denver Nuggets said someone within their franchise was positive as well . The 76ers and Nuggets did not say if the affected people were players, coaches or other staff. \u201cI\u2019ve had no symptoms and I feel great,\u201d Smart said on Twitter . \u201cBut the younger generation in our country MUST self distance. This is not a joke. Not doing so is selfish. Together we can beat this, but we must beat it together by being apart for a short while.\u201d The league wants its teams to keep distance as well. Earlier Thursday, the NBA sent a memo to teams telling them to close their training and practice facilities to all players and staff \u2014 plus recommending that players \u201ctake aggressive measures to avoid contact with others and remain home as much as possible, leaving only for essential activities.\u201d Smart said he waited five days for his test results. \u201cI\u2019ve been self-quarantined since the test, thank goodness,\u201d Smart tweeted. \u201cCOVID-19 must be taken with the highest level of seriousness. I know it\u2019s a #1 priority for our nations health experts, & we must get more testing ASAP.\u201d Smart\u2019s comments and the other positive-test revelations came hours after the NBA\u2019s memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press , was sent Thursday afternoon. The league told teams that it was going to more-stringent policies \u201cin light of the rapidly-developing coronavirus situation, and consistent with evolving advice from health experts regarding how to promote individual and public health while minimizing the spread of the virus.\u201d As recently as Monday, the NBA was telling teams that individual workouts could take place at team facilities using what the league called the \u201cone player, one coach, one basket\u201d rule. Now, that\u2019s not even permitted. If players are going to work out during the league\u2019s shutdown, they\u2019ll have to do it at home or some other private facility. Public facilities, like gyms or college courts \u2014 many of which are closed anyway \u2014 aren\u2019t permitted to be used by NBA players under the league\u2019s coronavirus policy. Essential activities, by NBA definition, include buying food, medicine, or other necessary supplies; obtaining critical medical services; providing necessary care for a family member in another household; or attending to some other emergency. Brooklyn, Utah and Detroit join the Celtics and Lakers as teams known to have players who have tested positive. In all, seven NBA teams \u2014 when adding the 76ers and Nuggets \u2014 have revealed positive tests. Across the U.S., the death toll has reached at least 178 and known infections climbed past 11,000 Thursday. \u201cWe will navigate these uncharted waters together,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder wrote in an open letter to Utah fans on Thursday, thanking them for their support. \u201cRight now, we are all sacrificing in our own unique ways \u2014 for our health and for the greater good \u2014 and that is critical.\u201d With the belief that there are going to be no NBA games for several more weeks, at minimum, the league clearly felt Thursday was the right time to take the additional step of urging players to limit exposure. The NBA said its infectious disease specialists agree with other public health experts and that, \u201cto mitigate the spread of the coronavirus \u2026 until further notice, team practice or training facilities\u201d needed to be closed to players and staff. The league said the ban applies to G League facilities as well. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. The NBA had already banned teams, as part of the coronavirus response, from using public health clubs, fitness centers, gyms and college facilities. Teams can, however, set players up with training, conditioning, or other instructional materials for use at their homes. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly blessed to just have some free weights here. I have a versa climber. I have enough stuff that I won\u2019t take a step back,\u201d Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure that I\u2019m maintaining and hopefully keep my wind up and stay strong and just keep that constant tension on my body because it\u2019s tough right now. I haven\u2019t really left the house much.\u201d The league also reminded teams Thursday that it recommends players remain in their team markets and avoid all non-essential travel, though players \u2014 in concert with their team \u2014 can choose to go to another city and stay there instead. But players still cannot travel outside of North America; one of the reasons for that is logistical, since it is unclear if players who hypothetically want to return to homes in Europe would be allowed to fly back to the U.S. Thursday was the eighth full day of the NBA\u2019s shutdown because of the virus. That brings the total of games missed to 57, including the two called off on March 11 \u2014 the night that the positive test of Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert was revealed and the league announced that it was suspending the season. Smart and the Celtics played Utah on March 6.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was quick to make up for the wages employees lost at American Airlines Center would lose because of the suspended NBA season. He also recently committed to donate more than $100,000 to area nonprofits amid the COVID-19 outbreak. While the United States and the world work through the coronavirus pandemic, Cuban \u2014 like many around the world \u2014 is hopeful the NBA and other leagues can return to play before too long.

Silver, as he often does, said he hopes the NBA can be a conduit to spark positive change in the country \u2014 especially now when there will be a real need. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ll say about the United States \u2026 we\u2019re an incredible country and some of the greatest inventions, some of the best innovations, some of the best minds are in this country,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure as people are sitting home but still working they\u2019re thinking of these various things like how can we restart the economy and what role can the NBA play?\u201d Silver also said he doesn\u2019t know when play can return. The NBA has said the shutdown will be at least 30 days, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has subsequently said it recommends no gatherings of more than 50 people take place before mid-May. \u201cI don\u2019t have a good enough sense of how long a period this is going to be,\u201d Silver said. In other matters Silver discussed: TEAM TESTING Silver said eight full NBA teams have been tested for the coronavirus, which is more than was previously known, as well as members of other teams who were showing symptoms. The Brooklyn Nets , Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz and Toronto Raptors have said publicly that they have been tested; the Los Angeles Lakers indicated Tuesday that they would be tested. The Detroit Pistons said a player was tested; that player, according to a person with knowledge of the situation and spoke to The Associated Press , was Christian Wood, who tested positive. Silver did not identify the other teams that got tested. He did, however, stand by the decisions teams were making to get tested even amid criticism. \u201cPeople were not taking these protocols all that seriously until the NBA did what it did,\u201d Silver said. Silver said he has not been tested. NO PREDICTIONS Silver would not offer a percentage guess as to his level of certainty that play will resume this season. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic by nature and I want to believe that we\u2019ll be able to salvage at least some portion of this season,\u201d Silver said. Silver said the league will \u201ctry by every means that we can\u201d to play basketball again soon, though insisted that public health officials will sign off on any resumption plan first. Asked by ESPN host Rachel Nichols if the league would crown scoring leader James Harden of the Houston Rockets the scoring champion if the season wouldn\u2019t resume or if the league would go ahead with voting for the traditional end-of-season awards, Silver said \u201cI\u2019m not there yet. We\u2019ll figure it out. I hope I\u2019m not just in denial, but I\u2019m just not there yet.\u201d"},{"id":28185,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-clippers-terance-mann-ligament-surgery-hand","date":"2020-03-18","title":"Clippers\u2019 Terance Mann has ligament surgery on right hand","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Los Angeles Clippers guard Terance Mann has had surgery to repair a ligament in his right hand, the team said Wednesday.

On March 13, he offered up $100,000 to help the workers in Cleveland address what he described as their \u201csudden life shift.\u201d The Cavs star also appeared in a video from the NBA in which he stressed the importance of compassion and empathy as people around the United States and the world deal with the affects of COVID-19. Love was on Wednesday\u2019s edition of the \u201cToday Show\u201d and said his desire to help and speak out so much during the coronavirus pandemic was borne from a desire to help how he could as an NBA player. \u201cYou have people living paycheck to paycheck so I felt this is really the time, especially for us NBA players to walk the walk and be more than just athletes,\u201d Love said. \u201cWe see people in the community, we see people working in our arena at least 41 nights a year, us playing home games. So it was just a way for me to try and help navigate this stressful and incredibly anxiety-ridden time. \u201cTo just pay it forward and really help them. It\u2019s been tough, just trying to normalize the conversation around what is going on. People are feeling a certain way about it so I think it\u2019s more of a time for us to step up and be leaders, to be community leaders and do what is right for the people that are having a very stressful and tough time.\u201d Love isn\u2019t the only player to donate money to part-time workers in NBA cities, as other players and teams have made similar commitments. Reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks is making a $100,000 pledge on behalf of his family and fellow Bucks star Khris Middleton is also donating $100,000. Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans said he would \u201ccover the salaries\u201d for workers at the team\u2019s arena for the next 30 days. Blake Griffin of the Detroit Pistons pledged $100,000 for workers there. Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, the first NBA player diagnosed with coronavirus, pledged $200,000 to part-time employees as part of a $500,000 overall donation to help in relief services. Dr. Michelle Craske, a psychologist and professor at UCLA \u2014 which is Love\u2019s alma mater \u2014 joined Love on the interview Thursday and spoke about the importance of dealing with anxiety from the coronavirus pandemic in meaningful and helpful ways. Love has had a well-documented, long-term battle with anxiety and depression and has worked closely with Craske over the years in helping to bring the issue to light both in the NBA and in Cleveland . Love said in Wednesday\u2019s interview that Craske has helped him keep aspects of the coronavirus pandemic in perspective. \u201cShe had a great saying yesterday that I hadn\u2019t heard and its social distancing doesn\u2019t mean social or self-isolation. I think during those times you can feel incredibly hopeless and I think that is at the root of all anxiety and depression first and foremost,\u201d Love said. \u201cObviously we have been distanced right now from pretty much everyone else to groups smaller than 10 people, so it\u2019s really, really important to be empathetic to that. Continue to tell people what you are going through, I know it\u2019s a very stressful anxiety ridden time, like I said last night \u2026 nothing unites us like the common enemy. I think if we can attack this together human beings can be extremely, extremely resilient and we will all get through it.

Those were the three assistants under Popovich last summer as well at the Basketball World Cup in China. \u201cEverything\u2019s just up in the air,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of whether things are going to be delayed or anything.

The original plan was to pick a 12-player roster by early June, and for that team to gather in Las Vegas in early July to begin training camp. Officially, no part of that plan has changed yet.

The Nets did not name the players Tuesday, but Durant confirmed he was one of them to The Athletic , saying: \u201cEveryone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d The Nets announced that one player is exhibiting symptoms, while the other three are asymptomatic. All four players have been isolated and are under the care of team physicians. \u201cThe health of our players and staff is of the highest priority to the organization and the team is doing everything within its power to ensure that those affected receive the best care possible,\u201d the Nets said in a statement. Brooklyn\u2019s most recent game was March 10 in Los Angeles against the Lakers. After the Nets announced their test results, the Lakers \u2014 who have the NBA\u2019s second-best record this season and two of the game\u2019s biggest stars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis \u2014 indicated that their team will now be tested. \u201cGiven the exposure risks from our game against the Nets on March 10th, we are following the next steps of our COVID-19 procedures and protocol that are established in consultation with various health officials, the NBA and our UCLA Health doctors,\u201d the Lakers said. \u201cThe health and well-being of our players, staff, fans, and society in general, is of paramount importance to us, and will continue to be our focus.\u201d For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. The Nets said that all players and members of their travel party are being asked to remain isolated and closely monitor their health, but the team\u2019s ability to get testing that has been unavailable to so many others drew criticism from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe wish them a speedy recovery. But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested,\u201d de Blasio wrote on Twitter . \u201cTests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass later said that public health officials and team physicians had concerns that players \u2014 because of their direct contact with each other and interactions with the general public \u2014 \u201ccould accelerate the spread of the virus.\u201d The NBA\u2019s hope is that the platform its players have will raise awareness among the game\u2019s fan basis on the topic of taking precautions seriously. Several NBA players have taped messages in recent days on the topic; Portland\u2019s Pau Gasol, for example, released one Tuesday thanking first responders for their work on the front lines of the crisis. \u201cHopefully, by these players choosing to make their test results public, they have drawn attention to the critical need for young people to follow CDC recommendations in order to protect others, particularly those with underlying health conditions and the elderly,\u201d Bass said. It is unknown how many teams have been tested. Brooklyn beat the Lakers in that March 10 matchup. The Nets were then to face the Golden State Warriors two nights later in San Francisco \u2014 a game that was to be played without fans because of a decision made by local officials there \u2014 before the NBA season was suspended after Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Durant was in Los Angeles for the Nets\u2019 game against the Lakers, but was not in San Francisco for the game against the Warriors, his former club. \u201cI saw that news,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of the Nets\u2019 positive tests while speaking on a conference call. \u201cI\u2019m hoping none of our players went and hung out with guys the night before our game. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case or not.\u201d Kerr added that he didn\u2019t need to be convinced that suspending the season was the correct decision. \u201cI think everything that\u2019s happened since the league shut down was enough proof that we did the right thing, that the NBA did the right thing and that we need to follow the advice of the experts out there and everybody\u2019s got to do their part,\u201d Kerr said. Meanwhile, the NBA\u2019s board of governors met again Tuesday for what a person familiar with the details of the call categorized as an \u201cupdate\u201d on the pandemic and the league\u2019s response. Among the speakers addressing team owners was former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term and discussed the U.S. response to the virus, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the call\u2019s details were not released publicly. Besides the four Nets and Gobert, Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell and Detroit\u2019s Christian Wood are the other NBA players who have tested positive. The Nets said they are currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting. \u201cIf everybody in the world would just stay home for 2 weeks regardless if they have symptoms or not, this thing would blow over a lot faster,\u201d Washington\u2019s Davis Bertans tweeted. \u2014 AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami and AP Sports Writer Janie McCauley in San Francisco contributed to this report."},{"id":28152,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brooklyn-nets-four-players-test-positive-official-release","date":"2020-03-17","title":"Statement from the Brooklyn Nets","content":"BROOKLYN \u2013 Four Brooklyn Nets players have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.

Mitchell did his first public interview since he tested positive for coronavirus on March 12, speaking to ABC\u2019s Robyn Roberts during the March 16 edition of \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d In that interview, Mitchell repeatedly said he showed no symptoms or signs of the virus and has been in quarantine ever since being diagnosed. \u201cThe biggest thing for me is just to stay in isolation and just keep to myself,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI have no symptoms, which is a unique situation.\u201d \u201cI keep making the joke to people that ask that if you were to tell me I might play in a seven-game series tomorrow, I\u2019d be ready to lace up. I\u2019m really blessed that that\u2019s the case.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s case came after his teammate, All-Star center Rudy Gobert, became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the NBA on March 11. Aside from Mitchell, Pistons big man Christian Wood \u2014 who matched up against Gobert in Utah\u2019s March 7 road win \u2014 also reportedly has coronavirus as well in news that broke over the weekend. Over the weekend, both Gobert and Mitchell posted videos via the NBA to update fans on their condition. In his video , Gobert says he is \u201cfeeling a little better every single day\u201d and encouraged fans to use smart hygiene practices to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus. In Mitchell\u2019s video , he said he is feeling \u201cfine\u201d and \u201ctaking the proper precautions\u201d in being in isolation. \u201cI\u2019m asymptomatic. I don\u2019t have any symptoms,\u201d Mitchell said Monday on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI could walk down the street. If it wasn\u2019t public knowledge that I was sick, you wouldn\u2019t know it. I think that\u2019s the scariest part the virus: you may seem fine, be fine and but you never know who you may be talking to and who they\u2019re going home to.\u201d Before leaving a media session at shootaround in Salt Lake City on Monday in advance of a game against Detroit that night, Gobert touched all the tape recorders that were placed before him on a table, devices that reporters who cover the Jazz were using. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s not much we can do right now,\u201d Gobert said in that session when asked about how teams are dealing with the virus. And a minute or so later, before he ran out a side door, he touched all the recorders. It is not known if Gobert is responsible for Mitchell contracting the virus, or vice versa. On Friday, Gobert posted on social media to apologize for his actions , writing: \u201cI have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment. The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.\u201d Mitchell told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d he had seen Gobert\u2019s postings and videos online. However, he said he needed some time to get over his anger in the wake of being diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cTo be honest with you, it took a while for me to cool off. I read what he said and I heard what he said. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s doing OK, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m doing well,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m just really happy, to be honest, Robyn, that it\u2019s just \u2014 I hate to say this \u2014 just two of us and it wasn\u2019t the whole party at the end of the day. Neither him or I have children at home \u2014 I have some teammates that have children, some staff that have children at home. So, I\u2019m glad we were able to kind of contain it as much as possible.\u201d Mitchell says he has spent his time in quarantine playing NBA 2K20, watching movies and watching some old highlights of himself from his college to his NBA days. However, none of those things replicate the joy of playing in the games. \u201cI think as of the basketball world saw yesterday, some of the guys are watching their old highlights,\u201d Mitchell said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of that. I\u2019ve watched myself through college, I\u2019ve watched myself through the NBA \u2026 it\u2019s kind of bringing back good memories, but you miss the game. You miss playing in front of some of the best fans in the world in the NBA.\u201d Mitchell made it known during the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview that he would be helping to pay for lunches in the Granite School District in Salt Lake City. The program, which the team announced Monday, will allow students in the district to obtain a meal at no charge while schools are participating in a closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cAs we all navigate the challenges that have arisen with COVID-19, there are many people impacted,\u201d MItchell said in a statement released by the team. \u201cMy mom\u2019s career in education made me value children and the importance of academics, and I want to make sure that kids can continue to eat a meal while they can\u2019t go to school. \u201cOur community is resilient and unified, and seeing how people have come together during this time makes me proud to represent this great state.\u201d Under this program, any child under the age of 19, including preschool children, can show up at a designated site and eat a meal at no charge. During regular school days, vulnerable students are served meals in programs largely funded by the federal government. This partnership between Mitchell and Granite School District helps address gaps in service while school is out of session and for students who may not typically qualify under the federal guidelines. The Granite School District is one of the largest in Utah, with 88 schools serving 67,730 students in Salt Lake City. Granite serves some of Utah\u2019s most vulnerable children, including a large population of refugee students. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

In an exclusive video interview with Bleacher Report, L.A. guard Danny Green informed B\/R\u2019s Taylor Rooks that the Lakers are still holding individual workouts while remaining abreast of any and all developments. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually allowed to be around each other as a group right now. Individual workouts were happening (Saturday). We did see some guys in passing, got a chance to talk a little bit, chop it up. Guys are figuring out what the next move is.\u201d The Lakers are expected to receive more updates and information on Monday. In the meantime, Green added that many of his teammates are looking into responsible avenues of \u201cgetting away\u201d with their families during the NBA\u2019s hiatus, which began Wednesday and will last at least 30 days . It\u2019s a drastic change in day-to-day living; Green admitted it will likely start wearing thin sooner than later. \u201cI think most guys are just habitually used to being in the gym every day with each other and playing,\u201d Green said. \u201cI think, you know, a week away from basketball for us is like a long period of time. Obviously it\u2019s still fresh. It\u2019s only a couple of days, but a week from now, guys will be very bored and not know what to do with their idle time.\u201d Green stressed the importance of players and the league taking things one step at a time, though he remains eager to see the sports world resume its normal cycle. \u201cHopefully we get better news than worse and things get back to normal sooner than later. Stopping pretty much all sports, professionally and collegiate, it\u2019s tough to swallow.

We will work closely and expeditiously with our partners, including service contractors, event promoters and unions to implement this plan.

As an usher, he interacts with fans in a role he calls a staple of his life. But there are no Nuggets games for at least a month. No Rapids games, either. And Edelman has no idea what he\u2019ll do now. \u201cThis is what I do for a living,\u201d Edelman said earlier this week, as the realization hit that sports were going on hiatus because of the coronavirus. \u201cThis is my income.\u201d Thousands of workers would have staffed the 450 NBA and NHL games that will not be played over the next month in response to the pandemic. And then there are the more than 300 spring training and regular-season baseball games, 130 NCAA Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournament games, 50 or so Major League Soccer matches, all international golf and tennis tournaments, and who-knows-how-many high school, small college and other entertainment events canceled or postponed because of the global health crisis. The total economic impact of the loss of sports and other events because of the pandemic \u2014 assuming only a month shutdown \u2014 is impossible to calculate but will reach the billions, easily. Tickets aren\u2019t being sold, so teams and leagues and organizing bodies lose money. Fans aren\u2019t going to events that aren\u2019t happening, so taxi drivers and ride-share operators have no one to ferry to and from those places. Hotel rooms will be empty. Beers and hot dogs aren\u2019t being sold, so concessionaires and vendors lose money. Wait staff and bartenders aren\u2019t getting tips. Without those tips, their babysitters aren\u2019t getting paid. The trickle-down effect sprawls in countless directions. \u201cAs players, we wanted to do something, along with our ownership and coaches, to help ease the pain during this time,\u201d star guard Stephen Curry said. Some teams and top players are trying to help. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, within minutes of the NBA shutdown announcement, said he wanted to find a way to help workers who will lose money because games won\u2019t be played. By Friday, he had his plan: \u201cWe will pay them as if the games happened,\u201d he told The Associated Press in an email. The Golden State Warriors\u2019 ownership, players and coaches have pledged to donate $1 million to provide assistance to employees who work games at Chase Center. Other teams, including the Cleveland Cavaliers, have made commitments to workers at not just NBA events but also the building\u2019s minor-league hockey games. The Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards and Atlanta Hawks were among the earliest NBA franchises to reveal they\u2019re working on how they\u2019ll take care of arena staffs. So have the NHL\u2019s Washington Capitals, among others, and the ownership group for Detroit\u2019s Pistons, Red Wings and Tigers on Friday said they were setting up a $1 million fund \u201cto cover one month\u2019s wages for our part-time staff for games, concerts and events that they would have otherwise worked.\u201d \u201cOur teams, our cities and the leagues in which we operate are a family, and we are committed to looking out for one another,\u201d New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris said. Cavaliers star Kevin Love pledged $100,000 to help the workers in Cleveland address what he described as their \u201csudden life shift.\u201d On Friday, reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks made a $100,000 pledge on behalf of his family \u2014 and the team said later Friday that fellow Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton also donated $100,000. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than basketball! And during this tough time I want to help the people that make my life, my family\u2019s lives and my teammates lives easier,\u201d Antetokounmpo wrote on Twitter. Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans said he would \u201ccover the salaries\u201d for workers at the team\u2019s arena for the next 30 days. Blake Griffin of the Detroit Pistons pledged $100,000 for workers there, the San Jose Sharks said part-time arena workers would get paid for all games not played and Florida Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky said he was giving $100,000 to workers in that club\u2019s arena \u2014 a donation matched by his teammates and followed by another pledge from the team\u2019s ownership group. \u201cThis is a small way for me to express my support and appreciation for these wonderful people who have been so great to me and my teammates and hopefully we can all join together to relieve some of the stress and hardship caused by this national health crisis,\u201d Williamson wrote on Instagram. The help \u2014 all of it \u2014 will go to good use. At Chicago Blackhawks hockey games alone, about 1,500 workers are in or outside the building on event nights: guest services, concessions, parking, security, box office and so on. \u201cThe per game payroll is more than $250,000,\u201d said Courtney Greve Hack, a spokeswoman for the United Center. If that\u2019s the NHL norm \u2014 no official numbers are available \u2014 then workers around the league would stand to lose more than $60 million if hockey does not return this season. \u201cI get it,\u201d said Chris Lee, who owns a coffee and smoothies franchise in Arizona that draws 70% of its annual revenue sales at spring training and Arizona Coyotes hockey games. \u201cBut this is going to be really tough.\u201d Lee was packing up cups that won\u2019t be used when baseball announced Thursday that spring training was ending about two weeks early. He and his staff \u2014 one full-timer, 14 part-time employees \u2014 aren\u2019t sure what comes next. The enormity of the numbers stacks up quickly. The group that owns the Raptors and other pro sports clubs in Toronto, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, says it\u2019s trying to help 4,000 workers in that city. Extrapolate that across other Canadian and U.S. pro sports cities, and those teams could be looking at 100,000 workers feeling some sort of pinch \u2014 not counting the impact at college and other levels. Some events won\u2019t happen, and it is unclear if workers affected by those cancellations will get any help. The NCAA men\u2019s Division I tournament generates about $900 million annually through television and marketing rights alone. In Albany, New York, which was scheduled to host men\u2019s tournament games for the first time in 17 years, organizers estimated the economic loss from the three-day event to be about $3 million. Bars and restaurants bought tons of additional stock and perishables to prep for crowds that won\u2019t arrive. It\u2019ll probably take a few years before the NCAA can bring the tournament back to many of the cities slated to host games next week. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disheartening. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d said Mark Bardack, president of public relations and management firm Ed Lewi and Associates, which had worked for more than a year on the planning of the tournament in Albany. \u201cTo have it all disappear, though obviously no one\u2019s fault.\u201d Some arena workers, many not wanting to be identified because of workplace policies about speaking to reporters, said they are living paycheck-to-paycheck. They\u2019re not alone, of course: A study last fall by the American Payroll Association said 74% of workers in the U.S. would \u201cexperience financial difficulty\u201d if their usual payday was delayed by as little as one week. In Philadelphia, Rodney Thompson works on commission selling popcorn and beer at 76ers basketball games, Flyers hockey games and Phillies baseball games. They\u2019re all on hold. \u201cThe more I sell, the more I make,\u201d the 56-year-old said. \u201cThe less I sell, the less I make. It would hurt me, financially. I would have no income coming in. \u2026 I make pretty good money. But if there\u2019s no fans, there\u2019s no work.\u201d AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno in Washington, AP Sports Writers Tom Withers in Cleveland, David Brandt in Scottsdale, Arizona, Josh Dubow in San Francisco, Stephen Hawkins in Dallas and Dan Gelston in Philadelphia, and Associated Press Writers Matthew Carlson and Tim Cronin in Chicago contributed to this report. * * * The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Silver\u2019s comments, in an interview on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d studio show, confirmed an ESPN report Wednesday afternoon that NBA owners had encouraged the commissioner to re-evaluate the hiatus in 30 days. So the league will be dark until approximately April 9 or April 10, less than a week from the scheduled end of the regular season. That\u2019s the point at which the Silver and the Board of Governors will try to determine when \u2014 or if \u2014 the 2019-20 season resumes. \u201cEven if we\u2019re out for six weeks, we could still restart the season,\u201d Silver told the show\u2019s panel of Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kenny Smith and host Ernie Johnson. \u201cThe Finals might take place in July, [even] late July. \u201cThe notion of at least 30 days is just to try to give people some guidance,\u201d the commissioner added. \u201cThis literally changes hour by hour, as far as what we know.\u201d Johnson asked Silver if it\u2019s possible the NBA might have to cancel the remainder of its season and the playoffs. \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible,\u201d Silver said . \u201cI just don\u2019t know more at this point.\u201d Fact-finding was difficult enough Wednesday, when a teleconference meeting of the Board of Governors served to assess the virus\u2019 impact and the league\u2019s options for coping with it. One planned scenario \u2014 staging games without spectators allowed into the arenas to thwart further infection \u2014 quickly gave way Silver\u2019s decision to postpone play, after Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert was discovered to have tested positive for the virus. The Jazz\u2019s game at Oklahoma City was delayed, then cancelled. A later game Wednesday between New Orleans and Sacramento also was scratched because referee Courtney Kirkland had worked Utah\u2019s game Monday against Toronto. Another Jazz player, Donovan Mitchell, had tested positive for the coronavirus by Thursday morning. Charles Barkley, the Hall of Famer who is a fixture on the TNT show, participated by phone. He was sitting out a 48-hour quarantine advised by his doctors after seeking treatment for flu-like symptoms. Barkley shared with viewers that he was awaiting test results for the virus that leads to COVID-19, the pandemic that has seized the world\u2019s attention, rocked the U.S. economy and sparked cancellations across the sports, entertainment and business landscape. \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling great,\u201d Barkley said . \u201cI\u2019m just kind of in limbo right now. I\u2019m really hoping it was just a bug.\u201d A shutdown of 30 days would be enough to alter the quality of play, Smith said, or at least the competition as established over the first 65 games or so in the 82-game season. \u201cWhat if this goes to two months? What if it goes to three months?\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt changes the complexion of how you think of things. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to continue in the exact groove they were. \u201cThat would be my number. Thirty days. That ain\u2019t the same team coming back. That\u2019s not the same rhythm they were in.\u201d Silver said that some of the discussion with the owners focused on the resumption of play, including how players could stay in shape and whether they would be most safe from infection by staying in their teams\u2019 markets during the hiatus. \u201cAll of those things are still on the table,\u201d the commissioner said, \u201cbecause this has happened so quickly.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A second Jazz player, Donovan Mitchell, said Thursday that he has also tested positive. Later, in an open letter to NBA fans, Silver said we intend to resume the season, if and when it becomes safe for all concerned.\u201d Silver did not say if the league intends for the regular season to resume or if the NBA, should it return to action, would immediately go into postseason play. It\u2019s also unclear if play will be able to resume with fans in the stands, something the league\u2019s owners were willing to go without prior to Gobert\u2019s diagnosis and the escalation of the situation. The 30-day minimum hiatus would mean no games until at least April 10. Silver said the league and the players association will have to continue determining \u201cwhat makes sense here without compromising anyone\u2019s safety and I think it\u2019s frankly too early to tell,\u201d Silver said. The regular season was to go until April 15, with the playoffs scheduled to start on April 18 and the NBA Finals to begin June 4. The NBA\u2019s 30-day plan was decided on the same day that in response to the virus, that would be delayed at least two weeks and the in its season. \u201cThis literally changes hour-by-hour in terms of what we know,\u201d Silver said.

Barkley said he has been tested for COVID-19 and has not yet received the results. \u201cThis thing is so scary,\u201d Barkley said. For now, NBA players have been told to remain in their home market through at least Monday \u2014 some teams such as the Toronto Raptors that are self-quarantining would, in theory, need to remain place for longer \u2014 and speak to a team physician or team athletic trainer once daily. Group workouts and practices are not being permitted yet. In most cases the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus; in mild cases it can take about two weeks, in more severe cases it can take 3-6 weeks. \u201cThis remains part of a complicated and rapidly evolving situation that reminds us that we are all part of a broader society with a responsibility to look out for one another,\u201d Silver wrote. \u201cThat is what the NBA will continue to do, and we are grateful for your understanding and for being the best fans in sports.\u201d There are 259 games left unplayed on this season\u2019s schedule. If the regular season is not resumed, that would be the second-largest number of games missed in league history. The 2011-12 season was shortened by a total of 240 games because of a lockout that wound up trimming 16 games from each team\u2019s schedule. The 1998-99 season lost 464 games because of another lockout where teams wound up playing a 50-game schedule. Shutting down could cost the league hundreds of millions in revenue such as tickets sold, concessions and purchases of souvenirs and merchandise \u2014 adding to the financial concerns of a year where the league lost as much as $400 million, by its own estimate, after a rift last fall that started with a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. It also could cost players as well. What is called a \u201cForce Majeure Event\u201d \u2014 the legal term for unforeseeable circumstances, such as an epidemic or pandemic \u2014 could come into play. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement , players could lose 1.08% of their annual salary for each game missed. That means Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, the league\u2019s highest-paid player this season, could lose about $435,000 for each game that ultimately is not played. A player who had a two-way contract converted to a regular NBA deal for this season would stand to lose about $9,700 per game. Also Thursday, the NBA 2K League announced that its scheduled March 24 start would be delayed and that its teams would \u201ccompete in preseason tournaments remotely\u201d to prepare for the season."},{"id":28236,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/coronavirus-pandemic-causes-nba-suspend-season","date":"2020-03-12","title":"Coronavirus pandemic causes NBA to suspend season after player tests positive","content":" Faced with concerns and uncertainties over COVID-19 (coronavirus) and the impact on its games, its business and its extended family of players, coaches and fans, the NBA suspended the 2019-20 season Wednesday until further notice. The slate of games Wednesday night \u2013 including the Jazz-Thunder game delayed before tipoff and postponed soon thereafter \u2013 was the last for an indefinite period of time. The New Orleans game at Sacramento, scheduled later than the others, subsequently was cancelled as well. \u201cThe NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the league announced. The trigger for the league-wide suspension of play was the unplayed game in OKC\u2019s Chesapeake Energy Arena. \u201cA player on the Utah Jazz preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19. The test result was reported shortly prior to the tipoff,\u201d according to the news release. Jazz stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell confirmed on Thursday that they both had tested positive for the coronavirus. \u201cAt that time, tonight\u2019s game was canceled. The affected player was not in the arena.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, the NBA Board of Governors had met via teleconference to discuss the virus, the safety of those involved and proposed scenarios for dealing with the health threat, from staging regular season games without spectators in the arenas to shutting down temporarily. The league announced in the afternoon that Golden State\u2019s home game against Brooklyn Thursday night, in fact, would be played without permitting ticket holders into the Chase Center in San Francisco. But the events that scuttled the Jazz-Thunder game, and the ripple effects, prompted the league to invoke the hiatus. Multiple reports cited Gobert as the infected player, although the league did not mention him by name. Denver coach Michael Malone also mentioned Gobert in his postgame news conference in Dallas. The Jazz issued a statement that read in part: \u201cThis morning a player on the Utah Jazz tested negative for influenza, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection. The individual\u2019s symptoms diminished over the course of today. However, in a precautionary measure and in consultation and cooperation with NBA medical staff and Oklahoma health officials, the decision was made to test for COVID-19. \u201cA preliminary positive result came back right before tip-off.\u201d The Jazz said the team is working with the Center for Disease Control [CDC], the league and officials in Oklahoma and Utah. The Utah player was receiving care in Oklahoma City. Rapidly escalating questions and fears about COVID-19 \u2013 and how the NBA could best protect its participants and fans \u2013 led on Monday to a joint decision with other major sports leagues to close locker rooms to the media. Interviews with players and coaches were conducted in press conference-like set-ups elsewhere in the arenas, and reporters were required to stay 6-8 feet away from those interviewed. Gobert had poked fun at the policy Monday, after the Jazz\u2019s morning shootaround, touching all the microphones and recorders placed on the table in front of him. Teams also had advised employees, as with most of the general public, to wash hands frequently, to avoid handshakes and fistbumps and to refrain from touching one\u2019s face. But the decision to suspend the season has taken this to an entirely new and unprecedented level. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about basketball or money,\u201d said Dallas owner Mark Cuban in an ESPN interview, courtside while his Mavericks played host to the Nuggets. \u201cThis thing is just exploding to the point where all of a sudden, players and owners alike, you think about your family. You want to really make sure you\u2019re doing this the right way. Because now it\u2019s much more personal. \u201cYou see what\u2019s happened in other countries, with just the whole idea that it\u2019s come this close and potentially a couple players have it. \u2018Stunning\u2019 isn\u2019t the right word. I mean, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d In the Board of Governors discussion, various scenarios and implications reportedly were addressed. Including the financial hit of lost attendance, the effect on players\u2019 salaries if competing in empty buildings vs. not playing all and the impact on hundreds of other business relationships NBA teams have with vendors and workers in staging their games. Health concerns and some unsettled details shoved that all to the side Wednesday night. The Jazz players were essentially quarantined at Chesapeake Energy Arena after they left the court moments before the cancellation was announced. Teams that had faced Utah recently reportedly were encouraged to self-quarantine. The NBA had lost regular-season games in the past to labor lockouts. The 1998-99 season did not start until February 1999 with a 50-game schedule and the 2011-12 season consisted of 66 games that began on Christmas, both delayed by protracted collective bargaining negotiations. Suspending a season in progress \u2014 with five weeks remaining in the 82-game schedule and playoffs set to begin April 18 \u2014 is entirely new. With no resumption date in sight for now. Cuban said this was not going to be like a lockout, which players waiting out the delay however and wherever they chose. \u201cTalking to some of the guys not playing on the bench,\u201d Cuban said, \u201cit was like, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t think you guys are going to be able to leave town. \u2026 The whole idea is, the only way we can have any control over it and makes sure players are healthy is that we know where they\u2019re at and who they\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Initial reports were that teams would be permitted to practice and maintain their game readiness. But the reach of the virus and procedures for dealing with it have been moving targets, with new information altering decisions made hours or days earlier. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, in the midst of its conference tournaments and on the brink of its wildly popular \u201cMarch Madness\u201d national championship tournaments, decided Wednesday to play games without audiences. Many colleges and universities from which those teams are drawn were sending students out of dorms and off campus to continue studies online. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Later, his Jazz teammate Rudy Gobert \u2014 the first NBA player to test positive, which prompted the league to suspend the season \u2014 also confirmed his status and apologized. \u201cI was careless and make no excuse,\u201d Gobert said in an Instagram post. Mitchell\u2019s positive test was not known until early Thursday, the first full day of the NBA\u2019s hiatus. Jazz players, staff and some beat writers covering the team were tested Wednesday night in Oklahoma City, where Utah was to play the Thunder in a game that was called off moments before tip-off once word about Gobert\u2019s positive test was received. Also Thursday, the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors \u2014 teams that have all recently played against Gobert, Mitchell and the Jazz \u2014 all said that they were having some players and staff self-quarantine for as many as 14 days. The Cleveland Cavaliers, another team that has recently faced Utah, said they are not mandating quarantines yet but would if any of their players exhibit troubling symptoms. \u201cThanks to everyone who has been reaching out since hearing the news about my positive test,\u201d Mitchell wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cWe are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them.\u201d Gobert was not among those behaving responsibly. It started as a joke: Before leaving a media session at shootaround in Salt Lake City on Monday in advance of a game against Detroit that night, Gobert touched all the tape recorders that were placed before him on a table, devices that reporters who cover the Jazz were using. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s not much we can do right now,\u201d Gobert said in that session when asked about how teams are dealing with the virus. And a minute or so later, before he ran out a side door, he touched all the recorders. It isn\u2019t so funny now \u2014 not with two Jazz players now having tested positive for the virus, and with a league on edge. It is not known if Gobert is responsible for Mitchell contracting the virus, or vice versa. \u201cI have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment,\u201d Gobert wrote. \u201cThe first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.\u201d For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Gobert became the center of why the league has been shut down for the foreseeable future after he became the first positive test. Among the immediate fallout. Utah\u2019s game against Oklahoma City Wednesday night was canceled and the season was suspended. Washington, which played Utah in late February, said Thursday that it was having its players, coaches and basketball operations personnel self-quarantine for the next three to four days. The Wizards played at Utah on Feb. 29. Washington also played Tuesday against the New York Knicks, another recent opponent of the Jazz. The Wizards said players, coaches and basketball operations staff who have flu-like symptoms will be tested for coronavirus. The Raptors also said Thursday they are self-quarantining. \u201cOur players, coaches and traveling staff have all been advised to into self-isolation for 14 days,\u201d the team said, also confirming that Toronto players had been tested. The Celtics said in a statement they have been constant communication with our Massachusetts Department of Public Health officials. The Celtics played the Jazz on Friday. The Celtics believe it is unlikely that anyone from the team came into contact with Gobert or Mitchell while they were contagious. But out of an abundance of caution the Celtics are having players and staff who were in close contact with Jazz players or who traveled to Milwaukee on Wednesday to self-quarantine through the weekend. Players and staff will then be tested for the virus. Gobert and Mitchell shared the court with 50 opposing players in those games, plus 15 referees. One of the refs was Courtney Kirkland, who was to work th e New Orleans-Sacramento game on Wednesday that got canceled because he had been on the court with for a Jazz game two nights earlier. Still unknown: How many ballboys, stat-crew employees, security guards, attendants and others were exposed by being around the Jazz or Gobert in recent days. Some Jazz reporters said they were getting tested for COVID-19; at least \u201cI\u2019m sure I probably had contact with him,\u201d Detroit\u2019s Langston Galloway said. The NBA shutdown could cost teams well into the hundreds of millions of dollars depending on how long the shutdown lasts. Those teams that have faced Gobert in recent days will likely face some testing. And at least two Jazz beat writers who were tested revealed Thursday that the results came back negative. State health labs and many commercial labs can conduct tests on mouth swabs, and health officials estimate that the system could handle about 20,000 tests per day. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d Detroit Pistons coach Dwane Casey said . \u201cI think it\u2019s the prudent thing to do. And what went on in Utah, I don\u2019t know all the information but that just shows you how fragile everything is right now.\u201d This is the reality of the coronavirus, which was labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Wednesday weeks after beginning its havoc-wreaking global run that has sickened well over 100,000 and killed more than 4,000. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. \u201cI will do whatever I can to support using my experience as way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus,\u201d Gobert wrote. \u201cI am under great care and will fully recover. Thank you again for all your support. I encourage everyone to take all of the steps to stay safe and healthy.\u201d The Jazz said Thursday that the team practice facility and Vivint Smart Home Arena \u2014where the team plays games and other concerts and events take place \u2014 are being cleaned and sanitized. It remains very unclear when the Jazz will use either of those facilities again. Charlotte coach James Borrego said these are scary times in the NBA, and no one argued. \u201cThey\u2019re all concerned and rightfully so,\u201d Casey said. \u201cEverybody in our league should be concerned. I think everybody in our country right now, more than just basketball, is concerned. We all have to take care of ourselves and look out for our fellow man.\u201d That\u2019s what Orlando\u2019s Evan Fournier did Wednesday night. Fournier, a French national teammate of Gobert\u2019s, reached out to him after news of the diagnosis and leaguewide shutdown broke. \u201cWas just on the phone with Rudy,\u201d Fournier wrote. \u201cHe is doing good man. Lets not (panic) everyone.

For now, all we know is the 2019-20 NBA season is suspended until further notice due to two Utah Jazz players testing positive for COVID-19. With so much uncertainty, it is unknown how all of this will impact the Kia Rookie of the Year chase. What is known is that, as of right now, Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant seems to be a virtual lock for the hardware. Sure, Zion Williamson was putting up insane numbers in his return (23.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg in 19 games), but it may end up being too little, too late. Morant has the Grizzlies in the playoffs and has been far and away the best rookie through 65 games of the season. He\u2019s been composed. He\u2019s been clutch. He\u2019s been dazzling, and he\u2019s simply been a game-changing revelation as he\u2019s separated himself from the pack. There are a lot of unknowns and much to be determined, but one thing\u2019s for sure: Morant \u2013 as of right now \u2014 is your Kia Rookie of the Year. * * * Editor\u2019s note:  Since this is our last look at the Ladder for the foreseeable future, these rankings will take into the season more as a whole, rather than placing extra weight on recent play. Last edition: No. 1  The Grizzlies will enter this hiatus as the current No. 8 seed in the West , and Morant is a major reason for that stunning spot in the standings. Many thought the Grizzlies were doomed for the Draft lottery, but Morant has changed that narrative. This week, Morant had one of his best shooting games, going 4-for-4 from beyond the arc in Memphis\u2019 118-101 win over the Hawks. He finished with 24 points, and helped get the Grizzlies back on track after a 25-point rout in Dallas. Nunn earns this No. 2 rung thanks to his overall body of work this season. In 62 games (all starts), Nunn has averaged 15.6 ppg on 44.8% shooting (36.2% on 3-pointers). The undrafted rookie has struggled lately, but put up 24 points on Wednesday, hitting a career-high six 3-pointers in a loss to Charlotte. The Heat will be in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoffs, and Nunn will be front and center. Williamson gets passed up on our list is simply due to his limited action. Eighteen games just isn\u2019t enough to put him past a 62-game starter like Nunn. Still, what Williamson has done in those 18 games is mind-boggling. He\u2019s been dominant in averaging 23.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg while shooting 58.9% overall. He\u2019s been a game-changer for the Pelicans, and helped turn them into a surprise playoff contender in the West. This week was no different as he helped New Orleans close out this part of the season with back-to-back wins over the Heat (17 points, 6 rebounds) and Timberwolves (23 points, 7 rebounds). White\u2019s hot streak continued this week as he averaged 22.3 ppg and 6.3 apg in three games. He also got his first career start, scoring 20 with five rebounds and five assists (and, um, nine turnovers) in a 108-103 win over the Cavs. \u201cIt was some little tweaks here and there with my first start. I had the ball in my hands a lot tonight,\u201d White said afterward . \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable as a point guard [to turn the ball over], but at the end of the day we got the win, so I\u2019ve just got to keep working on it.\u201d  White has now topped 20 points in eight of his last nine games, and, outside of Williamson (25.2 ppg), has been the best scoring rookie since the All-Star break (24.7 ppg). Last edition: No. 5 This is a tough decision, as Rui Hachimura has a solid case for this spot. Barrett, however, has shown signs of improvement over the last month to give him the edge on Hachimura (who also missed several weeks with a groin injury). Among rookies, Barrett is the fourth-best scorer (14.3 ppg), while grabbing 5.0 rpg (5th among rookies) and got his shooting percentage over 40% with a March in which he\u2019s shot 44.8% from the field (averaging 18.7 ppg this month). It has been a tough season for Barrett and the Knicks, but the potential is there, and his improvement should give fans hope. * * * Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards Season stats: 41 games, 13.4 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.7 apg, 47.8% FG, 27.4% 3FG Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Season stats: 47 games, 12.9 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.9 apg, 41.4% FG, 39.1% 3FG Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats: 50 games, 12.0 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.4 apg, 62.3% FG, 40.4% 3FG De\u2019Andre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks Season stats: 63 games, 12.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.8 apg, 41.0% FG, 35.5% 3FG Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors Season stats: 60 games, 14.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 2.1 apg, 49.7% FG, 28.7% 3FG * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, March 11 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

Now there will be no games at all, at least for the time being. Below is a collection of responses from NBA players and others on that news. * * *"},{"id":28228,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/vince-carter-thoughts-final-game-coronavirus","date":"2020-03-12","title":"Vince Carter at peace if he played in his final NBA game","content":" ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Vince Carter leaned back in his seat, dabbed his eyes and struggled to contain his emotions. He knew his playing days were coming to an end. Yet, after almost 22 seasons in the NBA, longer than anyone else has ever played the game at its highest level, this still seemed too quick, too sudden. He kept going back to one word Wednesday night. \u201cWeird.\u201d Carter, closing out his brilliant career with the struggling Atlanta Hawks, was a minor piece to the puzzle on an evening of fast-moving developments that brought the fear and misery of the coronavirus to the doorstep of the game he plays. It started with the NCAA making the shocking decision to play its signature men\u2019s basketball tournament \u2014 March Madness and the Final Four \u2014 in empty arenas around the land. There are certainly doubts that it will actually be played all. Then, after word came down that Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert had fallen ill, the NBA called a halt to its season at the conclusion of Wednesday night\u2019s games, with no timetable for when the schedule might resume with just a month to go before the playoffs. In the midst of all these momentous decisions and terrifying uncertainty, one of the NBA\u2019s greatest players, the guy who brought us the high-flying thrills of \u201cVinsanity\u201d and still had an ample amount of game at age 43, was playing possibly his final game. \u201cThere\u2019s so many unintended things that come about from this,\u201d Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. \u201cVince is probably the main one for us. Just understanding that this is kind of a surreal moment. This could be it for Vince. I\u2019m glad the fans were able to remind me of that.\u201d Indeed, in this world of smart phones and instantaneous news, the NBA\u2019s decision to suspend the season swept through the stands at State Farm Arena and all the way down the court while the Hawks were in the midst of a furious fourth-quarter rally, coming from 23 points down to force overtime against the New York Knicks. Atlanta star Trae Young heard about it from his father, watching the game at courtside. Teammate John Collins heard about it from a couple of guys on the bench as he was stepping to the free-throw line. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Collins said. It was true, of course. As the final seconds of what could be the final game ticked down, and the Knicks had secured a wild 136-131 victory, the fans began to chant. \u201cWe want Vince! We want Vince! We want Vince!\u201d Pierce heard them. Caught up in trying to win the game, the coach suddenly recognized that Carter\u2019s career \u2014 which was supposed to last 15 more games \u2014 might be actually be ending right here. After Julius Randle knocked down the first of two free throws, Pierce signaled for Carter to take the court. He checked in while the crowd roared. Randle made one more free throw, then the Knicks left the stage to the NBA\u2019s senior citizen. Carter dribbled to the top of arc, 26 feet from the basket. The New York players all peeled away, making sure he had a clear look at the 3-pointer. Nothing but net. When the horn finally sounded, Carter lingered on the court, doling out careful, hands-free hugs to those who had shown him so much respect. \u201cThank you Vince! \u201d the fans roared, over and over.  \u201cIf it ended today,\u201d Carter said, \u201cat least I scored my last basket. It will be a weird but cool memory.\u201d Maybe it was an appropriate way to go out. After all, when Carter began his pro career with the Toronto Raptors in 1998, the NBA was in the midst of a bitter labor dispute that wiped out most of the first half of his rookie season. When Carter finally took the court, he began a dazzling career that featured 10 straight trips to the All-Star Game in his prime and evolved into a role as the league\u2019s sage senior citizen, essentially a player-coach who advised and molded the next generation of stars. That\u2019s what brought him to Atlanta for the final two seasons of his career. He agreed to join a rebuilding team that had no hope of bringing him his first NBA title \u2014 the only real blemish on his resume \u2014 but did have talented young stars-in-the-making like Young and Collins. \u201cHim being here has helped me tremendously, especially with him knowing how to handle the spotlight and the bright lights,\u201d Young said. \u201cI obviously want to play a lot of years in this league. I\u2019m just trying to mimic a lot of the things he does day to day. He\u2019s a great person first.

And so the arena doors will not open, the ball won\u2019t bounce, the smells won\u2019t waft their way around the concourse and the sneakers won\u2019t squeak on court. Never before in its history has the NBA shut down over a public health crisis. Welcome to a world shaped by the coronavirus pandemic. This is the new abnormal, at least for now. The league indefinitely suspended the 2019-20 season at the conclusion of a six-game Wednesday, the reflex reaction after Jazz center Rudy Gobert reportedly tested positive for the virus just moments before Utah tipped against the Thunder in Oklahoma City. But even before that, commissioner Adam Silver and team owners spent a portion of the day putting the wheels in motion by hashing out emergency plans and contingencies. Shutting down the game was a last resort. A more agreeable move was to restrict games to players, media and selected support staff \u2014 play on without fans. The Warriors jumped that gun when, at the request of San Francisco government and health officials, they announced Thursday\u2019s home game with Brooklyn would be held in front of empty seats . Silver and the owners agreed to sleep on it and revisit talks Thursday morning, then a few hours later came the bombshell positive. That was followed by the realization referee Courtney Kirkland \u2014 slated to work the Pelicans-Kings game \u2014 had worked a Jazz game earlier in the week. Wednesday\u2019s game was immediately canceled . Gradually, then suddenly. There may be irritation felt by some fans who feel this is over-reacting and are deprived of their nightly entertainment, and certainly a financial pinch felt by workers whose rents depend on games being played. But we\u2019re in the throes of a global pandemic, and in the big picture, these kid\u2019s games and temporary escapes are not terribly important. The NBA\u2019s priority is to fall in line with other companies and organizations and help contain the contagious virus. In fact, the league\u2019s responsibility is far greater because the games are held before the masses in confined areas. These are events where thousands are in close contact with each other \u2014 fans who shake hands, touch guardrails and seats, sneeze and cough, hand money to cashiers and often exchange DNA with players who give autographs. Players touch the same basketball, give bro hugs and fist pumps; the chance of the infection spreading in those situations among the players themselves is heightened, even if they\u2019re not the biggest at-risk group. It\u2019s all so fluid and dicey right now because no one \u2014 not even the experts \u2014 seems to bring forth a fool-proof plan or solution on how to fight this and return to the lifestyle we enjoyed before. Precautionary steps are suggested in order to keep a virus from mushrooming. Many events that attract a large gathering have either been canceled or postponed. Hand sanitizer has become liquid gold overnight. As for the NBA, multiple options are on the table. They could, for instance, simply start the playoffs based on the current standings. The league is not only mindful of its role in helping to contain the outbreak, but also of its public perception. There remain potential liability issues and the desire to protect its own. The fallout from quiet arenas will be rather significant, obviously. Television will lose programming that it paid billions to broadcast. Teams will lose millions based on the money generated from ticket sales, parking, concessions and merchandise sales. But these teams are run by billionaires so the \u201closs\u201d is all relative. The real pain will be felt by those standing at the end of the domino effect of a suspended or canceled season. Think of folks from more humble lifestyles who work in the arenas, drive the taxis or hold the TV cameras. They don\u2019t make max money. It just shows how the game has such a widespread impact on thousands of people, those at the top of the chain (players, owners), those at the other end and the mass in the middle. On game night, everyone comes together, united by the love of the game, the chance to make money and the opportunity to just congregate and temporarily veer away from the souls who aren\u2019t part of the basketball ecosystem. These are the times to count blessings and realize how lucky we are to have something in common; sometimes you don\u2019t miss such good fortune until it\u2019s taken away from you. And now, the calendar watch begins. How long will this last? Well, that answer should come swiftly, maybe even before the weekend, if Silver and the owners believe the regular season can\u2019t be salvaged. Then it\u2019s all about saving the playoffs \u2026 Or maybe not. It\u2019s really anyone\u2019s guess right now, because the league\u2019s biggest nightmare already happened: At least one player became infected and he had contact with other players and coaches and reporters and who knows whomever else. At that point, there was no choice. \u201cThese are scary times,\u201d said Hornets coach James Borrego. More to the point, these times are unsettled. There\u2019s no blueprint on how to proceed during a health crisis where many who carry the virus are unknown. Everything is unprecedented. Therefore, the NBA resorted to the best way to stop any potential spread on its watch, and it was the right decision at the right time. For now, the ball doesn\u2019t make a sound. We may not see basketball in NBA arenas again until everyone can get tested as quickly as Rudy Gobert. Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Potential playoff preview in Dallas Luka Doncic and Co. seem set for a playoff spot and as it stands now, the No. 7-seeded Dallas Mavericks would face the No. 2-seeded Denver Nuggets in the first round. Conveniently enough, those teams meet tonight ( 8 ET, ESPN ) with Denver looking to ring up another recent win against a playoff-bound squad. This game could come down to the new-age big men on each squad. Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic has been solid since the All-Star break, but his 3-point shooting (17.6%) has not . Dallas\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis, conversely, has been sizzling since the All-Star break (23 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 3.0 apg, 3.0 bpg) and will be looking to atone for his 10-point game vs. Denver back on Oct. 29. 2. Surging Thunder, road-tested Jazz set to meet Only the Lakers, Pacers, Clippers and Bucks have a better win percentage since the All-Star break than the Thunder, who have gone from the No. 7 seed on Feb. 13 to the cusp of the No. 4 seed now. The Jazz have been more unpredictable this season ( as we detailed Monday ), but they\u2019ve got that No. 4 seed as they visit OKC next ( 8 ET, League Pass ). One area that Utah has been consistent in is winning on the road. At 20-13, the Jazz have the NBA\u2019s fifth-best road record . Additionally, their lineup of Jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, Georges Niang, Donovan Mitchell and Tony Bradley boasts one of the NBA\u2019s best offensive ratings on the road . With the season series tied 1-1 and one more matchup left (on April 13), tonight\u2019s game will be huge in late-season tie-breaker scenarios. 3. Embiid returns to lineup The Sixers are struggling lately, going 2-4 over their last six games \u2014 a stretch that has coincided with All-Star center Joel Embiid being out with a left shoulder injury. During that span, swingman Josh Richardson went out, too (back on March 1) and Philadelphia has lost some ground in the East playoff chase. Hope is on the horizon, though, as the Sixers host the Pistons next ( 7 ET, League Pass ). Embiid and Richardson will be available to play . It\u2019s not all good news, though, as Sixers All-Star guard Ben Simmons will be out at least another 3 weeks as he recovers from his back injury. 4. Playoff-hopeful Pelicans visit Kings The postseason dream may be fading for New Orleans and Sacramento, but it isn\u2019t out quite yet. Both teams are 3 1\/2 games behind No. 8-seeded Memphis as they meet tonight ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). Keep an eye on Lonzo Ball in this one as he\u2019s been hot over his last 15 games (13.7 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 7.9 apg and 43.9% shooting on 3-pointers) to keep the Pelicans in the playoff chase. Not to be outdone, the Kings\u2019 De\u2019Aaron Fox has picked it up since the All-Star break in just about every category (23.4 ppg, 5.8 apg, 1.2 spg) and his matchup with Ball should add intrigue to this game overall."},{"id":28256,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-play-without-fans","date":"2020-03-11","title":"Warriors to play without fans against Nets on Thursday","content":" The Golden State Warriors\u2019 game against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night will be played without fans in the arena in an effort to slow the coronavirus outbreak.

The amount of grit and determination instilled in our players, from both an accountability and attention to detail standpoint over this short period of time, has been met with admiration, respect and overall excitement throughout our entire locker room. We have already observed the impact he has made on our players through his first 10 games as head coach and we are looking forward to seeing just how far he can effectively drive our developing culture and lead this franchise into the future.\u201d Bickerstaff, who entered the season as the Cavaliers\u2019 associate head coach, was named the 23rd head coach in franchise history on Feb. 19. Since taking over the helm, the Cavs have a 5-5 record (.500, tied for sixth-best in East), which include consecutive season series sweeps over the Denver Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs. Under Bickerstaff, the Cavs have recorded three wins against above .500 teams (Miami, Philadelphia and Denver) and are averaging 111.4 points and 26.4 assists (eighth-best in NBA). The Wine & Gold also have the fifth-highest field goal percentage in the NBA since the All-Star break (.480). \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how excited I am for this opportunity to lead the Cavaliers and our promising and enthusiastic group of players that has been assembled here in Cleveland,\u201d said Bickerstaff. \u201cI want to thank Dan Gilbert and Koby Altman for having the trust and faith in my ability to coach this team, but also allowing me the freedom and endless resources to assist in creating a sustainable culture of winning and professional growth. Our players have done a phenomenal job of maintaining a high level of professionalism and growing maturity, of which I have been very appreciative. I also take great pride and consider it an honor and privilege to live and coach in this community with my family, in front of this fan base and for this franchise. It has truly been a blessing and I look forward to the journey ahead.\u201d Before coming to Cleveland, Bickerstaff was the head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018-19 season after serving as the interim head coach for the final 63 games of the 2017-18 Grizzlies campaign. Under Bickerstaff last season, Memphis recorded the third-best scoring defense in the NBA, holding opponents to 106.1 points per game. The Grizzlies also held an NBA-high 10 opponents under 90 points last season and went undefeated in those games. Memphis limited 17 opponents to under 40 percent shooting last season, which was tied with Utah for the second-most in the NBA. Prior to his stint with Memphis, Bickerstaff spent five seasons (2011-16) with the Houston Rockets, where he was elevated to interim head coach early in the 2015-16 season and guided the Rockets to a 37-34 finish to close the season with a postseason berth. Bickerstaff\u2019s additional experience includes four seasons (2007-11) with the Minnesota Timberwolves as an assistant coach and three seasons (2004-07) with the Charlotte Bobcats under his father and current Cavaliers Senior Basketball Advisor, Bernie Bickerstaff. The youngest assistant coach in the NBA at age 25 when he began with the Bobcats in 2004-05, Bickerstaff followed in the footsteps of his father, who was the youngest assistant coach when he joined the NBA at 29 years old in 1973. Bickerstaff served as director of operations for the University of Minnesota\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program before entering the NBA, overseeing all administrative areas of the program and assisting the coaching staff with recruiting, scouting and player development.

And LeBron James is officially the Benjamin Button of the NBA. And yes, the chase for the Kia MVP this season is most definitely not over. Did we learn anything else from the wild weekend tournament at Staples Center? LeBron and his Lakers faced down a couple of demons that has led to a distinct change in the MVP conversation and the championship debate . If there was any uncertainty about LeBron and the Lakers being worthy of first mention on both fronts, that doubt vanished in a matter of eight dominating quarters from the Lakers. They hadn\u2019t beaten the Bucks or the Clippers before this weekend, so there is no denying the significance of those triumphs in Lakerland. How these developments transform the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder will come into better focus in next Friday\u2019s edition of the Ladder. And that\u2019s after t hings were already tighter than you might think at the top. \u2022 Player(s) of the week: LeBron\u2019s monster weekend (he outplayed Antetokounmpo and Leonard in back-to-back games) led the reigning Player of the Month to the Player of the Week podium for the Western Conference. Toronto\u2019s Norman Powell, who has been on a tear of his own, is the Eastern Conference recipient. Don\u2019t forget about the Raptors come playoff time. The reigning NBA champs could very well play spoiler in the postseason, at least in the East. * * * Now, let\u2019s get to your emails about the Kia MVP Ladder.  (Editor\u2019s note: Portions of select questions have been condensed and edited). * * * From:  Jerry White March 9, 2020 | 6:35 a.m. I have always thought the MVP award leaned heavily on a team\u2019s success and a player\u2019s contribution to that success. If this is true,where is Chris Paul? OKC has had the 3rd best record in the league since the end of November and Paul is clearly the the only star on OKC. The Thunder are doing better this year than last even though they traded away Russell Westbrook \u2014 who is currently No. 10 in the MVP race this year \u2014 and Paul George (who finished third in the 2018-19 MVP voting). In effect, Paul has made up for both of their losses. How are the following players ahead of Paul? Both Westbrook and Harden are on a team that is fading. Luka Doncic\u2019s team has a poorer record than OKC and he has a better sidekick in Kristaps Porzingis. Neither Anthony Davis nor Khris Middleton has shown the ability to carry his team in their star\u2019s absence. Damian Lillard\u2019s team likely won\u2019t make the playoffs (and he has a good sidekick). Jayson Tatum is probably the Celtics\u2019 top player, but they need Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward for the team to run smoothly. Rudy Gobert has a better teammate than Paul, but the Jazz do not look as good as OKC. Jimmy Butler has done a lot, but the Heat are not the team the Thunder are. And Nikola Jokic and Denver were expected to be a contender \u2014 nobody thought OKC would be doing as well as they are. My MVP rankings: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo:  He is both so good and makes his team so much better. 2. Kawhi Leonard: He\u2019s had to carry the Clips for most of the year because George is just starting to regain his form. 3. Chris Paul: He has probably done more for his team than anybody but Giannis has done for theirs. 4. Jimmy Butler: Possibly rated too high, but Miami would be unlikely to reach the playoffs without him \u2014 let alone have a top four seed. 5. Luka Doncic: A key player, but the Mavs are about where they should be with Porzingis as a potent sidekick. 6. Nikola J okic: The top player for the third-place team in the West. 7. Anthony D avis: He looks better than this, but his floor time without LeBron says he may be too high. 8. James Harden: His stats have always been better than Houston\u2019s results. In the two previous years, his plus\/minus rating was always lower than Paul\u2019s was. 9. Jayson Tatum: Will be a top MVP contender with a little more experience. 10. Rudy Gobert: He\u2019s the Jazz\u2019s top player. 11. Pascal Siakam: He and Lowry, since Gasol is injured, are the top two for the East\u2019s No. 2 team. 12. Khris Middleton: The No. 2 player on the league\u2019s best team is a vital part of the Bucks\u2019 success. 13. Kemba Walker: He replaced an All-Star and made all the other players in Boston so much better. 14. Russell W estbrook: Plays extremely hard and would be ranked higher except his lack of outside shooting hurts the offense. * * * My response: This is extremely thorough and impressive work from you, Jerry. Your explanation for Paul at No. 4 on your list is valid. Outside of a handful of players, he\u2019s been as impactful as one player could be in terms of changing the bottom line for his team. Whether or not that makes him any more or less valuable than some of the other superstars on the list is subject to interpretation. There is no doubt he belongs on the list, it\u2019s a matter of where that is up for debate. From: Jeremiah Dowd March 9, 2020 | 12:22 a.m. I have a question about one 35-year-old, 17-year NBA veteran and current No. 2 on your latest Ladder. After watching LeBron James lead his team past the Bucks and Clippers, what more does he need to do to be considered the MVP? I understand that Giannis Antetokounmpo is doing amazing things, but I believe that LeBron\u2019s impact has been great in ways that I could\u2019ve never imagined. The plus-minus of when LeBron is on the floor versus when he is off is astonishing. On top of that, I\u2019m not sure anybody expected LeBron to be the monster he has been this season after last season\u2019s disaster. And with an all new team and coaching staff, I\u2019m not sure anybody expected the Lakers to be so successful as quickly as they have been. So, for holding everything together (and excelling) in the face of lack of continuity, \u201cold age\u201d, and doubt from the outside, I believe that LeBron deserves to be the MVP. * * * My response: If you watched that 35-year-old, 17-year NBA veteran over the weekend, you saw exactly what he needed to do. Not every voter will be swayed by one monstrous weekend, but I suspect there will be some who point to those events as the turning point in the race. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or wrong, just pointing out that each voter brings their own values to the voting process. What resonates for some might not for others (and vice versa). But remember that weekend double in a few weeks when the ballots are due. I guarantee you plenty of voters will. From:  Dennis March 3, 2020 | 8:43 p.m. That (last MVP Ladder) was hard to read, Sekou. I always thought there was too much narrative for LeBron, but this year he doesn\u2019t need a narrative. He gives the Lakers just what they need night in and night out .As good as Davis has been throughout his career, it was Rondo who got him into the playoffs (in New Orleans). I could never see him leading a team and being an MVP of the league. * * * My response: I\u2019ve been saying it all season, Dennis. The narratives tend to take care of themselves over the course of an 82-game season. If a player operates at that consistently elite level and his team rides the wave with him, entry into the Kia MVP conversation usually follows. From:  Charles Blalock March 3, 2020 | 5:09 p.m. What about \u201cThe Beard?\u201d He is the best one-on-one player of all time and perhaps the best offensive player in history. Now he\u2019s with Westbrook, who has been crazy ever since the the small-ball lineup started. Giannis is good because of his length, speed and athleticism, but Harden is more skilled. * * * My response: I get the argument, Charles. Harden is an offensive machine, no doubt about it. There\u2019s another side to the game that requires plenty of skill and effort as well. But we don\u2019t seem to use that in calculating the MVP worthiness of some, which I think is a half-baked argument. There\u2019s a scoring title for the man who scores the most points. That doesn\u2019t make said player an automatic for MVP. From:  Jackson Straulin March 3, 2020 | 3:48 p.m. As a lifelong Bucks fan, I am of course having the time of my life this season watching them play at such a high caliber. Watching Giannis\u2019 dominance on both ends of the floor and his growth throughout his career has been astounding to be a part of. My argument for why he should be over LeBron is multifaceted. For starters, I believe that there is a little bit too much weight put on LeBron being in his 17th season and I don\u2019t think that should weigh in to this season\u2019s debate. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I put LeBron second to Michael Jordan in career comparisons. But, him doing this in his 17th season has more to do with his amazing career and less to do with the race to be the MVP to his team. I also agree that the addition of Davis has helped the Lakers greatly this season, as Khris Middleton has done for the Bucks (but Middleton is no AD). Y es, the Bucks still look like a top-tier team with Giannis off the floor, but the energy and confidence having Antetokounmpo on a team and what he has been able to do the past two seasons has a lot to do with that. I think Giannis has shown more dominance in nearly every facet of his game than LeBron this season and, at this point in the season, deserves the MVP more. * * * My response: Bury the lead next time, Jackson, and your argument for Giannis telegraphed in a way that gives away your point. You don\u2019t have to be a Bucks fans to make a case for Giannis. Just like you don\u2019t have to be a fan of any one team to recognize the guys who are having the most outstanding seasons in the league. I do love the passion for your team. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I completely understand it and know it has to be sweet to see your guy come from such humble basketball beginnings to now be talked about as one of the game\u2019s greats. Whatever happens with the rest of the season, it\u2019s already been a heck of a ride for the fans of \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d. From: Vaughn Miller Jr March 3, 2020 | 11:51 a.m. Giannis and LeBron are very close in statistics so I think other factors should decide MVP, not stats. LeBron doesn\u2019t average as many points or rebounds as Giannis because he splits those stats with Anthony Davis. Giannis doesn\u2019t have anyone else take away touches or rebounds unless he needs them to. LeBron has found a way to let AD eat, get his own numbers, and lead the Lakers to the No. 1 seed in possibly the toughest conference in NBA history. The Eastern Conference is so weak right now it\u2019s not even funny. LeBron has recorded 30-point triple-doubles Denver and New Orleans and Giannis scores 40 and 20 in 35 minutes against Charlotte! New Orleans is not even a West playoff team, but they would be No. 7 in the East! Giannis plays bad teams twice as often as LeBron, and he gets to grab every rebound and shoot every shot without having to get anyone involved. The Lakers without LeBron would be No. 10 in the West. The Bucks without Giannis are a No. 4 or 5 seed in the East. Therefore, LeBron James is the MVP of the NBA. * * * My response: I don\u2019t know, Vaughn. The East doesn\u2019t seem as weak as you (and many others) suggest. Six-deep is rather stout and I\u2019ll grant you No. 7-15 are a bit tender right now. But this notion that which side of the league you play on should be a determining factor in the MVP race isn\u2019t one I subscribe to. I should be able to make the case for whomever I think the winner should be without using that category. From:  Anthony L March 4, 2020 | 10:10 a.m. I\u2019m emailing to let you know that as a fan of the game of basketball, I thought that it was completely unfair that LeBron was given the February Player of the Month award over Russell Westbrook. LeBron has been playing at a phenomenal level this season, but during the month of February, Westbrook was a notch higher in terms of how he was able to carry the Rockets to an 8-1 record. He averaged 33.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game while shooting 54.9% and had a higher true shooting percentage than James. He also led the Rockets to an impressive win over the Lakers that month, which helps prove why he deserved the Player of the Month award. I understand the media is infatuated with LeBron is trying to push this agenda that it\u2019s a close race between LeBron and Giannis for MVP, but this isn\u2019t the way to do it. Robbing Westbrook of a POTM when YOU KNOW he clearly deserved it over LeBron is absolutely WRONG. You don;t have to sabotage what other players are doing just to push a narrative about LeBron still being great in his 17th season. You have ignored the contributions of Anthony Davis just to prop up LeBron like he\u2019s doing it all by himself and that is unfair. You have to put away your bias towards LeBron and do the right thing. I didn\u2019t agree with Jayson Tatum winning the East Player of the Month over Antetokounmpo. You and the rest of the media pundits are flat out wrong on this and its absolutely disgraceful. You\u2019re not fooling fans with your bias and its making the people think more and more that the NBA is rigged. You robbed Westbrook of that award \u2026 there\u2019s no integrity in the world of journalism and sports media anymore. SMH! My response:  The media has nothing to do with the Player of the Week award. Oh, the conspiracy theories never fade away \u2026 SMH! From:  Jay-R March 4, 2020 | 10:35 a.m. Hi I\u2019m Jay-R from the Philippines. I love The Greek Freak \u2014 he is one of a kind, but The King should reign supreme this season. The Greek Freak is young, long, strong and athletic. He\u2019s in the prime of his physical gifts which he effectively translates to his stats and this is the time he should be dominating, statistically. He has an insane PER and all, but it is not everything. The Bucks have built organically and have come to their success piece by piece \u2014 not just because of Antetokounmpo. He is the centerpiece and the argument is that he is better now than his he was in his MVP season of 2018-19. LeBron is on a different level \u2014 he\u2019s in his own spectrum, honestly. He\u2019s not as athletic as he once was, but his body of work made us forget he is getting old. He\u2019s dominating with his skills not just athleticism, and that amazes me more. He\u2019s just as unguardable as Giannis or any other superstar and he successfully hides his weakness with his skills. The Lakers are succeeding because he made them gel. Yes, he does have Anthony Davis alongside him, but take LeBron off the Lakers and they\u2019d be more or less the Pelicans. LeBron is like the ECU of a car: what is the use of a 1000 horsepower engine without the ECU? Maybe a lot of people in the media is still having a greatness hangover, but if the narrative is Giannis\u2019 season is better than his last one, what about that same narrative for LeBron? In his 17th season, LeBron is leading the league in assists, has logged 13 triple-doubles and done all this with basically a new set of teammates. He\u2019s made the Lakers look like they\u2019ve been playing together for years and helped them to the second-best record in the NBA. Now, what narrative should we still want? Here\u2019s my MVP list: 1. LeBron James 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Luka Doncic 5. James Harden * * * My response: Your argument and list are fine, Nilo. LeBron is on a different level than we\u2019ve ever seen a superstar this deep int his career. That\u2019s impressive enough. I\u2019m sure there are AD fans who would argue that he\u2019s done as much for the Lakers this season and has actually been the key to LeBron operating at the level he has this season. I know better than to go there. Shout out to you and all the NBA fans in the Philippines \u2026 I know you all love the game with a passion. From:  Neel Aggarwal March 4, 2020 | 12 p.m. I\u2019m from India and I agree with your list, but my only concern is Anthony Davis. I\u2019m not a Lakers fan, but his stats (26.9 ppg, 9.5 rpg and 3.2 apg) are quite good considering his PF position. The improvement in his game over the years as he joined the Lakers is also visible. The role he\u2019s playing for his team is really crucial and the support that LeBron has been getting from Davis is kinda ignored. The duo is respected, but we often forget that AD is the one who has been a moral support for LeBron all along this season. Because of that, LeBron has been at the top of his game. Davis may not deserve one of the top three spots, but I think he definitely deserves to be in the top 5 * * * My response:  As I mentioned to Jay-R above, I knew someone would make the AD argument. We have more empirical data to suggest that LeBron (historically and in the flesh) brings the winning edge in more ways than AD does. But strong arguments can be made for both guys this season. I\u2019ve always been a believer that the player who shoulders the bulk of the shot and play creation responsibility tends to be the more valuable one, by virtue of what\u2019s being asked of him. From: E mmett Dunn March 4, 2020 | 11:30 p.m. Let me start by saying this: has there ever been an MVP, nevermind a candidate, who hasn\u2019t led his team in points, rebounds, blocks, steals, field goal percentage or 3-point percentage? LeBron is still a fantastic player, but to even consider him to be anywhere near Giannis right now is asinine. I really hope Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t robbed of this award because of the narrative that is growing, and growing exponentially. My ladder as of March 4: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo GAP BIGGER THAN MOUNT EVEREST 2. James Harden 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Anthony Davis 5. LeBron 6. Russell Westbrook 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Luka Doncic 9. Jayson Tatum 10. Damian Lillard Seeing as LeBron just won Player of the Month over Westbrook, I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s too late and that the league and media have already begun pushing him forward. I truly want to know why he is as high as he is for you, despite the fact Anthony Davis leads the Lakers in almost all major categories. Not trying to sound hateful at all BTW \u2026 I love your work. * * * My response: I don\u2019t know about the size of that gap between the top two guys, Emmett. In fact, I am sure it\u2019s much closer than that and actually has been for quite some time. I\u2019ve had conversations with some of my media brethren who feel like this race remains out of reach for anyone other than Giannis. I don\u2019t agree with that. We have enough basketball left to play this season for gaps to be closed. From:  Kang Mufasared March 7, 2020 | 5:05 p.m. I\u2019m writing to you again about LeBron James, this season\u2019s MVP, and, in my opinion, the greatest player of all time. No player reflects the character of the game \u2014 team play \u2014 more than him. The MVP race is between LeBron and Giannis \u2014 not Kawhi and LeBron \u2014 no matter what happens against the Clippers. LeBron clearly established in the game against the Bucks who the MVP is by winning the individual battle and the game itself, too. After watching Giannis physically abuse Davis, LeBron matched up against Giannis, which changed the look and feel of the whole game. Giannis still scored, but the physicality that we are accustomed to seeing from Giannis was matched by LeBron, thus lessening the impact of Antetokounmpo\u2019s scoring. LeBron outplayed him, outscored him and won the game. By doing so, LeBron snatched the MVP from Giannis. This attempt to remove age from the narrative of determining the MVP is hypocritical and nonsensical. Once you see a 35-year-old man in his 17th season outplay and defeat the reigning 25-year-old MVP you can\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t see it. The MVP discussion has shifted. Those who say age doesn\u2019t matter are lying to themselves. If you played basketball in any capacity, you know that you can\u2019t at 35 do what you did at 25 because age matters. You have to work harder at 35 to play at an elite level than you do at 25. Giannis is doing what is expected given his skill set, and his age. LeBron however, at 35, is doing the unexpected.  * * * My response: Thanks for the detail, Kang, as context always helps. While I can see your argument for MVP this season, I\u2019ll reserve a seat for you in our GOAT debate forum in the future. For the record, the age argument for LeBron makes sense. What he\u2019s doing at 35 (and this deep in his career) is an amazing feat. That said, I don\u2019t know if a player\u2019s age (whether he\u2019s 21 like Luka or 35 like LeBron) should be used to swing the vote one way or another. From:  Martin Cole March 6, 2020 | 9:20 p.m. You can\u2019t be playing part of the time and be an MVP candidate, especially when you have morphed from the best two-way player to an offensive player. Getting up for the Lakers and giving up 120-plus points to lesser teams is not impressive. Also, when did Doc become an elite coach? * * * My response: Thanks, Martin, and I assume you are speaking about Kawhi Leonard. As for Doc Rivers, he became an elite coach when he blended a remade Boston team \u2014 one that featured Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen \u2014 and turned it into a 66-win juggernaut that won the title in their first season together. He\u2019s been an elite coach ever since.  * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Rockets try to right their ship Four straight losses have Houston reeling as it hosts Minnesota next ( 8 ET, League Pass ) in what will be Rockets forward Robert Covington\u2019s first game against his old team . While warm fuzzies are nice, a win would be better for the Rockets, who, despite their struggles are just 1 1\/2 games behind the Jazz for the No. 4 seed. To get there, as our John Schuhmann notes , James Harden and Russell Westbrook have to get back on track. During the skid, Harden is 8-for-42 on 3-pointers while Westbrook is 20-for-38 on shots in the restricted area. 2. Pacers heating up in East Indiana has won eight of its last 10 games, but a closer look reveals those two losses \u2014 to Eastern Conference leaders Milwaukee ( on March 4 ) and Toronto ( on Feb. 23 ) \u2014 were not pleasant. As solid as the Pacers have been at times this season, they are a combined 2-6 against the Bucks and Raptors in 2019-20. A date with Boston is next ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and Indiana can wrap up a playoff berth with a win or a Wizards loss as a logjam is beginning to form in the No. 3-5 seeds in the East. Indiana is No. 5, but trails No. 4 Miami by two games and is three games behind No. 3 Boston. 3. Spurs\u2019 playoff hopes on ropes? Expecting a Gregg Popovich-led San Antonio team to roll over and give up is a fool\u2019s errand, something Dallas is well aware of even as it seeks its first season-series sweep of the Spurs in franchise history ( 8 ET, TNT ). The Spurs are on decidedly thin playoff ice, and not just because they are five games behind the No. 8-seeded Grizzlies with 20 games to play. San Antonio is 3-5 since the All-Star break and is coming off back-to-back disappointing losses to the Cavaliers and Nets. Defense remains the Spurs\u2019 biggest issue, though. They\u2019re 25th in Defensive Rating and haven\u2019t exactly showed big signs of improvement since the All-Star break, ranking 21st in Defensive Rating since then. 4. Clippers\u2019 new faces getting acclimated No one can accuse the LA Clippers of being stagnant with their roster this season. Aside from adding Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson late last month, the Clippers made another move on Monday in adding former Kia Defensive Player of the Year Joakim Noah . He\u2019ll join a frontcourt that is trying to figure out its rotation for the playoffs as the Clippers visit the Warriors next ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). This game isn\u2019t quite the showdown of West playoff teams it was last year, but with Stephen Curry healthy and Patrick Beverley always in the mix for LA, that makes for an exciting matchup to watch at Chase Center tonight. 5. On this date in 2004: McGrady scores 62 in win The Orlando Magic of 2003-04 had a rough season, finishing 21-61 and missing the playoffs. But for one night at least, their then-superstar Tracy McGrady and his team looked like world-beaters. On March 10, 2004, McGrady became the first player in more than four years to eclipse 60 points, going for a staggering 62 as the Magic posted a 108-99 victory against the Washington Wizards. He made 20-of-37 shots, including 5-of-14 from 3-point range, and 17-of-26 free throws, missing a chance at becoming just the then-fifth player to score 70.

This matchup represents one of several potential previews for the postseason. Kristaps Porzingis and the Dallas Mavericks host Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday on ESPN ( 8 ET ), while reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo takes on Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics on Thursday in the first game of a TNT doubleheader ( 8 ET ). We should also see star point guards Ja Morant and Damian Lillard go at it Thursday night ( 10 ET, League Pass ). * * * \u2022 Thursday, March 12 (10:30 ET, TNT)  Last regular season meeting: Feb. 6, 2020. It is a difficult start to the week for the Rockets, who on Sunday dropped their fourth game in seven days to a team below .500 (Orlando). Still, we could see this matchup in the playoffs. LeBron James is 4-1 against James Harden in the postseason, where the latter\u2019s numbers drop dramatically (12.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists) when he\u2019s matched with the former. The Lakers enter the week having passed major tests against title contenders in Milwaukee and the LA Clippers, and this game represents an equal task. Harden and James appear to be moving in opposite directions as of late regarding performance. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Thursday, March 12 (8 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 16, 2020. The banged-up Celtics need a spark against the equally reeling Bucks, who dropped two outings over the weekend without the services of Giannis Antetokounmpo. He recently suffered a minor joint capsule sprain in his left knee Friday against the Lakers. The injury kept Antetokounmpo out Monday against the Denver Nuggets, which gives him a couple days to rest before the Celtics come to town. Antetokounmpo\u2019s Bucks have come out on top in three of the last four meetings against Tatum and the Celtics. We could end up seeing this matchup in the postseason as well, where Antetokounmpo holds a 7-5 advantage over Tatum. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Thursday, March 12 (10 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 12, 2020.  Damian Lillard comes into this one with fresh legs after missing six games with a right groin strain, and he\u2019ll need them facing rookie superstar Ja Morant. The first time these players clashed, Morant and the Grizzlies came out winners despite him shooting 9 of 23 from the floor and 0 of 5 on 3-pointers. Lillard committed four turnovers in that game, despite matching Morant\u2019s production statistically. Morant bested fellow rookie star Trae Young in two matchups last week, so Morant should be plenty prepared for this one. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Tuesday, March 10 (10:30 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Oct. 24, 2019.  Patrick Beverley once said \u201cSteph\u2019s like a brother,\u201d and with that, naturally, comes a rivalry. Beverley\u2019s offensive production in this series is limited, but he managed to tally five steals the last time these players squared off. Curry and Golden State own a lopsided advantage in this series, but the Warriors will see their current seven-year playoff streak come to an end this spring. Curry made his long-awaited return on Thursday after missing 58 games with a broken left hand, but the Warriors held him out of Saturday\u2019s game against Philadelphia due to flu-like symptoms. Warriors\u2019 coach Steve Kerr said Curry is questionable to play in this one. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Wednesday, Mar. 11 (8 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Jan. 8, 2020. Before failing to reach double-figures in scoring for the first time since early December on Saturday in a loss to Cleveland, Jokic had averaged more than 20 points and 10 rebounds over the previous 12 games. Porzingis is also coming off a rough outing (nine points and eight rebounds) after averaging 32.7 points, 12 rebounds and 4.7 blocks in the three games prior to Sunday\u2019s loss to Indiana. Jokic has won three of the last five games in this series, and he logged a triple-double in the last meeting despite Porzingis coming away with the win after shooting 4 of 14 from the floor and 1 of 8 from deep. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Friday, March 13 (9 ET, NBA League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Haven\u2019t met yet.  It\u2019s hard to match Williamson up with Bogdanovic solely in this one because you know the Jazz will need to utilize two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert to help neutralize the electrifying Pelicans rookie. This outing represents the first meeting between these players. The Pelicans have posted at least 28 assists in 11 consecutive games with Williamson serving as the recipient for several of them. New Orleans is 11-7 over their last 20 games going into Wednesday\u2019s game against the Kings, and the Pelicans are now within striking distance of the eighth seed. * * * Michael C.

Nuggets seek season-series sweep of Bucks A matchup tonight between two of the NBA\u2019s best teams \u2014 the Milwaukee Bucks and Denver Nuggets ( 9 ET, NBA TV ) \u2014 will sadly be lacking in some star power since the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo (left knee sprain) is out . That absence shouldn\u2019t limit the intensity factor for Denver, though, which is suddenly in a bit of a fight with Utah and Oklahoma City for the Northwest Division crown. While the Nuggets beat a fully-stocked Bucks team back in late January, Denver\u2019s defense has hit the skids since the All-Star break with a 117.0 Defensive Rating ( 29th in the NBA in that span). Milwaukee\u2019s offense hasn\u2019t been great since then, either, ( 109.0 Offensive Rating ), so this could be a game of two teams trying to see who can get back on track first. 2. Have Rockets hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019? Much like the Boston Celtics (see No. 3), the Houston Rockets were feeling fresh and frisky after the All-Star break thanks to their five-game win streak. How quickly that all has changed after an 0-4 run that included losses to the playoff-contending Orlando Magic and lowly Charlotte Hornets over the weekend. After Sunday\u2019s loss to the Magic, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni hoped this was, perhaps, the big valley of the season for Houston and it will pull itself out if this skid soon. The West standings wait for no team, as Houston has learned: it went from the No. 5 seed on Friday to the No. 6 seed as of this morning. 3. Celtics trying to find some answers After a Feb. 26 win in Salt Lake City, the Boston Celtics were looking like a legit threat to swipe the No. 2 seed (and the Atlantic Division lead) from the Toronto Raptors. Back then, the Celtics were 1 game back of Toronto in the standings and had won three of four games to start their post-All-Star break schedule. A 1-4 mark since then \u2014 which includes last night\u2019s heartbreaking loss to the Thunder \u2014 has Boston suddenly in a mini-skid. There\u2019s no panic, mind you, for the Celtics. But there\u2019s also a sense of urgency to turn things around as the season wanes. 4. Big test awaits Jazz on road Since it ran off 19 wins in 21 games from mid-December to late January, Utah has been wildly inconsistent. It followed that run with a five-game skid \u2026 then a four-game win streak \u2026 then a four-game skid \u2026 and now, a five-game win streak. The Jazz\u2019s road swing through the East was a success and Toronto visits Salt Lake City next ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ), where Utah has seen a fantastic Defensive Rating at home this season ( 104.6 ) fall to putrid levels since the All-Star break ( 120.6 ). Before we get too down on the Jazz, though, know that Mike Conley is, perhaps at last getting into a groove in Utah. Over his last eight games, Conley is averaging 15.1 ppg and 4.8 apg while, more importantly, shooting much better (46.8% overall; 41.7% on 3-pointers)."},{"id":28320,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kuzma-crowns-lebron-will-lakers-wear-real-one","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Will LeBron James, Lakers be crowned at season's end?","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 When LeBron James finally finished the job Sunday, then punched the time clock and and went to the jubilant Lakers bench for good, Kyle Kuzma was waiting for him and couldn\u2019t resist. Kuz cupped his hands in a circle and then fitted them around LeBron\u2019s head. Maybe it is madness in March to crown LeBron and, by extension, the Lakers so soon. And yet there\u2019s no denying the man and the team just changed the NBA conversation, and perhaps the pecking order, in a whiplash-quick two-game span. The sprint to the Kia MVP trophy and the jog to the NBA championship both gained some giddy-up when Giannis Antetokounmpo was conquered by the Lakers on Friday , and then the Clippers were quieted 112-103 on Sunday . If LeBron hauls in the hardware and then paints the town purple and gold in late June, then reflecting on this past weekend will reveal the flash point when he began to distance himself from the limited field in a pair of tight races. We must pause to acknowledge what Lakers coach Frank Vogel said is largely and historically true: \u201cWe do keep these regular-season games in perspective and there\u2019s a lot of factors that go into these games that don\u2019t really matter come playoff time, whether you win or lose.\u201d But these weren\u2019t your ordinary two-games-out-of-82. These pair of Lakers victories carried weight, and those who disagree only needed to see and hear LeBron\u2019s reaction immediately after he iced the Clippers with a forceful layup in the final minute. He doesn\u2019t punch his chest and then the air and screams after flicking aside, say, the Suns. Of course not. Giannis and the Bucks came to L.A. with the league\u2019s best record and cockiest strut. Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers also swaggered their way into Staples Center, flush with the knowledge that they\u2019d beaten the Lakers twice in their only two previous meetings. But then, *poof* LeBron rewrote the script \u2014 and furiously so, outplaying the projected MVP front-runner Giannis and then closing out the Clippers with a dominant finish. Doc Rivers, the Clippers coach, called LeBron \u201cphenomenal\u201d in his team\u2019s loss, the term pretty much having defined LeBron\u2019s entire weekend. It would be naive to think LeBron wasn\u2019t lasered on the task at hand and satisfied by the result. There was much to be gained by thwarting the unofficial Best Player In The Game (that would be Giannis) and then Biggest Threat To The Lakers (that would be the Clippers) because suddenly, this is all about LeBron yet again \u2014 his time, his opportunity, his twin trophies to lose. There is suspense for the MVP because Giannis is gimpy. The Bucks announced he\u2019ll miss the next two games with a knee sprain, suffered Friday. And only a fool would think the Bucks will risk further harm to Giannis in the final month of the regular season by throwing him in an intense MVP pursuit. He already won one last year. Since the Bucks are comfortably ahead of everyone in the East, they\u2019ll sell him on the big picture and aim the pursuit toward something he hasn\u2019t won: a championship. If LeBron finishes strong and the Lakers\u2019 regular-season record is almost identical \u2014 they\u2019re just three games behind Milwaukee \u2014 don\u2019t you suspect the folks who vote on these things might get a bit sentimental? LeBron is, after all, a 35-year-old whose debut season with the Lakers in 2019-20 was ruined by injury. \u201cI prepared by body and my mind to endure anything,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cMy responsibility was to put this team in position to win. It shows I\u2019m not slowing down at this stage of my career. I put a lot of work into my game.\u201d LeBron added: \u201cMight\u2019ve lost a step here or there but when your mind is sharp, it can compensate for those things.\u201d He was too smart and too sharp for the Clippers. He attacked the rim, and when the defense sagged, he found the open man \u2014 essentially, the same approach as he\u2019s had all season, just on the next level. LeBron left it to Anthony Davis (30 points, eight rebounds) to supply the punch for three quarters before becoming the closer with 12 points in the fourth. The final tally for LeBron was 28 points, seven rebounds and nine assists \u2026 all of which came less than 72 hours after he dropped 37-8-8 on the Bucks. Avery Bradley said: \u201cLeBron just set the tone.\u201d Rivers explained: \u201cHe got to the rim. If you let him get to the basket, then he\u2019s too good.\u201d Vogel gushed: \u201cHe just dominated both games in the stretch \u2026 his best weekend in a Laker uniform. He was just too much for them.\u201d The other encouraging sign for the Lakers was Davis, who took over the game for stretches, especially while LeBron rested. The Lakers assigned smaller players on Leonard and then when he attacked the basket, Davis was quick to bring the rotating double team. Leonard scored 27 points, but isn\u2019t on LeBron\u2019s level as a passer out of traps and it showed \u2014 Kawhi had as many assists Sunday as a dead man. Paul George was trouble (31 points) much of the afternoon but scored only two points in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the Lakers surprisingly won the battle of the supporting casts: Bradley (24 points) drilled six 3-pointers while Lou Williams and Pat Beverley, assigned to guard Bradley, were mainly dreadful on both ends (combining for 10 points). \u201cWe have a lot of growth and we\u2019re going to keep growing,\u201d said Rivers optimistically. The Clippers, who\u2019ve dealt with nagging injuries and missing players for much of the season, had better hope so. Should they remain healthy and once they incorporate newcomer Marcus Morris into their system \u2014 he missed all nine of his shots against the Lakers \u2014 the Clippers will be the formidable team the Lakers expected to see Sunday, but didn\u2019t. Davis, for one, says the basketball world will be a better one if it\u2019s L.A. vs. LA at some point in the playoffs. \u201cThose games would be scrappy, defensive-minded, you coming out of games with scratches, just like this one,\u201d he said. He then threw a bit of shade toward the Clippers\u2019 earlier two wins in the matchup: \u201cThe first two games we beat ourselves. This one, we played closer to our standards.\u201d Said Bradley: \u201cWe knew we could compete with those guys.\u201d There is no new and refreshing development in the Lakers\u2019 matchup with the Clippers, nor their standing within the league, without LeBron declaring so. That\u2019s what happened on Friday and Sunday, when a four-time former MVP exercised his will and rolled back his inner clock to remind everyone where he stood (in case anyone forgot). And so James\u2019 twin pursuit now begins in earnest: for a fifth MVP and also a fourth championship with his third team. Both are in sight and realistic for LeBron, and that double would be a feat for the aged. Kuzma just put an imaginary crown on the man\u2019s head. Was that premature? In the next few months, we\u2019ll see if anyone is capable of knocking it off before the real one settles into place. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The league circulated a memo to its teams Friday telling them to prepare in case it becomes necessary to play games without fans or media, as sports leagues in Europe have already done. The memo detailed potential actions that teams might need to take \u201cif it were to become necessary to play a game with only essential staff present.\u201d But when James was asked about that possibility after he scored 37 points in his Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 113-103 win over the league-leading Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night, the NBA\u2019s leading active scorer was definitive. \u201cWe play games without the fans? Nah, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d James said. \u201cI ain\u2019t playing if I ain\u2019t got the fans in the crowd. That\u2019s who I play for. I play for my teammates, and I play for the fans.

They can do what they want to do.\u201d The memo, obtained by The Associated Press , says teams should identify which team and arena people would be necessary to conduct games, and be able to communicate quickly with non-essential staff, as well as ticket holders and corporate partners. Teams should also be prepared \u201cfor the possibility of implementing temperature checks on players, team staff, referees, and anyone else who is essential to conducting such a game in the team\u2019s arena.\u201d Contents of the memo were first reported by The Athletic. The letter also says teams should plan for scenarios in which media could attend games under revised media policies. The league had already sent a memo to teams this week offering 10 recommendations to players with hopes of decreasing risks of getting the virus \u2014 among them, not taking items such as pens, markers, balls and jerseys from autograph seekers. An NCAA Division III men\u2019s basketball tournament game on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, was played in an empty gym Friday in what was believed to be the first U.S. sports event held without fans because of the coronavirus, though an NCAA COVID-19 advisory panel said it is \u201cnot recommending cancellation or public spacing of athletic and related events scheduled to occur in public spaces across the United States.\u201d ___ AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report."},{"id":28306,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brooklyn-nets-kenny-atkinson-part-ways","date":"2020-03-07","title":"Brooklyn Nets, coach Kenny Atkinson mutually agree to part ways","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kenny Atkinson won\u2019t have the chance to coach Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving together in Brooklyn. The Nets and their coach decided his influence with the team ran out before that pair could get started. The Nets surprisingly split with their coach Saturday, even as they remain on track for a second consecutive playoff berth. The announcement came less than 12 hours after Atkinson guided the Nets to a 139-120 rout of San Antonio. General manager Sean Marks said he and Atkinson had been talking long before that about what was best for the Nets, and they finally concluded it wasn\u2019t their fourth-year coach. \u201cHe has taken us to where we stand today and I think the discussions that he and I had were what\u2019s best for the Nets for a variety of different reasons, which I don\u2019t think either one of us will get into,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut it\u2019s time for another voice in the locker room and it\u2019s time that we both part ways.\u201d Marks offered no specifics but said the decision had nothing to do with Durant, Irving or any other players on the roster. Rather, he said, it was he and Atkinson deciding that the coach who took the Nets from the bottom of the NBA to the playoffs wasn\u2019t the guy who could take them any further \u2014 even though Marks said Atkinson had proven himself as an NBA coach. \u201cBut I think we\u2019d both come to realize that it ran its course here and you wish it could have lasted much, much longer, but these are the tough decisions that we both basically have to have,\u201d Marks said. Marks acknowledged that the decision was surprising, but he called it amicable and believed he, Atkinson and ownership were all at peace with it. Marks informed the players by text message Saturday morning and then discussed the decision with them at the team\u2019s training facility. Players who had been here in previous seasons didn\u2019t sense that Atkinson wasn\u2019t getting through anymore but also acknowledged that things have changed in Brooklyn this season. \u201cI think you go across this league and you talk to every coach and every player,\u201d forward Joe Harris said, \u201cand dealing with a young, up-and-coming team is much different than coaching superstar players, and everybody kind of realizes that it\u2019s a much different dynamic. And I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re in this position right now, but it is different.\u201d Assistant Jacque Vaughn will serve as coach for the rest of the season. He coached Orlando for two-plus seasons, from 2012-15. The Nets are in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. Atkinson was 118-190 in 3 1\/2 seasons of his first NBA head coaching job. They returned to the postseason last year and are five games clear of ninth-place Washington despite a 28-34 record. That comes despite only 20 games from Irving and none from Durant, the two superstars they signed last summer to bring heightened expectations to Brooklyn. But the Nets had ruled out Durant from the start as he recovers from Achilles tendon surgery, and Irving is sidelined for the season after having shoulder surgery. The Nets had struggled since the All-Star break, with their victory Friday just their second in seven games. Brooklyn was ripped 118-79 at home by Memphis in its previous game. Atkinson then made a lineup change and the Nets responded against the Spurs with their best offensive performance of the season, putting eight players in double figures. Atkinson is a Long Island native who had been an assistant coach with Atlanta and New York when Marks hired him as Nets coach in April 2016. That came with the Nets were mired near the bottom of the NBA as they tried to dig their way out of damage following a 2013 trade with Boston, in which they acquired Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce but gave up years of assets and salary-cap flexibility. Brooklyn went 20-62 in Atkinson\u2019s first season, 28-54 the next and nothing much was expected last season. But the Nets surged to a 42-40 finish, earning their first playoff spot since 2015, and Atkinson was credited with helping D\u2019Angelo Russell reach his first All-Star Game, and Spencer Dinwiddie grow from a Development League player to a third-place finisher in voting for the Sixth Man award. The signings of Durant and Irving brought unprecedented attention since the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012, along with talk of 50-win seasons and contending for titles. Durant mentioned his respect for Atkinson\u2019s work as one reason for choosing the Nets after leaving Golden State. But Irving began having trouble with his right shoulder in early November and eventually had to miss nearly two months, never allowing the Nets to build much chemistry on a roster that had made a number of other changes. Holdover Caris LeVert was asked if he got the sense that Atkinson wasn\u2019t reaching this group the same way. \u201cI never really did, but you know we had a lot of new guys this year so you never really know how that goes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know with me, our relationship was extremely strong.\u201d"},{"id":28311,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/steve-clifford-exits-magic-timberwolves-illness","date":"2020-03-07","title":"Magic coach Steve Clifford (illness) exits game vs. Timberwolves","content":"The Magic, in Minnesota to play the Timberwolves, had to manage without head coach Steve Clifford for much of the second half on Friday, after he came down with an illness in the third quarter.

The NBA issued the following statement: * * * The Mavericks\u2019 protest centered on a successful field goal by Atlanta\u2019s John Collins as a whistle was blown for goaltending by the Mavericks late in the fourth quarter. The goaltending call was overturned on instant replay review, but the Replay Center Official ruled that Collins\u2019 goal should be scored because he was in the act of shooting at the time the goaltending call was made. Dallas contends that the officials misapplied the playing rules by allowing the basket. Immediately after the game ended, Mr. Cuban walked onto the court and approached game officials shaking his head and directing comments toward them. This marked the second time he walked onto the court to challenge a call during the game. Following the game, Mr. Cuban spoke to reporters in the arena and tweeted several times that night and into the next day with comments that were highly critical, personal and demeaning to the league and its officiating staff. The next day, Dallas filed its protest of the game pursuant to league rules. Over the course of the next several days, Mr. Cuban continued his public criticism of NBA officiating. After a comprehensive investigation, Commissioner Silver determined there was no misapplication of the playing rules. The Replay Center Official correctly understood the rules to require that Collins\u2019 basket count if he was in the act of shooting when the goaltending call was made. The Replay Center Official also correctly followed the established process of replay review. The league\u2019s investigation included an analysis of the game footage showing that the whistle began to sound one-fifteenth of a second before Collins gained possession of the ball. However, it is well-established by prior NBA protest decisions that a factual determination by game officials \u2013 including replay officials \u2013 that is shown in a post-game review to be incorrect is not a misapplication of the playing rules. While officials strive to get every call right, games cannot be replayed when, after the fact and free from the need to make rulings in real time, a different judgment about events on the playing floor can be made. For these reasons, Commissioner Silver found that the extraordinary remedy of granting a game protest and replaying the last portion of a completed game was not warranted. The NBA further determined that Mr. Cuban\u2019s conduct toward game officials \u2013 along with his public criticism of NBA officiating, the officiating program, and individuals who work in the league\u2019s Referee Operations Department \u2013 violated NBA rules.  It is a recognized part of sports for fans and the media at times to criticize officiating, but team executives must be held to a higher standard. A team owner\u2019s effort to influence refereeing decisions during and after a game creates the perception of an unfair competitive advantage and thereby undermines the integrity of the game. Demeaning league employees also creates an intimidating workplace environment. With an increased focus on respectful conduct by coaches, players and fans during games, the actions of team executives should set an example and not lower expectations for appropriate behavior in our arenas. Unlike fans or the media, team executives are provided with several formal channels to voice their concerns with the league office about officiating. In fact, their input \u2013 including Mr. Cuban\u2019s \u2013 has helped the NBA enhance its officiating program through improved management, training, transparency, and technology. These enhancements include: Officiating is one of the toughest jobs in sports. While officials remain accountable for their on-court performance, maintaining competitive fairness and the integrity of the game is a fundamental obligation of the league office, team owners and personnel, and players."},{"id":28313,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-notebook-zone-defenses","date":"2020-03-06","title":"Friday's notebook: Zone defense usage is up, but teams have solutions","content":"A couple of years ago, a zone defense, unless it was being played by the Dallas Mavericks, looked completely bizarre in an NBA game. Today, it\u2019s rather common. According to Synergy play-type tracking, 18 of the 30 teams have played at least 100 possessions of zone through Thursday. That\u2019s up from 10 teams last season and just two in 2017-18. There have been about five possessions of zone defense per game this season. That may not seem like a lot, but it\u2019s more than six times as many as there were in \u201917-18 season and up from 3.1 possessions per game last season. According to Synergy, offenses have been more efficient against zone (0.99 points per possession) than against man-to-man (0.96). But some teams have been more successful with it than others. And a well-timed zone possession could be just what a defense needs to take the opponent out of its rhythm. Note: Synergy tracks possessions differently, in that an offensive rebound is the start of a new possession. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason teams don\u2019t run it all the time,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great way to shut people down. But what it is is a great way to expose a couple of weaknesses or change the tempo, change the pace of the game. It\u2019s becoming more and more relevant in the league these days. A lot of teams are utilizing it to good measure and with a lot of success.\u201d The Dallas Mavericks have been playing a healthy share of zone for several years now. When they won the championship nine years ago, the Mavs played almost 800 possessions of zone in the regular season. But the Miami Heat have led this new zone defense revolution. After playing less than 50 possessions of zone two seasons ago, the Heat played zone for more than 1,000 possessions last season. And this year, they\u2019ve played almost twice as much zone (764 possessions, according to Synergy) as any other team. That\u2019s 12.3 possessions of zone per game. And when the Mavs played the Heat last week, it was Miami that played 43 possessions of zone against the league\u2019s No. 1 offense. The Mavs were more efficient against the zone (53 points on those 43 possessions) than they were otherwise (65 points on 61), according to Synergy. The game turned when Dallas went scoreless on its first five possessions (all against zone) of the fourth quarter, but that was with both Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis off the floor, and the Mavs got some decent shots in that stretch. Following are the Mavs\u2019 first three possessions against zone in that game. They made 3-pointers on the first two, but the Heat made them work late into the shot clock on all three possessions and the first of those two threes came after Seth Curry got away with a travel. The players at the top of the zone are high and active, running shooters off the 3-point line. Playing zone against NBA offenses is no easier than playing man-to-man. The Toronto Raptors have played the second most possessions of zone this season. And they\u2019ve been slightly more successful with it (0.94 points allowed per possession, seventh in the league) than the Heat (0.97, 10th). Raptors coach Nick Nurse was asked about the personnel needed to be successful playing zone at a high volume. \u201cThey\u2019re smart,\u201d he said of his players. \u201cThey make the reads. It takes some intelligence and it takes a little bit more hustle sometimes, because you\u2019re running around in different areas than you\u2019re used to. I think those two things, for any defense that you play, if you play smart and you hustle, you\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d Interestingly, Nurse\u2019s Raptors are the team against whom zone defenses have been most effective. According to Synergy, the champs have scored just 0.76 points per possession against zone, compared to 0.97 against man-to-man. The most common usage of a zone defense is in the first possession after a timeout. In those situations, the coach of the offense has often drawn up a play to get an open shot. And by playing a zone instead of man-to-man, the defense throws a wrench in those plans. \u201cIt\u2019s to take away the drawn-up play,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cSometimes, you have some really good ones after timeouts, and you can\u2019t use them if they go to the zone. It\u2019s a different look.\u201d But how does the offense react when the defense tries to ruin its plans? Over the last several weeks, the same question was posed to some coaches and players: \u201cIf you come out of a timeout and the opposing defense is in zone, do you run the play that you drew up, or do you audible into a zone set?\u201d Here are their answers\u2026 Kenny Atkinson, Nets head coach: \u201cIf that team has been playing zone consistently and it seems like they\u2019re sticking with it, you have a zone timeout [play]. If it\u2019s a team that that does it sporadically and they do it to take away your timeout, you\u2019d like to have one that works against man and zone. \u201cThe hard thing to convince NBA players is that, even if they are in a zone, still run the play that we called . They want to, all of a sudden, put in some new offensive system in 30 seconds.\u201d Brett Brown, Sixers head coach: \u201c I want to run, by and large, the same thing . There\u2019s a wink and a blink and you change it. We talk about it all the time. It\u2019s \u2018Run the play, and this is what you\u2019re going to be looking at if they\u2019re in a zone.\u2019 Because you can really scout and know if teams do that more than they don\u2019t. You can scout and know if they do do that, they\u2019re more apt to be in a 3-2 (Toronto) or (Golden State) 2-3. There\u2019s a difference in what you feel your point of attack is. \u201cBut, by and large, you go into it saying that I\u2019m going to run the same thing, but this is what will be available if you find that they\u2019re in a zone that they commonly are in. Rarely do people come out and change the look of their zone. They\u2019ll either be in a 3-2 or a 2-3.\u201d Taylor Jenkins, Grizzlies head coach: \u201cObviously, when it\u2019s thrown out as a surprise, I try to get the guys to just execute the play . It could be a successful possession or it may not. But if we see zone over a period of possessions, we definitely have two or three things that we go to, maybe some different screening angles. We try to use our half-court sets to really create what we want, which is drive-and-kick. \u201cObviously, zone can throw off some of your driving lanes. But for us, we kind of fall back on what we do and just emphasize something a little more, in terms of getting in and getting to the second side.\u201d Steve Kerr, Warriors head coach: \u201c We usually just run the same play . I think the most effective tactic that the zone really represents is just a change of look. If you come down and you\u2019ve got a play in mind, and you think if they\u2019re in zone, we better go to our zone offense, by that time, the 24 second clock is going. And that\u2019s all the time it takes to really ruin your possession to get everybody reorganized. \u201cSo we just say, \u2018Just play.\u2019 And for the most part, if you play against a zone, you can find an open shot.\u201d Nick Nurse, Raptors head coach: \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff you can run against both. And sometimes, you have a play for each called. We\u2019ll audible.\u201d Frank Vogel, Lakers head coach: \u201c We typically audible to our zone set , our zone alignment, once we see that, and just play through that \u2026 There is value in just running the action and finding space.\u201d Anthony Tolliver, Grizzlies forward: \u201cMost coaches that I\u2019ve played for just say, \u2018Run the play.\u2019 Keep it simple. Run the play, even though it\u2019s not necessarily going to have the same effect if it was man-to-man. It still, most likely, will get us into position to get the ball moving and possibly get an open shot. \u201cYou still have to be a basketball player and read the situation, read what\u2019s going on, read how it plays out. If you\u2019re supposed to cut and there\u2019s three people there, maybe you stay spaced. Or if you\u2019re not supposed to cut and there\u2019s nobody there, maybe you cut.\u201d CJ McCollum, Blazers guard: \u201cNo. We have certain actions that we run based on the defense, and we would run a certain action. We wouldn\u2019t run the play , though. If we see zone, there\u2019s something that we run.\u201d McCollum\u2019s Blazers have seen the fewest possessions of zone (47) in the league. But here are a few where you can see the \u201csomething\u201d that they run, a \u201cwheel\u201d action to put pressure on the defenders on the left side of the floor\u2026 The Pacers got a wide-open corner three from Doug McDermott against the Spurs\u2019 zone on Monday with a similar overload of the left side of the floor. Domantas Sabonis first set a pin-down screen for Aaron Holiday, and after DeMar DeRozan (the left baseline defender in the Spurs zone) recovered out to Holiday, Sabonis set another screen on Drew Eubanks (the middle baseline defender) as McDermott scooted out to the corner\u2026 The best place to get the ball against a zone is the middle of the floor. Brooklyn played just five possessions of zone against Miami last week, probably because the Heat got into the teeth of the defense so easily\u2026 The most effective team against the zone this season has been the Denver Nuggets, who have scored 1.23 points per possession against zone, compared to 0.97 against man-to-man, according to Synergy. When you have a brilliant passer who\u2019s 7-feet tall, putting him in the middle of the zone seems like a good formula for success. Here are a few Nikola Jokic dimes against zone defenses\u2026 Five of the six teams who have played the most zone possessions \u2013 Miami, Toronto, Brooklyn, Dallas and the Clippers \u2013 will (likely) be in the playoffs. We may not see it for three quarters of a game (like when the Heat played the Raptors in early January), but every possession counts in the postseason and a few possessions of zone could affect the result of a game or two. It\u2019s absolutely something that coaches and players have to be ready for. \u201cWhen I first came into the league, that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cNone of that stuff entered into your mind. But it makes the league more interesting. The tactics more interesting. I think we\u2019re going to see more of it.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Training camp begins in October and teams point their noses toward The Finals in June and hopefully those players are on the lucky team of 30 that walks off champagne-soaked with hardware tucked under their arms. If not? Lather, rinse, repeat. It\u2019s a grind that doesn\u2019t allow for too many celebrations along the way. The odds always are the same and the closer a team gets to a title, the more single-minded it must become. The games, the countless hours it spends at practice, on planes and in hotels all necessarily narrow down to one single goal:  Championship or bust. The Milwaukee Bucks have faced that more in 2019-20 than any other team, given events from last season hang over this one \u2014 as well as where they are in their life cycle and roster composition. The Bucks were the NBA\u2019s winningest team last season, reaching the Eastern Conference finals and building a 2-0 series lead on Toronto there before losing four straight to the Raptors. Their abrupt exit effectively drew a red circle around the East finals this year, a target waaaaaay down the road from training camp, the season opener, All-Star weekend or even now. There was no avoiding it, and yet it\u2019s a grim, inflexible way to slog through nearly eight months of work. Which prompts the question: What about now? The Bucks have had a season \u2014 so far \u2014 not just to remember but to celebrate and savor. They won 18 straight games from early November to mid-December. They are 50-8 with an historic average-margin-of-victory. They made playoff-clinching history last week and are enjoying a second season in their gorgeous, new arena (to go with their breathtaking practice headquarters across the street in downtown Milwaukee). Wait, there\u2019s more: Another stellar, better-than-last-year performance from defending Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Marvelous contributions from fellow All-Star Khris Middleton and holdovers such as Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe. New additions Wesley Matthews, Robin Lopez and Kyle Korver are fitting in well and second-year guard Donte DiVincenzo is improving. All with reigning Coach of the Year Mike Budenholzer\u2019s steady hand on the wheel, his staff pushing most of the right buttons throughout. So that\u2019s all going to get wiped away and forgotten if the Bucks don\u2019t reach The Finals? Man, that\u2019s cold. In this era of participation trophies, when we\u2019re told by deep thinkers and TV commercials to find highlights in everyday life, the winner-take-all construct of pro sports seems punishing, unforgiving and, frankly, kind of silly. Consider: The 2007 New England Patriots went 16-0, rolled over two playoff foes and then had it wiped away in many folks\u2019 minds when they lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants. The Buffalo Bills teams that went to four Super Bowls? Bah, trash, \u2018cuz they never won. \u201cCelebrating? Maybe because there\u2019s a bigger picture, a bigger prize, we don\u2019t tend to celebrate,\u201d Budenholzer said this week. \u201cOr do anything where we feel like we\u2019ve really accomplished anything that needs celebrating. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re a group that comes to work and enjoys each other and enjoys the process. It\u2019s not just 24\/7 of just boring and nothing.\u201d The experts don\u2019t provide much help in dealing with this tug o\u2019 war between the present and the (desired) future. For every philosopher that tells us it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination, there\u2019s a self-help guru harping on the need to begin with the end in mind. Then you get the stray poet nagging about a path not taken, and you\u2019re in no mood to enjoy anything. Fortunately for the Bucks\u2019 sanity, and their right to savor a bit what they\u2019ve earned so far, their group personality \u2014 that so-called chemistry to which good teams aspire \u2014 has allowed them to enjoy their work even as they push forward. \u201cI think we do a good job of that,\u201d Brook Lopez said. \u201cWe\u2019re all focused, but we\u2019re loose, having fun at the same time. It\u2019s just kind of natural \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the group of people we have. Maybe our leadership, from the coaching staff and Giannis, all the way down. We just have a good vibe.\u201d There are team dinners or large groups of players hitting up attractions on the road. The Bucks\u2019 sideline in blowout wins frequently offer a glimpse of the fun factor, too. \u201cI think everyone knows what our overall goal is,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cand even though we might be disappointed in the moment with a loss, we know what we\u2019re trying to achieve. It\u2019s hard to put into words. But it\u2019s just the right feeling.\u201d The best, of course, would be to have and do it all: Tear through the regular season as they have, celebrate the team and individual highlights, while prepping for what\u2019s to come. And then nailing that too. That\u2019s precisely how Milwaukee\u2019s best player, emotional leader and unofficial philosopher is playing it. Whether it\u2019s a ballyhooed \u201cFinals preview\u201d against the Los Angeles Lakers Friday (10:30 ET, ESPN), the work he and his teammates logged when they practiced after a dreary loss in Miami or an individual season that has him as the MVP favorite again . \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m thinking about how I can get better every day,\u201d Antetokounmpo told NBA.com Wednesday. \u201cObviously life is short and you\u2019ve got to enjoy the journey. If you really think about it, the goal does not matter as much because even if you, say, win the championship, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about the whole journey.\u201d That isn\u2019t how national media likely will portray it if the Bucks don\u2019t reach The Finals and earn their rings. They want to do that, of course. But should their entire season be defined by it? Maybe we all should listen to Antetokounmpo. \u201cI feel like the journey finds who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cLike when you get to The Finals \u2014 this is a good example \u2014 and if you win the championship, are you going to stop working hard? You get a job you wanted, are you going to stop working hard? \u201cIt\u2019s about the journey. It\u2019s always about the journey. How can you have fun? How can you enjoy it? Even if we\u2019re winning the championship at the end of the day, we\u2019re not going to remember just the championship. We\u2019re going to remember what we did to get there.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

We\u2019re going to find out in the aftermath of Friday\u2019s 113-103 victory by the Los Angeles Lakers over the Milwaukee Bucks square in their second and final matchup this regular season. LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 by most accounts, the two leading candidates in the Kia MVP chase \u2014 shared the court for just the third time this season. The Bucks beat the Lakers 111-104 at Fiserv Forum on Dec. 19 and Team LeBron beat Team Giannis in the 2020 All-Star Game last month in Chicago . A one-game sample doesn\u2019t necessarily provide the sort of context needed to completely evaluate the MVP worthiness of either player. But in a narrative-driven race that is steaming toward its mid-April voting deadline, the takeaways from this matchup will certainly sway some undecided voters. That James, 35, and Antetokounmpo, 25, are rivals is a testament to their careers. That age gap is significant for a pair of generational talents who represent two distinct factions of NBA eras. Antetokounmpo joins Dirk Nowitzki and Yao Ming as one of the faces of the global influence on the NBA game. James joins Kevin Garnett and the late Kobe Bryant on the Mount Rushmore of the movement of American teenagers who bypassed college for the NBA. T hat age gap might also explain the reverence Giannis has for LeBron, who was already a global superstar when \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d fantasies about being on this stage were still just a teenager\u2019s pipe-dream. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s 35 and playing at a high level,\u201d Antetokounmpo told reporters Wednesday . \u201cHe just leads the path for us. A lot of times we think that, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to retire at 35,\u2019 but seeing a guy at 35 being still top-three best player in the world, that makes us want to be there. \u2026 He paved the way, and hopefully we can just follow.\u201d Following in LeBron\u2019s footsteps as a multiple-time Kia MVP is a part of what Giannis has on the line with his historic encore MVP season with the Bucks. His breakthrough last season provided a storybook plot twist in a career that began in an obscure Greek league for a Nigerian immigrant who no one had ticketed for NBA stardom. If we could only get the main stars to play their part in the drama. LeBron told reporters Thursday that MVP trophies aren\u2019t now and never have been his motivation. He always had bigger goals in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s never motivated me,\u201d James told reporters. \u201cRegular-season MVP has never motivated me. To be the best \u2014 to be the best to ever play the game has motivated me and has resulted in me being able to be league MVP a couple times. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never gone into the season saying, \u2018OK, league MVP is what I want to be.\u2019 I\u2019ve gone into the season saying, \u2018OK, I want to be the MVP of this team; I want to be the best player in the world,\u2019 and how I approach my game every day, how I take care of my body every day has resulted in that [award].\u201d Either way, this could be the final glimpse we get of these two contenders this season. There\u2019s no guarantee either one of them battles through their respective playoff fields and survives for what could be an epic Finals matchup in June, a big-stage engagement that could settle this season\u2019s \u201cMVP debate\u201d once and for all. * * * The Top 5 this week in the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  29.6 points, 13.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals, 1.0 blocks Miami put the squeeze on him Monday night as well as anyone has all season, but it\u2019s not a blueprint other teams will be able to follow. Antetokounmpo bounced back with a trademark effort (29 points, 12 rebounds and six assists) in Wednesday\u2019s win over Indiana. He should be rested and ready to go for tonight\u2019s showdown against the Lakers (he lit them up for 34, 11 and seven in the previous matchup). Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  25.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, 1.2 steals LeBron and Anthony Davis were at their superstar best in Tuesday\u2019s win over an overmatched Philadelphia team. LeBron finished with 22 points, 14 assists, seven rebounds, two blocks and a steal. He\u2019ll need to produce in similar fashion over the course of the next 48 hours with Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in town Friday and a Sunday afternoon showdown with Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers up next. Last week: No. 5 Season stats:  28.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.0 steals Doncic didn\u2019t let a thumb sprain keep him from delivering down the stretch in an overtime win over rookie sensation Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans. Doncic\u2019s 30 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists was the perfect performance to pair with a wicked dose of Kristaps Porzingis (34 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks). The Mavericks\u2019 dynamic duo seems to be grooving as the playoffs draw near. Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  26.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.8 steals The Clippers have won six straight games by an average of 17 points, which sets up a spectacular Sunday showdown between Staples Center tenants who are No. 1 and 2, respectively, in the West standings. Leonard will silence a lot of the critics of his injury management protocol with another dominant outing against James, Anthony Davis and the Lakers. Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  34.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.7 steals The Rockets\u2019 small-ball revolution hit a snag with back-to-back losses to the lowly Knicks and the streaking Clippers. Harden hit the Knicks up for 35 points, but shot poorly. His game flat-lined against the Clippers\u2019 stingy perimeter defensive brigade as things got out of hand early Thursday night.

On Friday, he\u2019ll see Giannis Antetokounmpo ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ), who stands between him and a fifth MVP award, and Sunday brings Kawhi Leonard ( 3:30 ET, ABC ), more qualified than anyone to deny LeBron a fourth championship. These two regular-season games against the Bucks and Clippers won\u2019t determine much, if anything, right away. They will, however, tell us and LeBron what lies ahead and identify his two biggest takeover threats to the throne here in his final stage as a superstar. Whether his decision to join the Lakers two summers ago brings a Hollywood ending or an ordinary sunset could be determined by a freak from another country who seems poised to rule the league, and a quiet force who coldly tunes out everything except winning titles. Almost by design if not by accident, Giannis and Kawhi are conspiring to toss a vicious double-team in LeBron\u2019s direction and while LeBron has seen every manner of defense and conquered most of them, you wonder if even he can handle this. What exactly is at stake here? Well, let\u2019s suppose LeBron, at 35, collects more MVP votes than Giannis and then posterizes Kawhi on the way to a title. If so, then that GOAT needle will most certainly start to quiver and sway away from Michael Jordan in the minds of some, and really, there\u2019s nothing else left for LeBron to accomplish other than winning that argument. At a time when most other stars at this point in their careers are playing with house money \u2014 and that\u2019s even if they\u2019re still active \u2014 LeBron is still bringing a sense of purpose and a thirsty quest to take care of business he believes is unfinished. He may be just shy of having a performance for the ages but it\u2019s definitely one for the aged. His outside shooting ( from the mid-court logo ) and also his ability to find teammates with well-timed passes has never been sharper, and his impact on the Western Conference-leading Lakers is undeniable. And of course, what makes this all the more impressive is LeBron is feeling and looking this frisky in his 17th season and after 1,400-plus games (including playoffs) of tread wear by averaging 25 points, seven rebounds and leading the league with just under 11 assists per night. Among those giving LeBron his due respect is Giannis, who called him \u201can alien\u201d and added: \u201cHe\u2019s 35 and playing at a high level. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d The brilliance of LeBron lies with a mixture of talent and wisdom and a body that has rebounded nicely from last year\u2019s hiccup that saw him fall victim to a groin strain. He does not need any \u201cload management\u201d time off or suffer from performance slumps. As a result, the Lakers have led the West almost since opening night and while having Anthony Davis does help, this is mainly a LeBron production, him elevating teammates and raising hopes for a Lakers renaissance. The man is still evolving and refusing to coast on what brought him to this point. \u201cFor me, personally, I just want to continue to have a growth mindset, however the game is changing, being able to change my game and also be true to who I am at the same time, just not trying to have any weaknesses,\u201d he said. And yet, grabbing the 2019-20 brass ring is hardly guaranteed. He might actually find it heavily greased. Giannis is ripping through a season that is on pace to top his MVP performance of last year. In roughly 31 minutes a night, he\u2019s averaging just under 30 points and 14 rebounds while rating high in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Unlike LeBron, he\u2019s working without an A-list partner, and most important, he has the Bucks, strutting with a league-best 53-9 record, sneering down on 29 other teams at the moment. He\u2019s currently the best one-man show in basketball right now and because his shooting skills remain a work in progress at least from a consistency standpoint, he still has room to grow. His leadership and competitive edge are part of the irresistible package, and Giannis clearly relishes the chance to be great \u2014 he publicly stated a desire to win back-to-back MVPs even before the season began. He knows he must measure himself against the best and in that sense, Giannis has mostly delivered. In the season\u2019s lone meeting with the Lakers back in December, he was good for 34 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists against a Lakers team that threw Davis, LeBron and Dwight Howard in his path. That\u2019s three players with first-team All-Defensive team honors in their past. He also dropped a career-best five 3-pointers when the Lakers disrespected him and gave him space. But that was just a sample of Giannis\u2019 Greatest Hits against the league elite. His points and rebounds rampage left others in shambles, too. Against the Sixers, 36 and 20; Nuggets, 31 and 20; Celtics, 32 and 17; Clippers, 38 and 16; Raptors, 36 and 15. And the Bucks are issuing almost nightly blowouts and lead the NBA by far in point differential. These are the credentials Giannis will offer up to MVP voters who are likely to see this as a two-man race. Kawhi brings another type of challenge to LeBron. He\u2019s strictly programmed to win a title, nothing more. If, for example, Kawhi was hell-bent on being in the MVP conversation, he wouldn\u2019t have skipped back-to-back games early in the season. And maybe he wouldn\u2019t have insisted on the Clippers trading for Paul George as a condition on Kawhi signing as a free agent last summer. And he certainly would be more forthcoming in media circles if only to generate buzz. But Kawhi is, as they say, different. He. Does. Not. Care. About. That. His laser is aimed at May and June. The managing of his body and mind was carefully preserved all season with those dates in mind. His concentration is distraction-proof, which makes him the most serious danger to LeBron\u2019s chances of winning another title. How many stars, if given a chance, would\u2019ve passed on a chance to become teammates with LeBron and Davis, as Kawhi did last summer? Again, Kawhi is different. Rather than join LeBron, he chose to beat LeBron. Rather than become just another star in the Lakers\u2019 Walk of Fame, he chose the more arduous and less glamorous task of tug-boating the Clippers. This speaks about the man\u2019s competitive streak and basketball soul. He took the harder way. And so far, so good. Kawhi is 2-0 vs. LeBron this season, winning one of those games without George. His performance this season seems very understated, and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Kawhi is good with the fuss being generated by Giannis, LeBron, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, his former team in Toronto and lately Jayson Tatum. Meanwhile, Kawhi is averaging 27 points, tweaking the analytics geeks by perfecting the mid-range game, leading the Clippers in rebounds and second in assists and watching his body become stronger and fitter as the calendar flips. There\u2019s an argument that the Clippers would be leading the West if not for all the missed games by Kawhi and George, and how the Clips, who also recently added rotational players Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson, are pacing for springtime and making sure they\u2019re cohesive and healthy by then. That\u2019s a page ripped straight from the Book of Kawhi. He knows what we know but won\u2019t admit: Nobody cares who won from October through April. The only month worth winning is June. Don\u2019t hate the player (Kawhi) for that, hate the game. LeBron is programmed, even at this age, to win in June as well. The evidence strongly says he\u2019s at least giving himself a chance to collect the MVP and championship trophies; it wouldn\u2019t be a shock if he goes two-for-two, or at least adds one of them. Giannis and Kawhi will have a strong say about those trophies which will be announced and decided in June. Meanwhile, in the next 48 hours, thanks to genius schedule-making, LeBron James will get an advanced look at those two All-Star mountains blocking him. Let\u2019s call this a sneak peak what lies ahead. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

The small-ball revolution in Houston was nationally televised Thursday night on TNT, with the home team absorbing its largest home loss of the season in part because its go-to 3-point shooting wilted under the length and strength of a deep Clippers roster that knew it needed to play big to prosper. \u201cListen, what they do is smart for what they do,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t get caught in trying to play that way, and I thought we didn\u2019t. Going into the game we were telling them, \u2018You have to play big tonight. You can\u2019t be small.\u2019\u201d That philosophy coupled with stellar depth paid dividends in helping the Clippers capture their 6th consecutive victory in a contest pitting a pair of Western Conference title contenders. On the other side, the lopsided loss taken by the Rockets did little to deter their resolve to continue playing small. Houston shot just 7 of 42 from 3-point range after averaging 18 made 3-pointers in the previous 13 games, when the Rockets elected to play small exclusively. The 16.7% 3-point performance registered as the fourth-lowest in NBA history by a team with at least 40 attempts. It also marked just the second time this season Houston knocked down fewer than 10 attempts from deep. Those misses fueled a Clippers feast in transition. \u201cThey got back,\u201d said Russell Westbrook, who scored a game-high 29 points on 11-of-27 shooting after averaging 33.6 points on 56.3% shooting in his previous eight outings. \u201cThat was part of the game plan. They got back. Some of their strength is on the glass. I think they decided it wasn\u2019t more important than us getting out in transition, and they got back for the most part.\u201d Through the first 3 quarters, LA owned a 20-8 advantage in fast-break points. \u201cThat was big for us,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cOne of the things going into the game, we thought with our size if we could rebound, we had to run. We told our bigs. That\u2019s why [Ivica Zubac] and [Montrezl Harrell], we kept bringing them out because we told them that if they just run straight down the middle of the floor, they would create a matchup. And they kept doing that. You\u2019ve got to get the rebound first. Then once we got it, we really pushed the break. I thought that was huge for us.\u201d Houston\u2019s shooting woes proved to be bigger. The Rockets opened the contest hitting 2 of 12 from 3-point range. Trailing by seven points with 1:30 left in the opening quarter, Jeff Green drained a 24-footer to make it 27-23. Houston wouldn\u2019t hit another shot from deep until 1:57 remained in the third quarter. The Rockets missed 20 consecutive 3-pointers and trailed by as many as 30 points throughout the night. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t do what we were supposed to do on both ends of the floor,\u201d said James Harden, who finished with 16 points and was 0-for-8 on 3-pointers. \u201cThey made some tough shots, but they\u2019re a good team. Offensively, we just didn\u2019t have any rhythm. They made us play in the half court because we didn\u2019t get any stops. So, chalk it up as a learning lesson, and we just have to bounce back.\u201d The Clippers are 10-0 this season when they come into a injury-free and are 23-7 when both Kawhi Leonard (25 points on Thursday) and Paul George (13 points) are in the lineup. The Clippers reserves, meanwhile, outscored Houston\u2019s 49-40, marking the 15th straight game L.A.\u2019s reserves have outscored opposing benches. That depth stood out early as Rivers utilized 10 different players in the 1st quarter alone. George pointed to the team\u2019s overall competitiveness in explaining Thursday\u2019s outcome. \u201cThis team is so versatile, so competitive,\u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing you can take away [from this game] is how competitive we are.\u201d The world will see it on display again Sunday as another national TV game \u2014 this time against the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 looms ( 3:30 ET, ABC ). As for Houston, it\u2019s too late now to turn its back on playing small as the season series with the Clippers finished tied 2-2. \u201cNow, we know where we\u2019ve got to go, and we\u2019ll respond,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt won\u2019t break us, but this will make us. I\u2019ll have to look at the tape a little bit, and then figure [it] out. But most of the stuff, that\u2019s what we do. Most of the times it\u2019s good. Tonight, was really bad. It\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s not going to end today. We\u2019ll be back and guys will regather. We\u2019ve got a great group. I\u2019ve got to find out a little bit about the rotations and stuff. I\u2019ve got to figure a few things out, and we will.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The Warriors announced Wednesday night that Curry had been medically cleared to play and would be in the lineup Thursday in a rematch of last year\u2019s NBA Finals won in six games by Toronto. The two-time NBA MVP missed 58 games after falling on his left hand Oct. 30 versus Phoenix. He practiced Monday with the G League Santa Cruz Warriors, then was recalled back to the NBA team later in the day in a most expected promotion . Curry got up shots on Thursday morning before the game and afterward, spoke with the media. During that conversation, he was asked about participating in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. He was among the 44 players announced as finalists for the team that will play this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of time before now and then, but I\u2019ve always had that on my radar for sure,\u201d Curry said Thursday, per Anthony Slater of The Athletic . As to whether or not the injury made him question participating in the Olympics, Curry said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a thought until recently when I knew where I was ready to play. Right now the focus, obviously, is just trying to stay healthy these last 20 games. Get my rhythm back, get to the level of basketball I know I\u2019m capable of playing. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to be done April 16 [when the NBA regular season ends], so you kind of understand what the schedule looks like leading up to July when training camp in Las Vegas starts.

Curry, who turns 32 on March 14, had hoped to return last Sunday against Washington but his timeline wasn\u2019t too far delayed. He is averaging 20.3 points, 6.5 assists and 5.0 rebounds over just four games this season.

He\u2019s a game-changer.\u201d Wiggins is scoring 20.1 points in his first nine games with the Warriors.

And both Ja Morant and Zion Williamson stepped up for The King. With the Grizzlies mired in a five-game losing streak, Morant had one of his best all-around games of his young career, scoring 27 points while handing out a career high-tying 14 assists in a 105-88 win over the Lakers. Morant was 10-for-16 from the field, hitting 4 of 6 3-pointers and even dedicated the win to a Twitter troll afterward . \u201cThe kid is super special,\u201d said James , whose Lakers had won the three previous meetings. \u201cLike I said when we just played him in L.A., Memphis got a great one. They got a great one. So, the sky\u2019s the limit for the kid.\u201d The four 3s were a career high for Morant, and it was the second straight 20-point, 10-assist game, a feat done only by Luka Doncic and Trae Young since 2011-12. While Morant picked up the win in his meeting to help solidify the Grizzlies as the 8th seed in the West (currently 3.5 games up on Portland), Williamson\u2019s Pelicans weren\u2019t able to come out on top in their matchup in L.A. But Williamson sure did his part in his first meeting with LeBron James. The No. 1 pick scored a career-high 35 points on 12-for-16 shooting, but also had six turnovers and got his own front-row seat to a vintage LeBron performance. LeBron finished with 34 points, 12 rebounds and 13 assists, but still heaped praise on Zion for his big game. \u201cYou have to actually be out on the floor to actually feel the strength and the speed that he plays at,\u201d James said . \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a rookie class, I\u2019ll tell you that. These kids are special.\u201d And while LeBron was once in the position of Zion and Ja, fighting to earn respect, he\u2019s ready to be the helpful elder statesman. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought about that,\u201d James said. \u201cLike, what young guys are coming up in the ranks that will be able to continue to carry it on after I\u2019m gone. You look at Ja and you look at Zion. You look at Jayson Tatum. You look at Luka Doncic and Trae Young, and the list goes on and on. Those guys are just not only great on the floor but also, more importantly, off the floor. And that\u2019s a great thing to have. \u2026 Our league is in a very, very good place. * * * Last week: No. 1 In a manner of days, things can change quickly in the NBA \u2026 and Morant and the Grizzlies are the embodiment of that notion. Memphis was seemingly in jeopardy of losing its grip on the No. 8 seed thanks to a five-game post-All-Star break swoon. During that skid, Morant had cooled considerably as his stats dropped to 16.8 ppg, 5.2 apg and a frigid 15.4% on 3-pointers. But both he and the Grizzlies have righted the ship since then and are 3-1 after Wednesday\u2019s win against Brooklyn. Morant was key in one of the Grizzlies\u2019 biggest wins of the season during that stretch, a blowout of the Lakers on Feb. 29 , and is averaging 18.3 ppg and 8.8 apg while shooting an impressive 46.2% on 3-pointers over his last four games. Last week: No. 2 What a week it was for the No. 1 overall pick, as he had a chance to show his stuff against Kia MVP contenders LeBron James ( on March 1 ) and Luka Doncic ( March 4 ). Williamson didn\u2019t shrink in the spotlight either time, notching a career-high 35 points (and seven rebounds) in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Lakers that added another thrilling chapter to a burgeoning rivalry. As for the meeting with Doncic, the Mavs\u2019 star dazzled with a triple-double, but Zion wasn\u2019t exactly a non-factor as he had 21 points, six rebounds and three assists himself. To Williamson, these kinds of star showdowns are learning experiences. \u201cThe NBA, these are the best players in the world,\u201d he said after the game against Dallas. \u201cThey\u2019re smart. They have high IQs for the game. They have scouting reports, so I think it\u2019s just bringing something new to the table every game.\u201d Last week: No. 4  Since the All-Star break, White has been on a tear and currently ranks as the No. 2 rookie scorer during that span (25.7 ppg), trailing only Williamson (26.7 ppg). While his 30-point scoring streak (which we detailed last week ) is done, he\u2019s definitely shooting better overall of late (44.1% in his last three games) than he has all season (39.2% overall). He was one of February\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Month winners and is no doubt endearing himself to Bulls fans with his hustle (his 59 loose balls recovered ranks him among some of the league\u2019s best).   Last week: No. 3 Nunn quietly continues to make history for Miami. Earlier this season, he became the first undrafted rookie in NBA history to win the Kia Rookie of the Month award multiple times. He added to his lore in a Feb. 29 win against the Nets, passing Mario Chalmers\u2019 team record for 3-pointers in a season (114) as he\u2019s up to 121 made 3-pointers after Wednesday\u2019s win against the Magic. There\u2019s potentially more history afoot for Nunn as he needs six more 20-point games to pass the rookie team record for 20-point games set by Caron Butler in 2002-03. It\u2019s all part of a post-All-Star break run that has Nunn ranked third among rookies in scoring (17.8 ppg) and heating up from 3-point range (44.9%). Last week: Not ranked If you missed it, the Knicks have been in the headlines the last few days (and not always for wins and losses). Off-the-court drama may be in the mix lately, but so, too, has Barrett. He\u2019s averaging 20 ppg and shooting 57.5% (and 50%) on 3-pointers over his last three games, which includes a solid showing against James Harden and the Rockets on March 2 . The rookie more than held his own against the former Kia MVP winner, finishing with 27 points (on 10-for-18 shooting) and had a key driving layup with 7.6 seconds left that helped ice the win.

Steph is back! For a myriad of reasons, Warriors fans likely won\u2019t be in a big hurry to relive the 2019-20 season. Still, tonight will stand out as one of the moments they likely will reflect on as Stephen Curry is back after a 58-game absence to face to Toronto Raptors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). The Warriors\u2019 pathway for the season seems more or less set , but the return of Curry and his dazzling shooting and dribbling skills provide some new intrigue to a Golden State season that has lacked that. As for Toronto, it can wrap up a playoff berth with a win tonight. Additionally, the Raptors are just 1 game ahead of the Boston Celtics for the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 2 seed. 2. Another George vs. Westbrook showdown Juicy matchups of superstars have been the norm this week in the NBA and it shows no sign of letting up. The Clippers host the Rockets ( 8 ET, TNT ) in another such showdown that will have LA\u2019s Paul George and Kawhi Leonard taking on Houston\u2019s Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Add in that Houston is 2 1\/2 games behind the Clippers for No. 2 in the West (and 1-2 so far vs. LA this season) and there\u2019s another level of intrigue to take note of. There\u2019s a good chance these teams could square off come playoff time , so don\u2019t miss out on this one tonight. 3. Can Kings keep on rolling? The Pelicans, Blazers and Spurs are starting to falter in the chase for No. 8 in the West. The Grizzlies have gotten a better hold of that spot of late, but don\u2019t sleep on the Kings making a serious push down the stretch. Sacramento is 6-1 since the All-Star break and has a soft schedule, too (48.3% opponent win percentage) that could help its cause. A home date with the Sixers is up next ( 10 ET, League Pass ) another Kings win would pull them ahead of Portland for the No. 9 spot."},{"id":28359,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-miami-duncan-robinson-record-3-point-land","date":"2020-03-05","title":"Miami's Duncan Robinson on a record path from 3-point land","content":" MIAMI \u2014 Duncan Robinson is about to collect a whole slew of records. Most 3-pointers by any player in either of his first two NBA seasons. Most 3-pointers by a Miami Heat player in a season. And he\u2019s already tied the league record for most 3-pointers by an undrafted player in a season. He\u2019s not just going to break them. He might smash them. There are 20 games left in the season, and Robinson is up to 225 3-pointers \u2014 the most recent nine coming in Miami\u2019s 116-113 win over Orlando on Wednesday night, a game in which he made seven in a row to end the first half. \u201cIf you took a poll on NBA players and asked who Duncan Robinson was coming into training camp, I would say probably 70% of the league didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Robinson wasn\u2019t offended. If anything, he thinks his coach is low-balling that 70% estimate. \u201cI would probably say more than that,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cBut no, no, that doesn\u2019t bother me. You\u2019ve got to expect that. The path that I\u2019ve taken is a little unconventional, but hopefully at this point I\u2019ve garnered some respect in that regard.\u201d The Heat record, perhaps just until Friday when Miami plays at New Orleans, belongs to Wayne Ellington; he made 227 in the 2017-18 season. Kyle Korver has the mark for a player in his second NBA season; he made 226 in the 2004-05 campaign. And the undrafted-player record had been held by Damon Jones, who made 225 for Miami in 2004-05. It also bears noting that Robinson was unaware of the Heat record; he asked Wednesday night after the game what it was. So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been chasing the mark. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d Heat All-Star center Bam Adebayo said of Robinson\u2019s success. \u201cWhen you see a guy do that over and over and over and his preparation and practice and when he\u2019s in there by himself with the coaches, it doesn\u2019t shock you.\u201d Robinson is two behind Ellington, one behind Korver and is tied with Jones. At his current pace, and if he plays in all of Miami\u2019s 20 remaining games, he would finish with 298 3-pointers \u2014 a total that, in NBA history, only Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry (three times) and Houston\u2019s James Harden (once) have reached. But in this 3-point-mad NBA, a league that is on pace to smash the single-season 3-point record for an eighth consecutive year, shooters are the lifeblood. And the Heat came into this season touting Robinson \u2014 who got most of his minutes last year in the G League \u2014 as one of the best shooters on the planet. They weren\u2019t kidding. \u201cSome of it is the times,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI just went an entire game and I didn\u2019t take a 2. That was unheard of years ago. There\u2019s some inflation there, for sure. But that\u2019s not to deflect credit. I\u2019ve had a good shooting season. But it\u2019s the times. And I am aware that I might not have existed as an NBA player in 2005 or 2010, even. It\u2019s all pretty humbling.\u201d Robinson\u2019s path is remarkable: No Division I scholarship offers out of high school led him toward playing his freshman season at Division III Williams College in Massachusetts, before Michigan brought him aboard for his final three collegiate seasons. He\u2019s the only player to appear in the Division I and Division III national championship games. He went undrafted in 2018, signed a summer-league deal with the Heat and made 17 of his first 27 3-pointers. That was all Miami needed to see, and he\u2019s been with the Heat ever since. He appeared in only 15 NBA games last season (making only 10 3\u2019s), and now he\u2019s a starter on a team on pace to win 53 games this season. Plus, he might even be a legitimate candidate for Most Improved Player. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a remarkable story of persistence and how much he\u2019s improved,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d"},{"id":28349,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-celtics-cavaliers-hit-injuries","date":"2020-03-05","title":"Celtics, Cavaliers hit by injuries","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers were missing several key players Wednesday night because of injuries.

The process of protesting the outcome of an NBA game based on an incorrect ruling or misapplication of the rules does offer a final court of appeal for an especially aggrieved team. Not a cheap one, mind you, nor anything that guarantees satisfaction. But it\u2019s there, and every so often teams avail themselves of the process. The Dallas Mavericks are the latest, awaiting a ruling on the protest they filed after their 111-107 road loss to the Hawks on Feb. 22. The Mavericks took issue with an incorrect goaltending call on Dorian Finney-Smith, who blocked Atlanta guard Trae Young\u2019s drive to the basket. A referee\u2019s whistle blew, the ball caromed to the Hawks\u2019 John Collins, who immediately scored. When the play was reviewed, the goaltending call was reversed \u2014 yet Collins\u2019 put-back was counted. After the whistle. What Dallas wanted was a jump ball with 9.7 seconds left and the score still at 109-107. What it got was a four-point gap and too little time to close it, followed by crew chief Rodney Mott\u2019s explanation of an \u201cinadvertent whistle.\u201d Followed by an epic Twitter rant by Dallas owner Mark Cuban. The amount of Cuban\u2019s expected fine likely will be announced with or soon after the verdict on Dallas\u2019 protest. If upheld, the teams \u2014 who aren\u2019t scheduled to meet again this season \u2014 would need to figure a time for the Mavericks to return to Atlanta to play those final few seconds. (Cuban recently told The Dallas Morning News that he\u2019d pass on the do-over if the game\u2019s outcome didn\u2019t affect his team\u2019s playoff positioning.) Theirs is the second protest this season, the eighth since 2010 and the 13th this century. Overall, based on the league\u2019s best available records, there have been 44 previous game protests \u2014 with only six upheld. Just one, a Miami beef over a statistician\u2019s error toting up Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s fouls in a January 2008 game , has been won since 1982-83. (The Heat won the protest but lost the replay anyway.) So how\u2019s it looking for the Mavs on this one? John Hollinger of The Athletic, who formerly worked in the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 front office, wrote: \u201cYou\u2019ve got better odds of seeing Boban Marjanovic on a mount in the Kentucky Derby than you do of seeing the Mavs\u2019 protest upheld.\u201d The high bar for successfully protesting the outcome of a game \u2014 and the resulting low success rate (13.6%, six of 44) \u2014 is by design, reflecting the NBA\u2019s views on referee performance. It distinguishes between human error and judgment vs. misinterpretation of rules, and tilts toward the integrity of its product in arenas. Just how rare it is for a protest to be upheld was made clear in longtime commissioner David Stern\u2019s email response to USA Today  back in 2014 , not long after he had stepped down from his post. He wrote: \u201cGiven the high standard of proof that a team must meet to have a protest sustained, I think our teams just decided that filing a likely losing protest was not a good use of time and resources.\u201d A protest process has been in place essentially since the league\u2019s inception. The first one came from the Indianapolis Olympians in February 1952, when they complained that a game official was incompetent. No surprise, it was denied. Here is the passage on protests that appears both in the official NBA rule book and in the league\u2019s Constitution: NBA commissioner Adam Silver is the final authority on protests. But the procedural work is handled by Byron Spruell, President, League Operations, and his office. They\u2019re the ones who needed only a few days to deny the Rockets\u2019 protest in December. That was filed after Harden dunked the ball so hard, up 13 in the fourth quarter on Dec. 3, that it snagged in the net and got ejected back out. It happened in an instant, the refs missed it and, since no whistle was blown, did not trigger a replay. Then the officiating crew denied Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s request to challenge, ruling (incorrectly) that it came too late. But the NBA ruled that San Antonio\u2019s overall 22-point comeback to win in double overtime, and the time to do so, argued against the Rockets\u2019 game-determining claims. The league did discipline the referees for not allowing D\u2019Antoni\u2019s challenge, which came during a Houston timeout rather than a game-mandatory break. Of the other major U.S. team sports, Major League Baseball\u2019s protest process is best known \u2014 and woven into its history. (Think about the \u201cPine Tar Game,\u201d between the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals in 1983.) Baseball doesn\u2019t have a great batting average of successful protests either \u2014 in fact, because most of its protests are lodged during play by an aggrieved club that ultimately wins the game anyway, many never get officially lodged. Basketball moves faster and protests only come after the final horn, by which time all other replays and arguments have been exhausted. The NFL? No official \u201cprotest machinery\u201d is available to the teams to dispute results with which they disagree. Probably because the New Orleans Saints still would be pounding on the commissioner\u2019s desk over this or this . The Dallas Mavericks\u2019 version of the Saints\u2019 post-elimination angst was Cuban\u2019s stream of vitriolic posts on Twitter in the wake of his team\u2019s defeat. https:\/\/twitter.com\/mcuban\/status\/1231411413068984320 https:\/\/twitter.com\/mcuban\/status\/1231414186271330312?ref_src https:\/\/twitter.com\/mcuban\/status\/1231418620133171200?ref_src While 13.6% of NBA protests have been upheld, requiring replay of some portion of the games in question, only 4.5% (two of 44) flipped the outcome, with the protesting team coming away with a victory. The first was in the 1952-53 season, after the Philadelphia Warriors lost a November game to the Milwaukee Hawks. The Hawks only had four eligible players left due to disqualifications but were incorrectly allowed to substitute in a fifth, en route to a 78-77 double-overtime victory. The protest required the teams to travel to Pittsburgh in March to play the entire game again. And this time, the Warriors won 72-69 in overtime. The second reversed outcome occurred in 1982-83 . On Nov. 30, 1982, the Lakers beat the Spurs in double overtime after a botched ruling near the end of regulation. That\u2019s when L.A. guard Norm Nixon, his team up 116-114, faked a free throw that had players from both teams jumping into the lane. The referees called for a jump ball, the Lakers got it, and Nixon scored a tying basket. NBA commissioner Larry O\u2019Brien ruled that the refs simply should have made Nixon shoot his free throw over. When the final seconds were replayed before an April meeting, San Antonio hung on to win 117-114. Because months can pass between original affront and protested remedy, life goes on, teams change and players move. That was the case in 1978-79 , when the Nets protested its Nov. 8 loss to the Sixers. New Jersey complained that three technical fouls were called on coach Kevin Loughery and forward Bernard King (two is and was the maximum, triggering ejection), resulting in too many free throws for Philadelphia. By the time the teams could replay the final 5:50 of the third quarter and the entire fourth, the teams had executed a trade. Harvey Catchings and Ralph Simpson went from Philadelphia to New Jersey, swapped for Eric Money and Al Skinner. So all but Skinner played for both teams in that one game. In the \u201cShaq protest\u201d in 2007-08 , Stern ruled that the final 51.9 seconds of overtime of Miami\u2019s Dec. 19 loss in Atlanta be replayed because O\u2019Neal only had five fouls, not six, after the scorekeeper\u2019s error put him out. That meant the big man still could compete when the teams properly finished the game on March 8. One snag: The Heat had traded O\u2019Neal to Phoenix on Feb. 6. So a protest lodged because Shaq was taken off the floor resulted in a replay in which Shaq no longer was on the floor. And since Shawn Marion was sent to Miami as part of that deal \u2014 and had played for the Suns in Dallas on Dec. 19 \u2014 he wound up officially playing two NBA games on the \u201csame night\u201d for two different teams. (The final 51.9 seconds, though replayed on March 8, were technically recorded as completing the Dec. 19 Heat-Hawks game.) That\u2019s even more rare than an NBA protest getting upheld. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

In the decade that just finished, think of the joy and drastic results when Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant in Oklahoma City and Joel Embiid in Philly recovered and made their returns. Or lately, when Zion Williamson finally suited up in New Orleans to help the team\u2019s playoff chase. And while the results don\u2019t reflect it right now, a healthy Victor Oladipo could prove beneficial to the Pacers come playoff time. But there\u2019s little to be gained, or even see, when this two-time Kia MVP returns on Thursday vs. Toronto ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) \u2014 to the team formerly known as the Warriors. This is no offense to Stephen Curry and the diligent therapists who whipped the 31-year-old into proper shape to finally finish what he barely started this season, but will anyone have reason to shake when he hits his next 3-pointer and feels the need to shimmy? By then, the Warriors will likely be down 10 points and eventually lose by 20. In other words, Curry will be a cute little diversion, perhaps on a minutes restriction at that, for a season too far gone for him to rescue. To paraphrase the poet Gertrude Stein when she once famously described the Warriors\u2019 former home base of Oakland, there\u2019s no there there in the Mission Bay district of San Francisco. A season without Klay Thompson from the start and then Curry (since he fractured his left hand Oct. 30) has been the eyesore we all expected \u2014 if not worse. The Warriors have the NBA\u2019s worst record and will not be that much more efficient now that Curry is bringing his Dyson vacuum cleaner to do the job. This season, though, has hardly been a complete waste. Far from it, actually. Beyond the gore of the standings, there\u2019s evidence of silver-lined prosperity. The Warriors wisely used this season to hold tryouts for next season and will come away with at least three rotational players who are working on the cheap. Warriors GM Bob Myers not only found Eric Paschall in the second round of the 2019 Draft, but gave him a three-year deal which allows the Warriors to keep a grinding power forward for cheap through 2021-22. The unspoken truth here is that the Warriors have all but guaranteed themselves at least the third pick in the 2020 Draft, with solid odds of getting No. 1 if they finish with one of the NBA\u2019s three worst records. This was always the grand prize of the grand plan, where a championship-contending team \u2014 they will qualify as that next season \u2014 adds a high Draft pick and grooms that player for the next 10 years. Or, the Warriors could take stock of a roster that\u2019s built to win now and package that pick for more immediate help. For example, they can possibly try to send the pick with Andrew Wiggins to Washington for Bradley Beal. Or get creative with that asset in other ways that will fortify an already solid roster. When Durant left for Brooklyn last summer, the Warriors were given license to recalibrate \u2014 a card they\u2019ve smartly played all season. They didn\u2019t do anything stupid just to win 25 games. They didn\u2019t rush Thompson back from knee surgery or run Draymond Green into the ground, and found a willing trade partner for D\u2019Angelo Russell, who was a bad fit. The fans in San Fran are cool with paying the price of a Tesla to sit and watch the Warriors lose because they know this is merely a bridge year. And besides, the Chase Center still has that arresting new-car smell, so who can resist? The Warriors conceivably will bring the championship-proven core of Curry, Thompson and Green \u2014 as well as Wiggins, that first-round pick, Paschall, an improved Damion Lee and Marquese Chriss and perhaps some other pieces \u2014 into 2020-21 and announce their re-arrival as a team to be taken seriously. In an era of small ball, the Warriors would be well-positioned to make noise once again after a brief bout with laryngitis. This was the perfect situation for the franchise to reset, take a short breather from five years of Finals runs, allow their stars to heal up and stay fresh, and not feel any pressure or pain of backlash. Only coach Steve Kerr\u2019s career winning percentage is taking a significant hit, and he\u2019ll stare at his three Warriors championship rings to make the pain go away. The dirty little secret is that Curry\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t season-ending, so the somewhat uncomfortable moment has finally arrived. There\u2019s no fear of re-injury, so nothing risky is at stake here. Just the same, there\u2019s also nothing to be gained, really. Hearing that Curry needs time to jell with Wiggins makes you laugh, considering those 14 or so games of precious \u201cbonding\u201d will be followed by five months of vacation. In a normal situation, had Durant stayed and the Warriors been whole, Curry would perhaps already be on the floor again. But with just more than a month left in 2019-20, the Warriors are stretching this delay out. The original target date of March 1 was scrapped because Kerr wanted Curry to get scrimmage time, so Curry got that with the Warriors\u2019 G League affiliate in Santa Cruz on Monday . Curry broke a sweat instead of a body part and got in a nice five-on-five run, while his teammates-for-a-day made out better in the deal: They got a photo with Curry and some memories. \u201cWhen he walked in, he was dapping everybody up, shaking hands, smiling, but he did his prep to get his body right,\u201d Santa Cruz coach Kris Weems said. \u201cAll his warm-up stuff, and that\u2019s important, too, that the guys, especially our younger guys, see the way his approach is, in terms of being a professional.\u201d The soft target date is Thursday against the Raptors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) for Curry. That means he\u2019d get a taste of Kyle Lowry as a warm-up, followed soon by LA Clippers guard Pat Beverley, who never brings any sympathy to the matchup. Even with Curry, the Warriors stand little chance of falling outside the bottom-three in the standings and ruining their prime Draft lottery status before the season ends. But there\u2019s nothing to be gained here except to tease a few fans whose imaginations are still stuck in 2018. Curry doesn\u2019t need playing time with Wiggins, and it doesn\u2019t matter how he meshes with many teammates who likely won\u2019t be around next season. Kerr will use a tight leash anyway (or at least he should). In terms of comebacks, Curry barely registers. Most fans are following Williamson\u2019s because at least there\u2019s something at stake for him and the Pelicans. Curry can get back to splashing, provide a few thrills and convince courtside fans at Chase Center to momentarily stop munching their soft shell crabs and watch the action. That\u2019s all good. But it\u2019s empty calories. This is a lost season that\u2019s far beyond the point of rediscovery. Seriously now, if a Curry 3-point shot falls in the woods, will anyone really notice? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It\u2019s Zion-vs.-Luka time (maybe)! When the current stars of the NBA fade from the spotlight one day, perhaps Luka Doncic and Zion Williamson will take their place there. A look at the Kia MVP chase shows we\u2019re a while away from either scenario, but a glimpse of the league\u2019s future will surely be on display tonight in Dallas ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). (Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that Williamson has not played in back-to-back games since his debut on Jan. 22 \u2014 and this game marks precisely that for the Pelicans.) Aside from assessing NBA futures, this game has serious playoff implications tied to it. Williamson\u2019s squad is just trying to get into the West picture , while Doncic\u2019s Mavs hope a stretch of upcoming home games helps them rise the playoff ranks a bit .  2. Pacers struggling vs. East elites A 37-24 mark and the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference is nothing for any team to sneeze at, least of all the injury-plagued Indiana Pacers. They head to Milwaukee next ( 7 ET, ESPN ) and need to show some improvement against the East\u2019s upper crust as the season wanes. The Pacers are a combined 3-7 against the Bucks, Raptors, Celtics and Heat \u2014 which are the four teams above Indiana in the standings. Post play could be of interest in this one if the last month\u2019s stats are of any indication : the Bucks rank No. 2 in post-ups per game (14.4) since Feb. 1, while the Pacers are 10th (11.1). Additionally, Victor Oladipo missed the Pacers\u2019 last game with right knee soreness, but he practiced Tuesday and may be on the mend. 3. A potential first-round series preview? The Heat are four games out from the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference and have a remaining strength of schedule of .476. The Magic are 1\/2 game behind the Nets for the No. 7 seed and have a .511 remaining strength of schedule. Anything is possible, standings-wise, down the stretch of 2019-20, as is a possible Heat-Magic first-round series come mid-April. Miami hosts Orlando next ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) in what will be the first game between dunking phenoms Derrick Jones Jr. of the Heat and Aaron Gordon of the Magic since their exciting AT&T Slam Dunk contest showdown. Don\u2019t sleep on what could be a good budding \u201crivalry\u201d game in the East. 4. Next step awaits Curry, Warriors Golden State fans haven\u2019t had much to get excited about lately, but perhaps that is about to change. Former Kia MVP winner Stephen Curry is seemingly on the fast track to play for the first time since Oct. 30 after Warriors coach Steve Kerr all but said as much on Tuesday. Kerr, Curry and Warriors director of sports medicine Dr. Rick [Celebrini are expected to talk today about whether or not Curry will suit up Thursday against the Raptors ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). 5. How will fans respond in New York? Knicks superfan and Oscar-winning writer-director Spike Lee made headlines Tuesday when he swore off going to games at MSG this season because of a disagreement he had with team officials on Monday. The Knicks are hosting the Jazz next ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), which, on paper is a decided mismatch in Utah\u2019s favor. However, this one is worth watching just to see if Lee keeps his word, who (if anyone) fills his seat and how the New York crowd reacts tonight to anything else in the wake of this latest news.

The Spurs topped the Hornets, 104-103 , and Popovich is expected to return to the bench for Friday night\u2019s game in Brooklyn ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Duncan, 43, retired in 2016 after playing 19 seasons with the Spurs, where he won five NBA championships, two Kia MVP awards and three Finals MVPs before joining the coaching staff in July of 2019. After the game, Duncan said his first stint as a head coach went well, but he\u2019s looking forward to Popovich\u2019s return. \u201cIt\u2019s night and day to be in the big boy chair,\u201d said Duncan, who normally serves as an assistant coach. \u201cTruth be told though, I wasn\u2019t in the big boy chair. I had (other assistant coaches) making the calls and I was the one standing there screaming at people.\u201d When asked if being a head coach is something he wants to pursue down the road, Duncan said, \u201cNope, Pop is going to be back and I will be happy to hand it right over to him.\u201d Duncan had plenty of help on the bench in assistants Becky Hammon, Will Hardy and Chip Engelland. H ammon has been on the Spurs\u2019 coaching staff since 2014, and Engelland joined the staff in 2005 while Hardy became an assistant back in July. Hornets coach James Borrego, who worked as an assistant coach for the Spurs when Duncan was there as a player, said it was \u201codd\u201d to look down at the other bench and see the five-time NBA champion and 15-time All-Star coaching a team.  \u201cI\u2019m used to see that No. 21 on his jersey and see him out there leading the group. Tonight he had a blazer on,\u201d Borrego joked. Borrego said he has immense respect for Duncan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be sitting here (as a head coach) if it wasn\u2019t for that guy,\u201d Borrego said. The Spurs\u2019 all-time leader in points (26,496), rebounds (15,091), blocked shots (3,020) and games played (1,392), Duncan ranks as just the third player in league history to capture 1,000 career regular-season victories, with only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish winning more games over their careers. In December of 2016, Duncan became the eighth Spur in franchise history to have his jersey retired, joining George Gervin (44), David Robinson (50), Sean Elliott (32), James Silas (13), Avery Johnson (6), Bruce Bowen (12) and Johnny Moore (00). Duncan played all 19 seasons of his NBA career for Popovich. He is surpassed in longevity with one team only by Dirk Nowitzki, who played 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, and the late Kobe Bryant,who played 20 seasons with the Lakers. Duncan retired ranked No. 2 in NBA playoff victories, first in postseason double-doubles and third in rebounds. The 15-year span between Duncan\u2019s first (1999) and last NBA titles (2014) rank as the second-longest span in league history behind Abdul-Jabbar (17 years) among players participating in both NBA Finals series, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Duncan and John Salley are the only players in league history to capture an NBA title in three different decades. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Michael C. Wright contributed to this report.

That was dashed by the Warriors on Saturday , though, when they announced Curry was on schedule to return sometime in March. While no definite return date has been set for Curry, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters Tuesday that Curry could be back as soon as Thursday. The Warriors host the Toronto Raptors that night ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) in a rematch of the teams in the 2019 Finals. Curry practiced with the Warriors\u2019 G League affiliate, the Santa Cruz Warriors, on Monday before returning to the parent club.

Lee said he won\u2019t be sitting there the rest of this season, anyway.

However, a Knicks spokesman said that was untrue and that it was simply an issue of Lee using the wrong entrance. The team issued a statement Tuesday that called Lee\u2019s claims \u201claughable.\u201d The full statement read as follows: \u201cThe idea that Spike Lee is a victim because we have repeatedly asked him to not use our employee entrance and instead use a dedicated VIP entrance \u2014 which is used by every other celebrity who enters The Garden \u2014 is laughable. It\u2019s disappointing that Spike would create this false controversy to perpetuate drama. He is welcome to come to The Garden anytime via the VIP or general entrance; just not through our employee entrance, which is what he and Jim [Dolan] agreed to last night when they shook hands.\u201d Knicks interim coach Mike Miller told reporters Tuesday that doesn\u2019t want Lee to stay away from MSG. \u201cWe want to see him out there every night,\u201d Miller said . Lee said he has been using the employee entrance on 33rd Street for more than two decades as a season ticket holder. The Knicks wanted him to use the entrance for celebrities, which is two blocks away. But Lee said he had already had his ticket scanned so he refused to leave, fearing that he wouldn\u2019t be allowed back in.

Before leaving, Curry made sure to snatch up his hardcover copy of Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book \u201cOutliers: The Story of Success.\u201d Somewhere in the book, in which Gladwell poses the question of what makes high-achievers different, Curry likely finds some semblance to his own story of perseverance. Undrafted out of college, Curry wasn\u2019t immediately launched to superstardom like his older brother, Stephen, a six-time NBA All-Star, two-time Kia MVP and three-time NBA champion. Yet through stints with two G League teams and six squads in the NBA, Seth Curry is still here and playing at a high level, particularly as of late. Curry\u2019s shooting 50.3% from deep since Jan. 1, the best mark in the NBA for players who have attempted at least 100 triples. He caught fire and scored 37 and 27 in his last two contests, making 11 of his 16 shots beyond the arc. Now in his sixth NBA season, Curry sat down with NBA.com to discuss his game, teammate Luka Doncic and the Mavericks\u2019 chances in the playoffs. (Editor\u2019s Note: Portions of this conversation have been condensed and edited.) You were in the Western Conference finals last year with the Blazers. What is the potential of this Mavericks team in the playoffs? We got a lot of potential. We\u2019re the best offensive team in the league. We\u2019re getting better defensively as the season rolls along. We just gotta be healthy, and like we learned last year it\u2019s about matchups in the playoffs. You want to put yourself in the best position. It\u2019s about managing your health and clicking on all cylinders. How do you feel you fit in this offense? Just trying to figure it out. There\u2019s a lot of space out there. I can spread the floor with my shooting. I can make plays off the dribble. It\u2019s a good offense for me to be in. I been in and out of the starting lineup all season, so just trying to get used to the lineups I\u2019ve been playing with. I feel like I\u2019m doing well so far. Statistically you\u2019re one of the best 3-point shooters ever, ranking second all-time among players that qualify. What does the work that you put in look like? Consistent habits all year long. I\u2019ve been doing it all my life. Just working on my game at all times. Sticking to the habits when I\u2019m not playing well, day in and day out. Trusting and not wavering from the stuff that\u2019s got me here. And continue to add stuff. What are some of those daily habits? First of all taking care of your body. Massaging, stretching, stuff like that. In the gym, it\u2019s about consistent shooting drills before practice and after practice. On game days, just sticking to my routine whether I feel like it or don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s about doing the same thing over and over and getting those reps that will eventually play off come game time. Do you have any favorite music that you listen to pregame? I listen to Drake nonstop. Old Drake, new Drake. He gives me the R&B and the rap. A lot of Atlanta guys like Gunna, Lil Baby, Future. All those guys. I listen to a lot of different stuff. How impressed are you with what Luka\u2019s been able to do? I\u2019m very impressed. He\u2019s very consistent with how he\u2019s playing, and we know he\u2019s talented and can do a lot of stuff. But he\u2019s bringing it every night. So that\u2019s probably the most impressive thing about him to me. Is there anybody in the league you can compare him to? He kind of does his own thing. I would say he\u2019s like LeBron [James] with his size and ballhandling, and playmaking ability. He can make all types of passes because he\u2019s so big and he can see everything. Obviously, he\u2019s not as athletic and he can shoot the ball better, but I think their styles of play are similar. What accomplishments do you expect from him over the next five years? He can win everything. Individually and collectively, he\u2019s got a chance to win everything from MVPs to championships. As long as he stays healthy and they keep the right pieces around him, he\u2019s got the chance to be great. What\u2019s the answer to that question regarding Seth Curry? (Laughs) I\u2019m still trying to get back to the playoffs and have a long, consistent career. I\u2019ve finally carved out a niche for myself in the league. So, I\u2019m just trying to stay healthy for multiple years and play a long time. Hopefully, I get a chance to stick in one place for a while. Who are your closest friends off the court in the NBA? I\u2019d say my brother. Damion Lee, my brother-in-law, Quinn Cook, Austin [Rivers], guys I played with at Duke. I\u2019m not one of those guys that\u2019s friends with everybody in the league. I\u2019ve got my close friends and close circle. That\u2019s pretty much it. When you\u2019re on the plane, what are some things you try to do besides sleep? I watch Netflix. I try to read a lot, I read a book a month and try to lock in. It\u2019s hard sometimes cause I want to watch a show. But I try to lock in and get that done. Who do you think has the best handles in the league? It\u2019s probably between Steph and Kyrie to me. They do it in different ways. Those two guys consistently handle the ball at a high level. Kyrie recently got ruled out for the season and Steph has decided to come back. You think that\u2019s smart on his part? Yeah, you want to get your rhythm back. You don\u2019t want to sit a full year. That\u2019s never good. When you love to play like he does \u2026 He\u2019s been trying to get back and be patient with his health. You never want to sit out a full year. He\u2019s trying to come back and play and give these fans a show. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about at the end of the day. It\u2019s about putting on a show for the fans and that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to do.  You\u2019ve been to a lot of your brother\u2019s playoff games over the years. What will it be like this postseason knowing the Warriors won\u2019t be there, which means he will actually be attending your games? (Laughs) Yeah, that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve thought about that one. Yeah, it might be weird. He\u2019s only been to a playoff game of mine when he was playing in it. So yeah, that might be a little weird. What was it like to get to play against him in the playoffs last season? It was a lot of fun, man. We were competing against one of the best teams of all time. Obviously, they didn\u2019t have KD (Kevin Durant). But they were very good. Then my parents were in the stands watching the games and stuff. So, it was a special experience for the whole fam. Do you appreciate where you are in your career now more considering the grind you had to endure to get here? Yeah, for sure. My path was a lot different. Obviously, I got it out the mud. I grinded for mine. I definitely appreciate it. I knew I had the talent. I was just trying to get the opportunity to show it at this level. I finally got it. So now I\u2019m just trying to play for a long time. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here  , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Nets said the procedure to relieve the impingement was performed by Dr. Riley Williams III at the Hospital for Special Surgery. The team said Irving is expected to make a full recovery. Irving began having trouble with the shoulder as he worked to get back in shape after another injury in the preseason. The pain worsened in November, early in the regular season, and he missed 26 games before returning in January. Irving got a cortisone shot on Dec. 24 but acknowledged that surgery still might be necessary. The decision to have it was reached last month on the night the Nets returned from the All-Star break. He finished with averages of 27.4 points, 6.4 assists and 5.2 rebounds, and became the first player in franchise history to have multiple 50-point games in a season. He also missed time because of a sprained right knee. Irving signed with Brooklyn in July along with Kevin Durant, who is expected to miss the entire season while recovering from surgery to repair his Achilles tendon. The Nets are trying to hang onto a playoff spot without them, sitting in eighth place in the Eastern Conference at 26-33 after four straight losses. Brooklyn plays Tuesday night in Boston, where Irving spent the last two seasons.

However, his return to the lineup may be shaped by factors other than his health. The Pistons announced Tuesday that an MRI of Rose\u2019s right ankle revealed a grade two sprain. He is expected to be re-evaluated in two weeks and will be out of the lineup until then. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports the Pistons are reportedly being cautious as to when to let Rose play. The team, Haynes reports, is considering turning more duties over to its younger players, a move that would likely improve its position for the 2019 Draft. Rose is enjoying his highest-scoring season since his most recent All-Star appearance with Chicago in 2011-12, averaging 18.3 points on 48.9 percent shooting. The Pistons were already struggling since dealing Andre Drummond to Cleveland and playing without Blake Griffin (knee surgery) for the rest of the season. Rose suffered his injury in the second quarter of Sunday\u2019s 106-100 road loss to the Sacramento Kings. The Pistons are interested in adding guard Jordan McRae, Haynes reports, but the Phoenix Suns are also planning to put a claim in on McRae too. McRae appeared in four games for the Denver Nuggets this season, averaging 2.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg and 1.0 apg in eight minutes per game. The Pistons will have the first chance to claim McRae because they have a worse record in the overall standings than the Suns, Haynes reports. The Pistons are 20-42 and in 12th place in the Eastern Conference, trailing the No. 8-seeded Brooklyn Nets by 7 1\/2 games in the standings. Since reaching the Eastern Conference finals in 2007, the Pistons have finished over .500 once (a 44-38 finish in 2015-16) and have 42 or more losses in nine of the past 12 seasons ."},{"id":28423,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-mailbag-march-3","date":"2020-03-03","title":"Kia MVP Ladder mailbag: Endorsement season gets rolling in award chase","content":" Now that we\u2019re in the thick of campaign season, it should surprise no one when endorsements start rolling in for the frontrunners for the 2019-20 Kia MVP. It need not be a solicited endorsement, either. Not in this social-media age where a viral clip does as much as (and, often, more than) any words about someone playing at that next level. Given how Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Russell Westbrook and others are performing down the stretch of 2019-20, we should expect to hear all sorts of arguments made on behalf of the guys vying for space on ballots. New Orleans Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry kicked it off over the weekend, after LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers held off a charge from Zion Williamson and his crew at Smoothie King Center. \u201cI\u2019m just amazed that they talk about anybody other than him for MVP,\u201d Gentry told reporters after LeBron collected his 13th triple-double of the season in the win. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does. Every team that he\u2019s been to, every team that he\u2019s gone have a chance to win the championship. To me, I\u2019m not sure what the definition of MVP is, but he makes everyone on his team better, makes it difficult for everybody playing him.\u201d We\u2019ve heard testimonials all season about the payers filling our the ranks of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, including these 21st birthday shout outs to Doncic last week . Don\u2019t get caught off guard when the hype train for a particular player cranks up. Just remember, it\u2019s a part of the process. Don\u2019t hate \u2026 Appreciate (like Jared Dudley): Find teammates who appreciate you the way Lakers veteran Jared Dudley does LeBron. Players of the week: Antetokounmpo and Dallas big man Kristaps Porzingis claimed Player of the Week honors in their respective conferences. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d season-long grind has been well documented. Porzingis had an uneven start to 2019-20, but has gone to another level recently. He\u2019s giving the Mavericks a second matchup nightmare to throw at defenses alongside Doncic and seems to just be getting started. * * * Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about the  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Giannis March 2, 2020 | 11:25 a.m. My name is also Giannis and I am from Greece too! As you can imagine I am a big fan of Anteto\u2026(we call him that for short.) I have watched every single game of the Bucks since Giannis entered the team and I must say this has been quite a ride so far. I do understand the passion of others towards their own star (Harden, Doncic, LeBron, etc.), but as you have said before: no one affects the game on both sides like Giannis does. W hat I see in Giannis is a strong will to be the best! He has struggled a lot in his life and now that he has reached the top, he did not let fame or money get in his brain. We have seen many others do the exact opposite when they reached his level of wealth and fame. I think this year they must win the championship or at least get to The Finals in order for him to stay in Milwaukee. My honest opinion is that, unfortunately, Giannis is not ready for the playoff intensity and that his jumper will, once again, be an issue. The only thing that might give Milwaukee the championship will be a critical shooting from the rest of the team come playoff time. * * * My response: I appreciate your honesty and concerns, Giannis. They are warranted, mostly because we have yet to see Giannis and the Bucks make that breakthrough run in the postseason that would match the success they\u2019ve enjoyed during these past two regular seasons. I will, however, respectfully disagree with your assessment that Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t ready for the playoff intensity. I\u2019d argue that he\u2019s finally ready, particularly after what the Bucks went through against Toronto in the 2019 conference finals. Time will tell, of course. From: Stephen Horn Feb. 25, 2020 | 8:03 p.m. Averaging 21 ppg, 6 rpg and 4 apg on 51%\/43%\/91% shooting splits at almost exactly 30 minutes a game! No, I don\u2019t think Khris Middleton is better than Giannis, but he\u2019s a top-five MVP candidate no question! Why do you think he gets absolutely no love for this? * * * My response:  Middleton gets plenty of love, Stephen. He\u2019s a two-time All-Star and the second best player on the NBA\u2019s best (regular-season) team for the second straight season. He\u2019s a max player and is well respected throughout the league. But a top five MVP candidate?That\u2019s pushing it, don\u2019t you think? From:  Jumel Feb. 25, 2020 | 8:16 p.m. I love your list, but I think LeBron should be No. 1. Have you seen the Lakers without him on the floor? Even without Giannis playing great, the Bucks still overcame Bradley Beal\u2019s 50-point game. LeBron steps off the court for 2 minutes and the Lakers forget how to play. * * * My response: The separation between Giannis and LeBron is as razor thin as it\u2019s been all season. They\u2019re both playing to their zenith in their respective situations. Any argument for LeBron to top your personal MVP list is valid. There\u2019s still enough of the regular season for LeBron or someone else in the top five to make a serious push to catch and pass Giannis. Doing it is another story. But the opportunity remains. From:  Da Ta Feb. 25, 2020 | 6:45 p.m. To be an MVP, does the player only need to score as much as they can? Or do they also need to get more rebounds and assists? My favorite player is LeBron James, who always tries to pass the ball. * * * My response: Great question. And yes, the Kia MVP needs to be so much more than just the guy who scores the most points. Not that scoring should be devalued in anyone\u2019s evaluation what makes a worthy MVP candidate. But it\u2019s only part of the game, an extremely important part of the game, of course. But far from the only one. They give out a trophy for the scoring champion every year. It\u2019s not the Maurice Podoloff Trophy. From:  Brandon Cole Feb. 25, 2020 | 6:22 p.m. Anthony Davis leads the Lakers in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, PER and other categories. But, of course, Sekou being Sekou, you somehow manage to make LeBron an MVP front runner when he is not even the best player on his own team. You manage to make LeBron an MVP front runner when he has another Top 5 player on his stacked team yet again, but you wouldn\u2019t afford those same luxuries to Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant and penalized them for joining forces. Y ou move the goalpost for LeBron every year in order to keep him in the running. Since when did \u201cbeing in year 17\u201d and \u201c35 years old\u201d have anything to do with being the MVP? And I GUARANTEE you, that if the roles were reversed, and LeBron led the Lakers in virtually EVERY STAT and metric, and AD led the NBA in REBOUNDS, you would not even attempt to make an argument for AD being the MVP. You would make sure to force the narrative that Lebron is \u201ccarrying\u201d the Lakers by leading them in basically every category. You have GOT to have more journalistic integrity, Sekou. It\u2019s disgusting to watch. This is the media \u201cgroupie\u201d stuff that KD was talking about when it comes to the toxicity surrounding LeBron. It\u2019s a disgrace that AD\u2019s tremendous season is being set aside as a footnote, just so you can push the LeBron narrative. * * * My response: That fantasyland you live in where the media drinks the LeBron Kool-Aid every day and carries out the mission to create this narrative that he\u2019s a leading MVP candidate seems like a scary place. To let you tell it, LeBron\u2019s the one who\u2019s been riding coattails and we\u2019ve all just dreamed up the last 16-plus seasons of his career. LeBron\u2019s successes, failures, accomplishments, deficiencies, milestones and missteps have all been carefully chronicled since he was 16 years old. He doesn\u2019t need an assist from me or anyone else. So you\u2019re disappointment is aimed in the wrong direction. It\u2019s funny: whenever folks don\u2019t get it their way, they want to blame the media and the narrative. It\u2019s weak, Brandon, especially coming from someone who says you played overseas like you have. From:  Elijah Henein Feb. 26, 2020 | 9:35 a.m. I don\u2019t have many complaints about your list this week, but after watching LeBron tear through the Pelicans almost single-handedly I believe that he should be at the top. LeBron has lead the league in assists all season and has showed how he can make everyone around him better, but last night he dominated like it was 2009! He showed his insane athleticism in year 17 of his career and got the dub. The scariest thing about this is it\u2019s not even the playoffs yet. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Giannis is one of the most elite players I\u2019ve ever seen, and he is the core of the historic season the Bucks are having. But the Lakers are not far behind and my opinion is that the Bucks have a better team around their two All-Stars then the Lakers do. But that\u2019s just my opinion. With that being said, I think it\u2019s gonna go right down to the wire between LeBron and Giannis this season as the best two players with the best two teams. * * * My response: I agreee, Elijah, this race is going down to the wire. Both Giannis and LeBron are putting on the show you\u2019d expect from the top two candidates. But the field is going hard down the stretch, too. This race is deeper than we\u2019ve seen in recent seasons and again, should stay interesting right up until the final night of the regular season. From:  Ernesto Marquez Feb. 26, 2020 | 9:31 a.m. What do you think about Jayson Tatum? He improved a lot and is having the best season of his young career. His scoring average is up almost 5 ppg (in only three more minutes per game), he\u2019s taking about seven 3-pointers a game and shooting around 40% from deep. Not only that, but he doesn\u2019t disappear in clutch moments and is leading Boston in clutch stats , improving his accuracy in field goals and 3-pointers in those moments. * * * My response:  Tatum has been on a tear recently, Ernesto, and that\u2019s been reflected in his rise up the ranks on the Ladder. The Celtics took a while to sort out roles with the addition of Kemba Walker, so Tatum didn\u2019t really get into a groove until we were already deep into this season. But if this is his new normal, I have a feeling he\u2019ll be a regular on the Kia Race to the MVP for Ladder for years to come. From: GP Feb. 26, 2020 | 9:49 a.m. I appreciate your responsiveness and transparency as it relates to your MVP Ladder. With that said, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how high you have Tatum climbing on the proverbial ladder. Since his All-Star selection, he\u2019s been basically unstoppable and was the hands down best player on the court against the likes of Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James and Anthony Davis (all of whom were previously in your Top 5 at some point). Prior to the All-Star break, Tatum gave Leonard a dose of his own medicine: locking him down defensively while scoring at will against him and the Clippers in a double-overtime instant classic. Following his 41-point masterpiece in the Staples Center on Sunday \u2014 and paying respects to his mentor, Kobe Bryant, on Monday \u2014 Tatum barely broke a sweat while dropping 36 points on a career high 8-for-12 shooting night on 3-pointer vs. Portland. In the loss to the Lakers, they had to trap him 25 feet from the basket to slow him down. While Walker has been sidelined with an injury, Tatum has put the Celtics on his shoulders during their post-All-Star break, West Coast trip. Accordingly, I look forward to seeing you and the media show Tatum some of that MVP love that he rightfully deserves. * * * My response: Tatum is delivering on all of that talent we saw from him as a rookie in the 2018 playoffs , GP. Tatum has got everything you want in an offensive catalyst as well as the size and athleticism to play four positions. The fact that he works on both ends at this early stage of his career is yet another reason why folks around the league feel like he\u2019s legitimate MVP candidate for years to come.  From:  Tommy LaVine Feb. 26, 2020 | 8 p.m. After LeBron\u2019s 40-point spectacle and Giannis going for 19 and 19, it has become crystal clear who the top two MVP finishers this year will be. The thing to me that really gives LeBron the edge \u2014 statistics aside in a neck-and-neck race \u2014 is just how genuinely good the Lakers\u2019 roster has looked compared to last year\u2019s disaster. I The addition of a talent like AD makes everything easier for everyone. But anyone who consistently watches the Lakers can tell that LeBron is by far the reason. This is the best version of his floor-general self that we have ever seen. Passes are always crisp and on point and his energizing highlight plays are the reason Lakers faithful have a reason to look forward to playoffs again. * * * My response: I think it\u2019s still more a of crowd right now than just a two-man race, Tommy. But Giannis and LeBron are clearly at the front of the pack. It\u2019s about finishing now. Who goes hard until the very end. And that\u2019s a good thing for all of us. From: Jennifer Kanaski Feb. 29, 2020 | 7 p.m. While Durant and Curry played together on the Warriors, the analysts all said that neither could ever win MVP while playing together. Both Harden and Westbrook are more recent MVPs, but this has not been said once in regards to them. Everyone loves to play both sides of the fence and say the Warriors were a championship team before Durant so it\u2019s unfair (and that they needed Durant to win). The Rockets made it quite clear that they felt they were robbed of a championship, making them a championship-caliber team before Westbrook arrived. Whether a player goes somewhere in free agency or is traded, why are the situations clearly viewed differently? * * * My response: I was not one of those analysts who felt like Steph and KD canceled one another out. They were both regulars on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder while they played together with the Warriors. We\u2019re in an era of dynamic duos and if Steph and KD were still together and healthy, they\u2019d be right in the MVP mix. In defense of all my fellow analysts, we\u2019ve had to recalculate some things in order to make the proper evaluations on what we\u2019re seeing now. Thanks for raising a very good point, though. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Walker hopes to play vs. Nets Boston has held things together over their last five games, going 3-2 during that span as each of those contests was played without All-Star guard Kemba Walker. The Celtics host the Nets next ( 7:30 ET, TNT ) and could have Walker back in the mix after he spent Monday taking part in his first practice since before the All-Star break. Whether or not Walker plays, though, the Celtics\u2019 Jayson Tatum has been one of the NBA\u2019s most efficient (and top-scoring ) players since the All-Star break, ranking in the Top 10 in both categories since then. 2. Lakers set to begin key homestand Over the next 12 days, the West-leading Lakers can essentially wrap up the No. 1 seed with a strong showing. They host the Philadelphia 76ers ( 10 ET, TNT ) to start a stretch where five of L.A.\u2019s next six games are at home (March 6 vs. Milwaukee, March 10 vs. Brooklyn, March 12 vs. Houston and March 15 vs. Denver). Since losing to the Sixers on Jan. 25, the Lakers are a West-best 10-4 and one of the best Defensive Ratings (106.6) in that span. They haven\u2019t lost to a team currently over .500 since Feb. 6, so this stretch will provide a critical proving ground for L.A. going forward. 3. Another test awaits OKC Of the teams in the No. 5-8 seed grouping in the West, the Thunder have the second-hardest remaining schedule (only the Grizzlies and Mavs have it tougher). After falling flat against the Bucks last Friday, Oklahoma City hosts the LA Clippers ( 8 ET, League Pass ) \u2014 a team it is 1-1 against this season. Overall, the Thunder are 25-14 against the West\u2019s teams over .500, but this will be the first time OKC faces the Clippers at full strength (and with new faces Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris). Both teams have much on the line tonight \u2014 LA is looking to pass Denver for No. 2 while OKC can keep pressure on Utah and Houston for the No. 5 and 4 seeds, respectively. 4. On this date in 2014: LeBron scores career-high In the 2014-15 season, LeBron James put on the best scoring show of his NBA life, pouring in 61 points to set a Miami Heat record in a 124-107 win against the Charlotte Bobcats. James made 22 of 33 shots from the field, including his first eight 3-point attempts. 5. Kings making a late playoff push Don\u2019t feel too bad if you had forgotten about Sacramento this season, especially after its 12-22 mark as of New Year\u2019s Eve. However, you should be catching some of the Kings\u2019 games as they are a respectable 14-12 since Jan. 1 , have won five of their last six games and are tied with the Blazers and Spurs in the chase for No. 8 in the West (3 1\/2 games back of the Grizzlies). Aside from that storyline, a matchup with the Wizards ( 10 ET, League Pass ) means a chance to see if Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal can keep his streak of 25-point games going, too.

The league, in a memo sent to teams on Sunday and obtained Monday by The Associated Press , offered 10 recommendations to players with hopes of decreasing risks of getting the virus \u2014 among them, not taking items such as pens, markers, balls and jerseys from autograph-seekers. The NBA also told teams that it is consulting with infectious disease experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and infectious disease researchers at Columbia University in New York. \u201cWe are also in regular communication with each other, NBA teams including team physicians and athletic trainers, other professional sports leagues, and of course, many of you,\u201d the league wrote in its memo to teams, their physicians and athletic training staffs.

The coronavirus remains a situation with the potential to change rapidly \u2014 the NBA and the Players Association will continue to work with leading experts and team physicians to provide up-to-date information and recommended practices that should be followed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the league said in the memo. Many of the tips offered by the NBA fell under common-sense level of best practices when it comes to illness prevention: avoiding contact with people who are sick, staying home when feeling ill, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. The league also suggested players make sure they are up to date with all routine vaccinations, including the flu vaccine. The worldwide death toll topped 3,000 on Monday, and the number of those infected rose to about 89,000 in 70 countries on every continent but Antarctica.

Now he will try to turn around one of its weakest franchises. The New York Knicks hired Rose as their president Monday, hoping he can sign and draft the kind of dominant players he\u2019s been representing. Rose is taking over a team headed toward its seventh straight season out of the playoffs. But teams such as Golden State and the Lakers have found success handing their basketball operations to an agent and the Knicks believe he can do the same. \u201cLeon is one of the most respected executives in professional basketball, with decades of experience successfully working with NBA players and team management in all facets of the game,\u201d Madison Square Garden executive chairman James Dolan said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident he brings the right combination of expertise and relationships to ensure the long-term success of our franchise.\u201d Rose, the former co-head of the basketball division at CAA Sports, replaces Steve Mills, who was fired early last month .

Now he will oversee all personnel and decisions for the Knicks. \u201cNew York is the epicenter of basketball and Madison Square Garden has always been very special to me,\u201d Rose said. \u201cTo be a part of the Knicks revitalization and basketball at the Garden is a challenge and a rare opportunity, one to be cherished, and I will do my utmost to make the fans, the city and ownership proud.\u201d The Warriors won three championships and went to five straight NBA Finals under former agent Bob Myers, and the Lakers are leading the Western Conference while being run by Rob Pelinka, who was Kobe Bryant\u2019s agent. Rose is a New Jersey native who played basketball at Dickinson College and coached at the college and high school levels. He has spent plenty of time around the Garden, giving him an up-close look at the work that will need to be done. The Knicks are 18-42 and already assured a seventh straight losing season. They fired coach David Fizdale after just 22 games and then split with Mills just before the trade deadline. This season\u2019s troubles started long before that. The Knicks hoped their turnaround could begin in July, when they had enough salary-cap space to sign two top players. But they couldn\u2019t get any and settled for lesser choices, assembling a roster that never fit. The Knicks hope Rose, with his 25 years of building player relationships, can attract stars, many of whom say they love playing at MSG but not for the home team. Not since Anthony, who sought and eventually got a trade to New York from Denver in 2011, has a marquee player picked the Knicks. He helped New York make the playoffs in his first three seasons, including a division title in 2013. But there have been no postseason appearances since. Rose will have to make decisions on the Knicks\u2019 ever-changing coaching and front office staffs. Mike Miller took over as interim coach when Fizdale was fired in December, and general manager Scott Perry has run the basketball operations since Mills\u2019 departure. As for the roster, the Knicks do have seven first-round picks over the next four years and believe they have some promising young players already in place, such as rookie RJ Barrett and second-year center Mitchell Robinson. Many of the veterans signed last summer were given short-term deals, allowing the Knicks to quickly go back into the free agency market. Rose plans to take his time evaluating the organization, and he gets his first look at the team from his new post Monday night when the Knicks host the Houston Rockets. \u201cNothing about this is easy, or quick, so I ask for your continued patience,\u201d Rose wrote in an email to season-ticket holders. \u201cWhat I promise you in return is that I will be honest and forthright. We will develop a plan that makes sense, both to jumpstart our short-term growth and ensure our long-term success.\u201d"},{"id":28418,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2019-20-week-20","date":"2020-03-02","title":"Power Rankings, Week 20: Clippers climb back into Top 5; big week lies ahead for Lakers","content":" With the league scoring 109.7 points per 100 possessions, last season was the most efficient in the 23 years for which we have play-by-play data, and likely the most efficient season in NBA history. Over the past week, the current season eclipsed that mark. Having scored 110.9 points per 100 over 82 games since the All-Star break, the league is now at 109.8 for the season. League-wide turnovers are up and both free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage are down from last season. But the most important aspect of offense is shooting. Over its first 63 seasons, the NBA never had a league-wide effective field goal percentage of 50%. It hit that mark for the first time in 2009-10, dipped back under 50% for four of the next five seasons, and has increased in each of the last five years, from 49.6% in 2014-15 to a record 52.7% this season. And that\u2019s with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson having attempted at total of 66 shots. Just four seasons ago, the league average was 105.6 points per 100 possessions, a rate that all but three teams have eclipsed this season. The Oklahoma City Thunder have a top-10 defense, having allowed 108.5 per 100. One team is still defending like it\u2019s 1999. That\u2019s the Milwaukee Bucks, who are at No. 1 in the Power Rankings for a 14th straight week (how boring!), having held their last three opponents (including two of the best teams of the last two months) under a point per possession.

Can anyone in the East slow Milwaukee? Game after game, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks are making this whole winning-games-in-the-NBA thing look pretty simple. Antetokounmpo had a 40-20 game in a romp against the Hornets on Sunday to give Milwaukee its sixth straight win. In theory, a stiffer test awaits tonight as the Miami Heat host the Bucks ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ) in what should be a showdown of East powers. In reality, the Bucks are dominating the East\u2019s winning teams, too, going 33-4 against them as they haven\u2019t lost to such a team Feb. 12 vs. the Pacers. There is a challenge schedule stretch a 2. Phenoms face off in Atlanta The Hawks and Grizzlies are two of the more intriguing young squads in the NBA today thanks to their young star guards. Atlanta\u2019s All-Star Trae Young has been one of the most thrilling scorers and playmakers of 2019-20, while Memphis rookie Ja Morant has his team on the cusp of an unexpected playoff berth. They meet tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ) in what could be a showdown chock full of highlights. If you were building an NBA team from scratch and could pick one of them to be your guard of the future, which would would you take? 3. On this date: Wilt scores 100 On March 2, 1962, legendary center Wilt Chamberlain set the NBA single-game scoring record by tallying 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors in a 169-147 victory over the New York Knicks. No one has come close to touching that mark since, which makes it one of the most remarkable feats in sporting and NBA lore. 4. Spurs, Pacers headed in opposite directions Indiana is finding its groove again, having won three straight and five of its last six games. The same can\u2019t be said for San Antonio, which continues to struggle and is 3-7 in its last 10 games as it hosts the Pacers ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). The Spurs will have to find a way to slow down T.J. Warren (who is averaging 22.2 ppg over his last six games) and Domantas Sabonis (18.7 ppg, 12.0 rpg in his last six games). Since the All-Star break, Indiana ranks No. 3 in Defensive Rating (101.6) and No. 9 in Net Rating, while the Spurs are 12th and 23rd, respectively, in those categories since then. 5. Rose injured in loss to Kings From injuries to trades to buyouts, this season has been a forgettable one for most Pistons fans. Last night in Sacramento, Detroit not only blew a 17-point lead to secure its eighth straight road loss, but also saw Derrick Rose go down with an ankle injury . An injury to him would be cruel on several levels, with the greatest disgrace of all being that Rose is averaging 18.3 ppg on 48.9 percent shooting \u2014 his best performance since the 2011-12 season with the Bulls."},{"id":28420,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-cant-miss-matchups-zion-williamson-luka-doncic","date":"2020-03-02","title":"5 Can't-Miss Matchups: Zion Williamson vs. Luka Doncic","content":" First-time battles between rising stars highlight this week\u2019s edition of can\u2019t-miss matchups, and in one instance \u2014 Trae Young versus Ja Morant \u2014 there\u2019s an opportunity to watch them square off twice in a span of five days. Morant and Zion Williamson, who faces off with Luka Doncic on Wednesday, rank first and second in the league among rookies with nine and five games, respectively, in which they\u2019ve racked up 20 points or more on 60% or better shooting this season. But you should also keep your eyes peeled for clashes between NBA All-Star Game captains Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James set for Friday at 10:30 p.m., ET on ESPN, and a potential playoff preview Thursday on TNT that pits Russell Westbrook against Paul George. * * * \u2022 Wednesday, March 4 (9:30 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Haven\u2019t met yet. Dallas and New Orleans have met three times this season with the Mavericks claiming victory in each of the contests. But this matchup marks the first featuring Williamson, who missed the first 44 games due to a knee injury, going head to head with Doncic. The Mavericks held out Doncic (left thumb sprain) for Sunday\u2019s game against the Timberwolves, but the injury isn\u2019t considered serious. So, we should see Doncic in this one. Williamson, meanwhile, finished the weekend ranked No. 10 in offensive rebounding percentage among players averaging 20 minutes per game and has averaged 28.2 points in his last six outings. Doncic called Williamson \u201ca monster\u201d during All-Star weekend, and we don\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong. \u2022 Friday, March 6 (10:30 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 19, 2019. These players occupy the top two spots in the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder , and although Antetokounmpo is 5-14 overall in this series, he\u2019s won three of the last four outings against James. In fact, Antetokounmpo shot 57.9% from the floor in his last outing against James and 62.5% from deep for 34 points to go with 11 rebounds. The Bucks finished the weekend on a six-game winning streak, and believe it or not, James has guarded Antetokounmpo for just 1:04 this season with the Bucks star scoring 2 points on 1-of-2 shooting Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Monday, March 2 (7:30 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Haven\u2019t met yet. Steve Nash got these guys together over All-Star weekend, and we finally get to see them in action going head to head twice in the same week. So, take your pick here. First up is a showdown on Monday in Atlanta ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), followed by a game in Memphis on Saturday ( 8 ET, League Pass ). The stakes are high in both games considering Memphis is clinging to the eighth spot in the West. These young stars are the future at the point guard position in the NBA. \u2022 Wednesday, March 4 (7 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 13, 2019. Veteran star point guards clash in this one. Rose is a three-time NBA All-Star and former MVP, while Paul is a 10-time All-Star. Danilo Gallinari called Paul the \u201cbest leader\u201d he\u2019s ever played with, and for good reason as the veteran is one of the main reasons Oklahoma City has exceeded expectations after trading away Russell Westbrook and Paul George over the summer. Rose, meanwhile, is one of the few bright spots and the veteran leader of a Detroit rebuild that saw four new players join the team just in the month of February. Although Rose is 8-4 against Paul in the regular season, the latter owns a postseason record of 4-1 in this matchup. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Thursday, March 5 (8 p.m., ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 19, 2019. This display of chemistry between former teammates seems like an eternity ago, doesn\u2019t it? But here we are with the former teammates and close friends now playing for new teams. George has won three of the last five matchups against Westbrook, but the Rockets\u2019 new guard is playing at a Kia MVP-type level now as Houston has gone all-in on small ball. Westbrook averaged 33.4 points in February, and shot 54.9%, which ranks as the best shooting month of his career. He\u2019s done most of his damage of late by attacking the rim, which poses a formidable challenge for George, who is considered one of the league\u2019s elite defenders. If you lose interest in this battle, you can always focus in on how Kawhi Leonard defends James Harden. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Wednesday, March 4 (7:30 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 1, 2020. Here\u2019s a quick refresher if you need it for what went down between these players as one of the most memorable AT&T Slam Dunk contest finishes in recent history. Jones\u2019 parlayed his narrow victory over Gordon in the contest into a multiyear footwear and apparel endorsement deal with Puma, despite Gordon clearing 7-foot-6 Celtics rookie Tacko Fall for a two-handed dunk on his final attempt. Although winning the game is the top priority here, we anticipate on some level at least a small continuation of what we saw between these high risers back in February. Gordon scored 24 points on 9-of-20 shooting in the last matchup between these teams. But Jones and the Heat have come out victorious in the last two meetings.

ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin and Adrian Wojnarowski report the Lakers plan to bring in former Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters for a workout on March 2 . Additionally, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reports JR Smith will work out for the Lakers later this week as well. Smith has not played in the NBA since last season while Waiters played in three games with the Heat earlier in 2019-20. Smith teamed with James in Cleveland from 2014-18 and proved, at times, to be a critical piece for the Cavaliers in their run to The Finals each of those seasons. In Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, Smith finished with 12 points on 5-for-13 shooting (2-for-8 on 3-pointers) as Cleveland won the NBA title . Things went down hill for Smith after James left the Cavs to sign with the Lakers before the 2018-19 season. He played in just 11 games that season and stepped away from the team in hopes of being traded or released. He was ultimately waived by the Cavs last summer and has been awaiting a new team since then. Waiters last played on Jan. 28 of this season and has been dogged by poor conditioning and suspensions. He was dealt to Memphis as a part of the Andre Iguodala swap in early February , but was cut by the Grizzlies shortly thereafter . Oddly enough, Waiters was a part of the 2015 trade that brought Smith to Cleveland and sent Waiters to Oklahoma City for the next 1 1\/2 seasons. After that, he signed with the Heat as a free agent in 2016 and had an up-and-down tenure with Miami. There are significant ties between Waiters, James and the Lakers, per Wojnarowski and McMenamin. Waiters was a client of current Lakers GM Rob Pelinka back when he was an agent and is represented by Rich Paul of Klutch Sports \u2014 who also represents James and Lakers big man Anthony Davis. Per ESPN, the Lakers have been interested in acquiring another scoring playmaker for their second unit. The Lakers are 46-13 and lead the Western Conference, holding a 5 1\/2-game lead over the Denver Nuggets and LA Clippers.

Rose, who put up nine points, three rebounds and two assists in just nine minutes of action on Sunday, did not return after injuring his right ankle during the second quarter. The Pistons promptly saw a double-digit lead dwindle before falling 106-100 at Sacramento. There is no immediate timetable for Rose\u2019s return. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet.

We\u2019re more than 70% through the season and the playoffs are just seven weeks away. Here are some things of note as we head into the Week 19 weekend\u2026 Usually, when you browse the plus-minus column in a box score, the numbers for reserves on the same team don\u2019t vary much. The bench guys played most of their minutes together and the team either performed well, poorly, or average in those minutes. But in the Lakers\u2019 win over the Pelicans on Tuesday, we saw the following from four of L.A.\u2019s six reserves\u2026 Kuzma and Caruso both came off the bench, but the only time they were on the floor together was the last 46 seconds of the game, when Lakers coach Frank Vogel took out his two All-Stars \u2014 LeBron James and Anthony Davis \u2014 with his team up 11. Caruso didn\u2019t enter the game until the 8:48 mark of the second quarter. Single-game plus-minus can help tell the story of the night, but it shouldn\u2019t lead to any conclusions beyond those 48 minutes. Still, the Lakers outscoring their opponents by more than a point per minute with Caruso on the floor isn\u2019t a total anomaly. Caruso ranks ninth on the Lakers and fifth among Laker guards in minutes per game (18.0), behind Rajon Rondo (20.8). But the best team in the West has been at its best with Caruso on the floor. In his 972 total minutes, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 12.2 points per 100 possessions, the *third best on-court NetRtg mark among non-Bucks who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 30 games or more. * Behind those of the Nuggets\u2019 Paul Millsap (+14.0) and the Raptors\u2019 Terence Davis (+12.3). In 445 minutes with both James and Caruso on the floor, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 24.7 points per 100 possessions, the best mark among 719 combinations that have played at least 400 minutes together. Caruso ranks 270th in usage rate (having used just 13.6% of the Lakers possessions while he\u2019s been on the floor) among 319 players who have played at least 500 minutes. His 11.0 points and 3.7 assists per 36 minutes rank 276th and 102nd among that same group of 319 players. But his impact is felt on the other end of the floor, where the Lakers have allowed less than a point per possession in his 972 minutes. His 2.1 steals and 4.0 deflections per 36 both rank 10th. At a key moment in that win over the Pelicans on Tuesday, Caruso blocked Lonzo Ball at the rim and then stole the ball from his former teammate two possessions later. The Pelicans, who rank fourth offensively since Christmas (114.9 points scored per 100 possessions), scored just 31 points on 42 possessions with Caruso on the floor. It seems that Vogel hasn\u2019t totally bought into Caruso\u2019s plus-minus magic. The guard has averaged fewer minutes since Jan. 1 ( 15.4 ) than he did prior ( 20.0 ). No five-man lineup that includes Caruso has played more than 71 total minutes , and the two that have played more than 33 minutes also include Rondo. But Vogel has, more often than not, had Caruso on the floor with the game on the line. Caruso has played 36.5% of his regulation (non-overtime) minutes in the fourth quarter, a rate which ranks *second among 267 players who have played at least 750 regulation minutes total. Some of that is garbage time, but Caruso ranks fourth on the team in clutch minutes. The Lakers have played 25 games that were within five points in the last five minutes, and he\u2019s been on the floor down the stretch of 18 of those. * The Pacers\u2019 Doug McDermott is the player who has played the largest percentage of his regulation minutes (38.5%) in the fourth quarter. At the other end of the list, this season\u2019s Carlos Boozer if you will, is the Clippers\u2019 Ivica Zubac, who has played only 5.5% of his regulation minutes in the fourth quarter. The Lakers\u2019 JaVale McGee (9.3%), Danny Green (14.3%) and Avery Bradley (14.7%) are third, seventh and ninth from the bottom. The Lakers didn\u2019t get the playmaking guard they were seeking in the buyout market. But they may benefit by giving a little more playing time to one they already have on the roster. Their next opportunity to do so is Saturday, when the Lakers visit the Memphis Grizzlies ( 8 ET, League Pass ). They\u2019ll then play the Pelicans again in the second game of a back-to-back on Sunday ( 8 ET, ESPN ). Whether they\u2019re playing with a center or without one, the Houston Rockets do not have the most complicated offense. The floor is spread and the ball is in James Harden\u2019s hands. The Rockets rank 30th in player movement, with their five players averaging just 10.6 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession. Over the course of a game, few plays are called. But watch closely when the Rockets come out of a timeout (or at the start of a period), and you\u2019ll see some creative stuff from coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. According to Synergy tracking, the Rockets lead the league in after-timeout efficiency, having scored 1.06 points per possession out of timeouts. They rank second offensively overall (114.0 points scored per 100 possessions), and there\u2019s obviously a strong correlation between overall efficiency and after-timeout efficiency. But when you compare the two, the Rockets see the biggest jump in efficiency coming out of timeouts. Note: Synergy tracks efficiency a little differently in that an offensive rebound starts a new \u201cpossession.\u201d And it\u2019s not because they just give the ball to Harden and let him go to work. Sure, at times, they will run a standard action to let Harden do just that. Here\u2019s the Rockets\u2019 first play of the third quarter against Boston earlier this month, where Harden feigns like he\u2019s not part of the play before darting off a cross-screen from P.J. Tucker. He attacks the close-out of Jaylen Brown and gets Tucker a layup. Even that play is a non-standard way of getting the ball in the hands of the league\u2019s leading scorer . And D\u2019Antoni has some more tricks up his sleeve to get other guys good shots. There\u2019s some fun (though not that complicated) stuff in his out-of-timeout playbook. In this space in early December , we looked at \u201c point single weak ,\u201d a play the Rockets have run over the last few years to get P.J. Tucker a corner 3. In January, they unveiled a simple \u201celevator doors\u201d variation for Ben McLemore\u2026 Here are a few more *D\u2019Antoni creations from the last month\u2026 * Not all of these are necessarily new this season (the Rivers back-screen is a familiar one) and it\u2019s always possible that any of them have been \u201cborrowed\u201d from other coaches. Playing without a center presumably allows D\u2019Antoni to be more creative. The Rockets are 9-2 since they last played with a center, ranking third offensively and 10th defensively over that stretch. Their current five-game winning streak began with a win over the Boston Celtics, who the Rockets will visit on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ABC ). The Washington Wizards have fallen to 13th in offensive efficiency after ranking in the top five through early January . But they\u2019re second in after-timeout efficiency at 1.02 points per possession, according to Synergy. The Wizards also have an elevator doors play . And here\u2019s a fun, multi-action set they ran against Memphis earlier this month\u2026 Because it involves the Wizards\u2019 two most dangerous shooters, a Davis Bertans back-screen for Bradley Beal (after the first four passes) looks like the action that will gain the Wizards an advantage somewhere. But Troy Brown isn\u2019t really looking for Beal as he rubs off the screen. Instead, Brown swings the ball back to the right side of the floor, where Beal is running off a pin-down screen from Mo Wagner. Both defenders jump out toward Beal, who finds an open Wagner under the basket with the seventh pass of the possession. The Atlanta Hawks rank 11th in after-timeout efficiency, but that\u2019s a big difference from where they rank overall offensively (25th). The Hawks generally don\u2019t go out of the box out of timeouts, mostly relying on the pick-and-roll playmaking of Trae Young. He got DeAndre Hunter an open look for a game-tying 3 against the Heat last week by driving past Bam Adebayo\u2019s attempt at a switch. The Hawks will also give Kevin Huerter some opportunities to make plays, almost always attacking the middle of the floor with the ball in his right hand, out of timeouts. The Spain pick-and-roll is a play that a lot of teams run, and the Hawks will use it to get Young, Huerter and John Collins all involved in the same action. They got an open 3 for Huerter with it against the Celtics earlier this month\u2026 With Huerter setting a back-screen on Enes Kanter, Jayson Tatum remains in the lane to help on Young\u2019s drive. Huerter then pops out for the open 3. The Milwaukee Bucks rank third in both overall efficiency and after-timeout efficiency. Early last season, we looked at three different options off a baseline cross-screen set for Giannis Antetokounmpo that they still run. And here was a sideline out of bounds play that worked for them a couple of times in their win in Toronto on Tuesday\u2026 Jimmy Butler got blocked by three Timberwolves at once on his attempt at a game-winning drive in the final seconds on Wednesday. Two possessions prior to that, Butler missed a short turnaround bank shot for the lead with 30 seconds on the clock. Butler has now taken 15 shots for the tie or the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime in his first season with the Heat. He tied the Heat\u2019s game against the Hawks on Dec. 10 with a 3-pointer with 29.8 seconds left in regulation, but he\u2019s missed the other 14 of those shots. With the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, Butler is 17-for-54 (31.5%), the worst mark among 20 players with at least 50 clutch field goal attempts. A year ago, Butler made two (almost identical) game-winning 3s ( one , two ) in his first two weeks with the Sixers. He finished last season 6-for-8 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth or OT, with the last of those being the fast break bucket that preceded Kawhi Leonard\u2019s Game 7 buzzer-beater. He was clutch last season. He\u2019s been very unclutch this season. For his career, Butler is 30-for-85 (35.2%) on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. That is better than the league average (32.7%) in those situations over the nine seasons he\u2019s been in the league. Butler\u2019s next chance at a game-winner could come this weekend. The Heat, who have lost seven of their last nine games and are in danger of losing a top-four seed in the East, host the Mavs on Friday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and the Nets on Saturday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). The highlight of their five-game homestand is a matchup with the Bucks on Monday ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ). Zach LaVine is tied with Butler for the most field goal attempts to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime, and LaVine has made just three of his 15 attempts, tying him for 10th with the most made buckets in that situation. In the same category as Butler (clutch last season, not clutch this season) is Luka Doncic. The birthday boy was 6-for-11 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute last season, but is 0-for-6 this season. Here are the nine guys with more than three buckets to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth or OT\u2026 So Damian Lillard leads the league with seven, and he\u2019d have one more if the referees correctly called goaltending on his drive for the tie in Utah earlier this month. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

No other NBA team has moved so far, so fast, in terms of the standings and, frankly, in terms of their own expectations. The party being crashed Friday night is in Milwaukee ( 8 p.m. ET, ESPN ), where the runaway Bucks \u2014 50-8 and 110-30 since the start of 2018-19 \u2014 have been their own brand of modest profile relative to heavyweight real or alleged like the Lakers, Celtics, Clippers or Sixers. But you could win a few bar bets asking stool neighbors to name the NBA team with the second-most victories and third-best winning percentage since Thanksgiving . OKC is 31-11 (.738) since then, ranking behind only Milwaukee (35-5, .875) in total wins and the Bucks and Lakers (29-10, .744) in win percentage. Not bad for a bunch of players and coaches supposedly keeping seats warm for the 137 draft picks over the next 10 years GM Sam Presti has accumulated (OK, eight over the next seven years in addition to the Thunder\u2019s own picks in that span. Presti also has four pick-swap options from 2021-25). Already, OKC has made many of the experts\u2019 2019-20 predictions look silly. It could lose its final 23 games and still prove ESPN wrong, which projected the Thunder to go 33-49 and finish 13th in the West . CBSSports.com\u2019s Brad Botkin at least considered OKC a playoff team, suggesting 46 victories. The New York Times\u2019 Benjamin Hoffman made this his NBA \u201cwild prediction\u201d for 2019-20: \u201cAfter trading away both Russell Westbrook and Paul George, will finish within five wins of last year\u2019s total of 49. And it may not be five less.\u201d On NBA.com, it was more bright than dark : \u201cAs currently constituted, there\u2019s enough talent and experience to snag a low playoff berth in the West.\u201d What the Thunder have accomplished so far, though \u2014 14-3 in the past 17 games, 16 victories in the past 19 road games, 10th in offensive rating (111.4) and 11th defensively (108.3) \u2014 has come from more than talent and experience. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to expect coming in \u2014 and I don\u2019t say that in terms of how good I thought we could be,\u201d coach Billy Donovan said in Chicago this week. \u201cI thought we could be a very, very good team. But the thing you don\u2019t know is, how are nine new players all going to jell and mesh in a short period of time? And learn and understand how to play with one another, and try to bring out each other\u2019s strengths? \u201cTo those guys\u2019 credit, we\u2019ve played two of the three [point] guards together, we\u2019ve played three of the three guards together, we\u2019ve done a lot of different things. But they\u2019ve done a great job of building a chemistry, a bond, in a short period of time.\u201d Chris Paul made the All-Star Game for the first time since 2016 and has resuscitated his reputation by knitting together a crew of familiar faces, newcomers and placeholders. He has mentored Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (19.4 ppg), helped Danilo Gallinari (41.0 3FG%) and Steven Adams (11.2 ppg, 9.5 rpg) reach peak performance and boosted rookies Darius Bazley and Luguentz Dort as productive starters. \u201cOur intensity and character are two things that are getting better and better,\u201d Gallinari said after OKC rallied to beat Sacramento on Thursday. The Thunder bench may lack many household names, but Kia Sixth Man candidate Dennis Schr\u00f6der (19.0 ppg, 4.1 apg) and big man Nerlens Noel have helped it outscore other reserves in 42 out of 59 games. Donovan has had much to do with it, too. Freed in his fifth NBA season from serving George\u2019s and especially Westbrook\u2019s ball-dominant styles, he was named the West\u2019s Coach of the Month after OKC\u2019s 11-4 December. They have gone 19-7 since, likely earning Donovan Coach of the Year votes, too. His use of Paul, Gilgeous-Alexander and Schr\u00f6der together has helped earn OKC the NBA\u2019s best net rating (9.8) in fourth quarters; Milwaukee ranks a distant second at 7.0. The plucky Thunder have had comeback victories this season vs. Chicago (26 points), Memphis (24), the Clippers (18) and Sacramento (19).  \u201cIt\u2019s like we flipped a switch,\u201d Paul said. It\u2019s like the Thunder have pulled a switcheroo, meanwhile, from everything we thought they\u2019d be \u2014 and not be. No one knew if Paul would engage fully after what looked like a banishment from Houston (where the Rockets were 89-27 the past two seasons when he played) or maybe get dealt to shake free of his enormous contract. No one knew if Adams, Gallinari and Schr\u00f6der might follow him out the door by the trade deadline earlier this month. For certain, few Bucks fans knew their team would be facing such a formidable opponent when they bought their tickets for Feb. 28. \u201cI was very optimistic going into the year,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cChris Paul has obviously been an elite player for a long, long time. So has Gallinari. I coached Steven and Dennis. I heard nothing but great things about Shai coming in. I had been around Nerlens, so I knew him. So I was optimistic. It wasn\u2019t like going into the year I thought we couldn\u2019t compete. \u201cWe need to keep getting better. April 15 [when the regular season ends] will be here soon enough.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They\u2019re doing it as teammates for the first time, of course. (The last time they teamed up \u2014 as young players in Oklahoma City \u2014 neither was yet in this kind of space). B oth have claimed Kia MVPs ( Westbrook in 2017 ; Harden 2018 ) and been contenders in seasons before and after collecting that honor. Doing it all now as the two-headed monster leading the Houston Rockets\u2019 small-ball championship campaign, however, is a testament to the immense talents of these childhood friends from southern California. The Rockets have won five straight and eight of their last 10 games, embracing every wrinkle of their new attack \u2014 all while redefining their season in the process. \u201cWe\u2019re finally getting there defensively and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take for us to win games,\u201d Harden said after the Rockets throttled the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. \u201cIf we want to get to where we want to go, we have to engage and lock in on the defensive end, and we did that.\u201d After an uncharacteristic rough patch last month, Harden is back to his scorching ways. Westbrook, though, has transformed into the best version of himself in a Rockets uniform. He\u2019s tearing through the competition (averaging 34.0 ppg and shooting 57% in the six games since Clint Capela was traded) since the small-ball shift. \u201cThey are the team that should scare every coach in the Western Conference playoffs, and I\u2019m including D\u2019Antoni in that group,\u201d a Western Conference executive said. \u201cSeriously, they are a complete wild card right now because we don\u2019t know for sure what they will do the rest of the way [in the regular season]. And what they\u2019ll be like come playoff time is another unknown. \u201cI\u2019ve been around this league enough to know that anyone trying to reinvent the game is bound to deal with some hiccups. And there are no guarantees in the playoffs, none. But they\u2019re on to something right now and if they can get the right matchups in the playoffs \u2026 I guess, as they say, anything is possible.\u201d The confidence Harden and Westbrook regularly operate with ensures they\u2019ll continue to believe they can do the unthinkable, no matter what anyone else says. * * * The Top 5 this week in the 2019-20 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  29.7 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.1 blocks Even when it looks like a team has figured out a way to slow Antetokounmpo down \u2013 as was the case with the Raptors on Tuesday night \u2013 \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d still finds a way to get his work done. He finished with 19 points, 19 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks as the Bucks won in Toronto for their 50th win of the season. The Bucks are running away from the crowd in the standings down the stretch, the same way Antetokounmpo is attempting to in the MVP chase. Last week: No. 2 Season stats :  25.5 points, 7.7 rebounds, 10.6 assists, 1.2 steals A sore groin kept LeBron in street clothes for Thursday\u2019s game against the Golden State Warriors. He made his point earlier in the week anyway, dropping a season-high 40 points (along with eight rebounds, six assists and a block) on the New Orleans Pelicans in his first matchup with Zion Williamson, the heir apparent to his throne as the league\u2019s biggest physical mismatch at his position. Last week: No. 5 Season stats:  35.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.7 steals Harden flirted with that 40-point scoring average for so long earlier this season that he spoiled everyone with his relentless pursuit. But what might be even more impressive is the transition he\u2019s made during this season, adjusting to the small-ball attack and continuing to make defenses miserable trying to contain him. Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.8 steals The Clippers have new additions to integrate into the rotation in Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson, but the onus for this team\u2019s fate are planted firmly on Leonard\u2019s broad shoulders. Things look good so far, though, with Leonard in a nice groove (24 points and 14 rebounds in a win Wednesday against Phoenix ) and the newbies filling their roles perfectly (Jackson and Morris both nailed critical 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of that game). Last week: No. 4 Season stats:  28.7 points, 9.6 rebounds, 8.7 assists, 1.0 steals Doncic celebrated his 21st birthday early and in style, collecting his 21st triple-double in a win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday. Doncic needed just 119 career games to tie the Mavs\u2019 triple-double franchise record that Jason Kidd set in 500 career games. It\u2019s just the latest sign that Doncic is on a career trajectory that suggests he\u2019ll win an MVP (and other accolades, too) someday. * * * * * * 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 7.

Charania went on to describe Embiid\u2019s progress as \u2018symptom-based\u2019 and both mentioned a re-evaluation is coming in a week\u2019s time. The Sixers played without Embiid and guard Ben Simmons in Thursday\u2019s game against the New York Knicks, a game Philadelphia won 115-106 .  Before the game, Sixers coach Brown discussed playing without Embiid and Simmons. \u201cIt\u2019s a painfully obvious bind,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re missing two All-Stars. You yank that from the team and it\u2019s painful.\u201d The duo\u2019s absence didn\u2019t hurt against the woeful Knicks. Tobias Harris stepped up to score 34 points, while Shake Milton added 19 points and Al Horford chipped in with 15 for the 76ers, who improved to an NBA-best 28-2 at home. Harris signed a five-year, $180 million deal in the offseason. He usually takes a back seat offensively to Embiid or Simmons, but Philadelphia needed him to be the go-to player against New York. \u201cJust taking the opportunities that were presented,\u201d said Harris, who added seven rebounds and seven assists. \u201cWe had a good pop to our offense and I was able to get in-the-flow plays.\u201d Harris had 23 points in the opening half to help Philadelphia to a 61-46 lead at the break. Milton went 4-for-4 from the field including three 3-pointers in the first half. Embiid sat for the 17th time this season due to injury or suspension. Simmons missed his third game.

How high will they rise?","content":" The calendar now flips toward March, and the playoffs are in sight , participants looking all but locked with two-thirds of a season in the rearview. But hold on a minute: Here come Zion Williamson and the New Orleans Pelicans to inject a little unpredictability. Yes, the teenager with the linebacker\u2019s body and a team left for dead are suddenly the best bet to divert attention away from March Madness and toward the final playoff spot in the West. After missing the first 44 games following arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in October \u2014 and the club pumping the brake pedal during rehab \u2014 Zion is finally on a first-name basis, looking very much like a franchise player in the making. Once he gets to the rim and winds up, which is often, defenders are advised to wear hard hats. And while his dunks are indeed ferocious, his touch in the paint can also be a grandmother\u2019s kiss. All of this restless energy and production is beginning to announce his arrival, and what\u2019s amazing is that a player on a minutes restriction still hasn\u2019t been fully unleashed. \u201cWhat Zion is doing is amazing,\u201d said Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday, speaking for all of New Orleans, \u201cand we\u2019re waiting to see what comes next.\u201d If the basketball gods are feeling guilty about punishing him with that early injury and willing to make things right, then Zion will win Kia Rookie of the Year despite his abbreviated schedule and the Pelicans will snatch the No. 8 playoff spot. That would give the basketball world what it wants: a first-round TV ratings-buster against LeBron James and the Lakers. Both are hopeful scenarios bordering on realistic because the circumstances are finally in favor of New Orleans. After losing six of seven games to start the season and then taking lumps during a 13-game losing streak in December, the Pelicans are 19-11 since . Much had to do with Brandon Ingram developing into an All-Star, but lately he has qualified as the team\u2019s second-best player \u2014 which most expected to happen eventually, but not this soon. From the moment Williamson stepped on the floor for his Jan. 22 debut, Zion has impacted most games and been the difference in more than a handful. \u201cI missed the first half [of the season], but it\u2019s fun to get out there and be with my teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. I\u2019m just trying to get better at everything.\u201d Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 hold on the final playoff spot is greasy. Jaren Jackson Jr. has an achy knee and will be re-evaluated in a few weeks. Likewise, Brandon Clarke has a quad strain and needs a few weeks off at least. Those are two crucial members of the youthful core that juiced Memphis all season and accelerated the club\u2019s rebuilding process. The Grizzlies also have a difficult remaining schedule , while the Pelicans own the easiest one. March, for New Orleans, brings two games each with Minnesota, Atlanta and Sacramento, with the Knicks and Magic tossed in for comfort. There\u2019s also a pair of Pelicans vs. Grizzlies games that could prove decisive. Essentially, these are two teams trending in opposite directions \u2014 one is healthy and peppered with proven veterans who bring experience in big games, the other is reeling. The Pelicans are three games back with 14 to play with the Portland Trail Blazers and San Antonio Spurs also in the hunt. Then there\u2019s the matter of the Rookie of the Year award, which was all but shipped to Ja Morant by Christmas, although now, there\u2019s an interesting twist. If Zion stays on his current pace and the Pelicans take the last playoff spot from Morant and the Grizzlies, wouldn\u2019t that give voters reason to reconsider? There are no \u201crules\u201d or fine print that says a player must meet a minimum number of games to be considered for a major award. The NBA just issues the ballots and lets voters use their own criteria. Back in 1985, Patrick Ewing was ROY even though he played just 50 games. What\u2019s the cut-off, if any? \u201cLook,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, \u201che\u2019s already one of the 10 best players in the West and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that. The number of games that he missed is probably a factor, but I do think he can make a strong case for himself if we continue to play at a high level and end up in the playoffs \u2014 even after he missed half a season. You can see the impact he\u2019s had on our team. If you go back and add those missed games to the mix, we\u2019re not even having a conversation.\u201d Another member of the Pelicans organization said: \u201cEven with those missed games, if we had to do the draft all over again, we take Zion. If Memphis had the draft all over again and they had the first pick, who you think they\u2019re taking?\u201d Zion is already famous for his grin, and that\u2019s all you get on this and other Zion-flavored subjects. He has kept his interviews to a minimum and says little about himself. In the age of branding and chest-thumping, this No. 1 overall pick is a refreshing shift. \u201cThis kid doesn\u2019t care about all that,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cHe\u2019s all about the team. He just wants to be one of the guys and do everything he can to help us win games. It\u2019s never about him, he doesn\u2019t want it to be about him. That\u2019s not who he is.\u201d The Pelicans are taking it easy with Zion by using a short leash, which only makes his performances all the more impressive. He\u2019s averaging 23.3 points and 7.1 rebounds in just 28.4 minutes per game. That\u2019s an astounding amount of force crammed into a small sample size. Even better for the Pelicans, they\u2019re already giving him the ball in big moments, proof that Zion has rapidly won over the team. \u201cHis defense will come along, too,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWith most young players that\u2019s the main thing, getting better defensively. It\u2019s a fast-paced game and the defensive part is where they have to make improvements. But there\u2019s so much to like. He\u2019s a willing passer and will continue to get a feel for what we\u2019re doing. Everything is a natural maturation process.\u201d This Sunday brings a rematch against LeBron and the Lakers. In their first meeting on Feb. 25, Williamson scored 29 points. He has racked up at least 20 points in 11 of his 13 games and is the first rookie since Michael Jordan to score 20 in eight of his first 10 games. There are no doubters in the locker room. \u201cHe\u2019s probably exceeded expectations,\u201d said guard JJ Redick. \u201cHe\u2019s just incredibly efficient. He just has a high level impact when he steps on the floor. I\u2019m not surprised about the impact but how consistent it\u2019s been, which is obviously rare for a 19-year-old. Got a good head on his shoulders too, doesn\u2019t seem too affected by all the hype around him.\u201d Williamson scores most of his buckets in the paint \u2014 very 1980-ish \u2014 even as he\u2019s shooting 41.7% from 3-point range. Listed at 285 pounds, he\u2019s blessed with a body that goes wide and quickness that you normally see from players 100 pounds lighter. Williamson also wields crafty low-post skills. He is a nightmare matchup. \u201cWhat he brings to the table, efficiency and energy and being able to do that with such force,\u201d said Holiday, \u201cyou just don\u2019t see that from a lot of players. With Zion coming back, it eases the load for Brandon. Zion is out there taking balls from people, bringing energy in the building with those dunks and all the other things that he does.\u201d Jumpers can be classified into two categories: Those with vertical lift and those who are quick. Even with a Duke-record-shattering 45-inch vertical, Zion recovers remarkably, which allows him to collect his own missed shots for putbacks. Of course, those forceful jumps are also viewed skeptically by those who believe Zion is more prone to injury because of them. The Pelicans monitor him differently than most players and the organization places its trust in its medical and performance staff, now considered one of the league\u2019s best after a change in command. The Pelicans, for now, will continue to limit Williamson to 28 mpg, but that will change at some point. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a position of thinking long-term with him,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe want to be able to have him for 15 years.\u201d But first, the Pelicans are concerned about the next 14 games. During the holidays, they were eyeballing the West\u2019s basement. Now, they can envision playing games in late April. With Ingram breaking out, the Pelicans brushed aside their early troubles and kept themselves in the mix while Zion rehabbed, and this is their reward. \u201cOur group never splintered or fractured,\u201d Redick said. \u201cAs we get closer to the end of the season, there\u2019s definitely a feeling of more meaning to every game. We\u2019re still in a hole we dug ourselves. We still have work to do but there\u2019s a feeling of meaning and purpose.\u201d Meaning and purpose? You can see that every time Zion gets the ball in the sweet spot of the paint. The rookie is better late than never, and rather than bemoaning what could\u2019ve been were he been healthy from the start, the Pelicans are weighing the possibilities that lie ahead. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Embiid collided with Cavaliers center Ante Zizic while being fouled late in the first quarter. The 7-footer held his shoulder in obvious pain but stayed in the game and missed both free throws. The Sixers pulled Embiid at the next time stoppage and he walked to the locker room while rubbing his shoulder. He briefly returned to the bench in the second quarter, but went back for more evaluation and treatment. At halftime, Embiid rejoined his teammates on the bench with a wrap on his injured shoulder. Embiid will undergo an MRI exam Thursday to determine the extent of his left shoulder injury, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer \u2018s Keith Pompey. Embiid will miss the Sixers\u2019 game tonight against the New York Knicks ( 7 ET, League Pass ) because of the injury. Embiid had his left arm in a sling and was in visible discomfort following the game. He declined to talk to reporters and had an equipment manager carry his backpack out of the locker room, where the quiet atmosphere summed up the team\u2019s mood. The Sixers are fifth in the conference. Coach Brett Brown said he didn\u2019t know how long Embiid, who scored a career-high 49 points Monday against Atlanta, will be sidelined. \u201cI\u2019m really unsure,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s not coach-speak, but this is part of the NBA landscape. That\u2019s why you try to accumulate talent and depth.\u201d Al Horford said his team had a difficult time adjusting without Embiid, who averages 23.8 points and 12 rebounds. \u201cObviously, we play through him and once he was out, we didn\u2019t really know what was next,\u201d said Horford, who scored 10 points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t quite know how to play. We have to figure out how to play without him.\u201d On Monday night, Embiid scored a career-high 49 points against Atlanta. He\u2019s averaging 23.8 points and 12 rebounds. His injury comes as the Sixers are preparing to play an indefinite period without Simmons, who missed his second straight game because of a nerve impingement in his lower back. The team hasn\u2019t given a timeline on when Simmons will be back. After facing the Cavs and the New York Knicks on Thursday, Philadelphia will begin a four-game road trip in Los Angeles on Sunday. The Sixers have struggled this season away from home, where they are 27-2.

His 12 older siblings played, and as soon as he was able, he picked up the sport too. But growing up, Izzy says, \u201cI was the kid who didn\u2019t get the ball.\u201d After the Pennsylvania native, who was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and mild cerebral palsy, started high school, he began playing with Special Olympics. Today at 22, Izzy makes sure all his teammates are involved in the game. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m the kid who starts with the ball and finds the best way for the team to get it in the basket.\u201d Izzy, who studies Veterinary Technology at a community college, was one of 12 Special Olympics athletes from four countries who played in the 9th annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Sports\u00ae Basketball Game during NBA All-Star weekend. They took the court alongside nine WNBA and NBA legends and current players in a game that \u201cshowcases the power of inclusion through sports,\u201d says Tara Baker, Director of Marketing and Communications with Special Olympics, a global organization for people who have intellectual disabilities . Basketball is one of the most popular sports among Special Olympics athletes. \u201cBasketball, because you have to work as a team and communicate on the court, really lends itself for people with and without intellectual disabilities to partner on the court and compete and have a great experience,\u201d says Baker.  The relationship between the NBA and Special Olympics dates back 45 years, not long after Special Olympics formed in 1968. The Unified Sports game debuted at the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend and it \u201chighlights the values of inclusion, hard work, respect and teamwork that is the foundation of our longstanding partnership with Special Olympics,\u201d says Todd Jacobson, NBA Senior Vice President of Social Responsibility. \u201cThis year\u2019s game was incredible.\u201d When Izzy entered the game, he sparked the Home team with his passes and energy and his team raced to a 31-16 halftime lead. One of his teammates was Jasmine Burnham, an 18-year-old high school senior from Florida. She started playing when she was 5. \u201cMy favorite part is defense,\u201d says Jasmine, who has Treacher-Collins syndrome, a genetic disorder. \u201cI\u2019m aggressive and playing basketball helps release my stress. But it\u2019s also a lot of fun.\u201d Sure enough, Jasmine is all over the court, at one point bodying up NBA legend Muggsy Bogues when he tries to drive the lane. On the bench, she chats up teammate Cheyenne Parker of the Chicago Sky, and during a break, she makes several attempts to high five NBA legend Dikembe Mutombo, who raises his hand as high as possible. Jasmine eventually settles for slapping his inner forearm. \u201cAt the NBA, we believe that everyone has a gift or talent,\u201d says Mutombo, a Special Olympics and NBA Global Ambassador. \u201cPlaying basketball is unifying, and this game is a lot of fun for everyone.\u201d  Jasmine and Izzy\u2019s team gives up their entire halftime lead but eventually pulls out a 44-43 victory that has the crowd cheering. Afterward, the players and legends hug and high five each other before gathering at half court for photos. The next morning, they participate in the NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Basketball Clinic. The players agreed the memories they created during All-Star Weekend will stay with them. \u201cIt was exciting. I was very honored to have the chance of not only meeting people that I grew up watching but to play with and against them,\u201d says Izzy, who finished with 8 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals. \u201cGrowing up, I played with a lot of kids that never gave up the ball because they wanted to be the hero.

There\u2019s another rookie breaking out in a big way. That would be Chicago\u2019s Coby White, who is on a tear of epic proportions. White scored a career-high 35 points on Tuesday to become the first rookie in NBA history to score 30-plus in three straight games while coming off the bench. The North Carolina product also became the first rookie ever to make five or more 3s in three straight games and joined Michael Jordan as the only Bulls rookies with three straight 30-plus games. Any time you\u2019re in a conversation with Jordan, you know you\u2019re doing something right. \u201cHe\u2019s coming into his own,\u201d backcourt mate Zach LaVine said . \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said this from day one, he\u2019s special. He can score the ball like no other. He\u2019s continuing to get better. He\u2019s 20 years old, I think he\u2019s starting to find his groove right now.\u201d White, whom the Bulls took with the 7th pick last summer, is the only lottery pick yet to start a game this season, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from finding his role for the Bulls. Even with his recent hot stretch, coach Jim Boylen says he\u2019s not looking to insert the 6-foot-4 guard into the starting lineup. \u201cI keep getting this question and I\u2019m just going to answer it one more time,\u201d Boylen said . \u201cCoby\u2019s in a good place. We\u2019re going to keep him in a good place. Let\u2019s let Coby keep playing and let\u2019s let him keep developing.\u201d White\u2019s definitely in a good place, and the Bulls are getting a good glimpse of what he\u2019ll bring for years to come, even if it\u2019s off the bench. * * * Last edition: No. 1 Morant is in danger of losing the top rung, but his body of work makes up for what has been a tough start to the second half of the season. The Grizzlies are 0-4 since the break, and Morant hasn\u2019t exactly come out firing. He\u2019s 1-for-8 on 3s in those four games with 15 turnovers (to 15 assists) and is a -12.5 as Memphis\u2019 playoff hopes have taken a big hit. Three of those losses were to West contenders (LAL, LAC, HOU), but now is the time for Morant to step up if the Grizzlies are going to be serious playoff contenders. Last edition: No. 2 No one is playing better basketball than Zion right now, but Morant keeps the top rung thanks to his consistency and not missing time. In three games since the break, Williamson is averaging 27.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists while shooting 56.4% from the field. He\u2019s must-watch TV right now, and only seems to be getting better as he figures out what he can and can\u2019t do (which isn\u2019t much) on the court. After putting up 29 points in his first matchup with LeBron James, the Lakers\u2019 star called Zion \u201cspecial\u201d and left impressed by the future of the league. \u201dHe\u2019s playing exceptional basketball,\u201d James said. \u201dI think his game is going to get better and better, just having that experience. I think today\u2019s game is the perfect fit for his game. The high pace, the way they play, it fits his game. \u2026 It works perfectly, and our game is so many possessions now, so much space, it\u2019s perfect for his game, so he\u2019s doing exceptionally well with that.\u201d 3. Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat   Last edition: No. 5 The Heat are in a tailspin, having lost seven of their last nine. But Nunn has returned from the All-Star break with renewed confidence. In four games, Nunn has averaged 20.8 points and 5.0 assists while shooting 52.6% from the field (41.7% on 3s). Nunn gives a little credit to the Rising Stars game, in which he scored 16 points on 7-for-11 shooting to help Team USA beat Team World 151-131. \u201cIt definitely was a game where I just wanted to go out there and have some fun,\u201d Nunn said . \u201cBut I definitely saw the ball going through the basket and I got back into my rhythm and got into the flow of the game. So it helped.\u201d Last edition: Not ranked White has definitely struggled with consistency all season, but this hot streak hasn\u2019t come out of nowhere. White gave us an early taste, topping 26 points three times in his first eight NBA games (earning him some early love on the Ladder). But this post-All-Star hot streak is like nothing he\u2019s done so far. In the four games since the break, White is averaging 28.3 points while shooting 52.8% from the field (50% on 3s) and hitting 90.5% from the line, where\u2019s he\u2019s seen a big uptick (5.3 FTA\/game). 5. Rui Hachimura, Washington Wizards   Last edition: No. 3 Hachimura has scored in double-digits in all four games since the break, averaging 14.0 points and 5.8 rebounds on 48.8% shooting (4-for-8 on 3s). Bradley Beal has drawn all the headlines with his scorching streak, but Hachimura is proving his worth \u2014 and not just on the court. The league announced this week that Hachimura, the first Japanese player to be drafted, has the top-selling jersey in Japan , beating out superstars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry, and accounting for 24% of all jersey sales in the country. If Hachimura can continue to improve like he has in his rookie campaign, that number will certainly rise.

Sixers await word on Embiid The Philadelphia 76ers just can\u2019t seem to catch a break these days. First, they lost All-Star guard Ben Simmons for about two weeks to a back injury . Then came last night in Cleveland, when All-Star center Joel Embiid played just 7 minutes before suffering a left shoulder injury . Oh, and they also lost that game, too, which made it seven straight road losses for the Sixers. Embiid is reportedly set to have an MRI today and how long he\u2019s out could make Philadelphia\u2019s immediate future look even more dire. 2. Blazers, Pacers ready to move on Indiana and Portland have to be glad that February is just about over for them, especially after they struggled through the month (the Pacers are 3-7 so far; the Blazers are 4-6). They meet tonight in Indiana ( 8 ET, TNT ) and both teams, standings-wise, can still change their fortunes in March. The Pacers are two games behind the No. 4-seeded Miami Heat, while the Blazers are 2 1\/2 games behind the Grizzlies for No. 8 in the West. As the season enters its final month, the Pacers hope to figure out their depth chart after losing Jeremy Lamb for the season. As for the Blazers, a road trip through the East will prove critical to their playoff hopes. 3. Thunder keeping pressure on Rockets Thanks to Utah\u2019s skid and its own four-game win streak, Oklahoma City is No. 5 in the West and within striking distance of No. 4 Houston. The Thunder visit the Kings next ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and are two games behind the Rockets in the standings entering tonight. The Thunder are 18-7 in 2020 and while All-Star Chris Paul remains solid, don\u2019t overlook the play of Danilo Gallinari and Dennis Schroder as well. Since Jan. 1 , Gallinari (20.5 ppg) and Schroder (19.9 ppg) are providing the offense, with Schroder\u2019s scoring average ranking fourth among all reserves. 4. Caruso chipping in for Lakers It is tempting to paint Lakers backup guard Alex Caruso as nothing more than the fan-favorite he is. But do so at your own peril as he has been one of the more efficient reserves in February. His stats this month (6.7 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 2.0 apg, 1.1 spg) are essentially on par with his season averages, but a look at his advanced stats show he\u2019s second on the team in True Shooting and Effective Field Goal percentage. L.A. is seeking its fifth straight win as it hosts Golden State ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) and Caruso has proven to be valuable throughout this hot streak the Lakers are on. 5. Happy Birthday, James Worthy! The \u201cShowtime\u201d era for the Lakers wouldn\u2019t have been the same without James Worthy filling the lane on fast breaks and coming up big in clutch playoff moments. The Hall of Famer and 1988 NBA Finals MVP turns 59 today and was one of the greatest winners in basketball\u2019s history, winning an NCAA title at North Carolina and three NBA titles as an integral part of the Lakers. He was a seven-time All-Star, made two All-NBA teams and is one of the greatest Lakers of all-time."},{"id":28441,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyle-lowry-villanova-jersey-retirement","date":"2020-02-27","title":"Kyle Lowry's jersey retired by Villanova in halftime ceremony","content":" VILLANOVA, Penn.

When the fussy kids were still shooting hoops, Lowry wrangled them over for a quick picture. \u201cThey listen way better than you did,\u201d Wright cracked. \u201cThey know I don\u2019t play,\u201d said Lowry, whose jersey was retired at halftime. The photo opp still fresh in his mind, Wright smiled as he said, \u201cThat was my favorite part of tonight.\u201d Lowry made plenty of big plays in his two seasons with the Wildcats as one of the early pieces that helped build Wright\u2019s program into a national power. Lowry was flanked by former teammates and called the jersey recognition honor a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d experience that he was able to share with his wife and two young sons. His sons, Karter and Kameron, played with the microphones at a halftime press conference. Lowry played from 2004-2006 when the Wildcats made their first two NCAA Tournament trips of Wright\u2019s young tenure. \u201cFrom the time I got here, he was kind of on that proverbial hot seat,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cNow, he\u2019s never going anywhere and he\u2019s one of the best coaches in the history of college basketball.\u201d Wright has since won two national titles at Villanova and was named the AP Coach of the Decade. Wright has said how Lowry skipped classes and was disruptive at practice, so much so that it got to the point where the feisty guard might not have made it to a second season. Lowry laughed when he recalled his rocky relationship with his coach. \u201cMy freshman year, I was such an immature kid and I didn\u2019t know what to expect, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted or what I could do or what my abilities were off the court,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was, I didn\u2019t know who I was.

What will Beal do next? Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal is personifying what \u201cin the zone\u201d means these days. A look at his shot chart from his last two games shows he\u2019s living in the paint and at the 3-point line, shooting a combined 27-for-43 from those zones. He\u2019s put up back-to-back games of 53 and 55 points, respectively, and of the 114 total shots he\u2019s taken in that span (field goals, 3-pointers and free throws), Beal has made 71 of them. The Nets are up next to try and slow him down ( 7 ET, League Pass ) and that may be unlikely. Beal had 34 in the last Nets-Wizards game and has scored 30 or more in 11 of his last 14 games . 2. Tatum, Brown thriving in Boston As we mentioned in this space yesterday , Celtics forward Jayson Tatum is rolling since the All-Star break (35 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 2.0 apg, 1.7 bpg) and Boston is 2-1 in that span and has won 13 of its last 16 games. He had his way with the Blazers last night and a road game with struggling Utah is looming ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ), but don\u2019t praise him for all that\u2019s going right. His youthful cohort, Jaylen Brown, has been on a surge in February (22 ppg) and has been just as crucial to Boston\u2019s recent success. 3. New challenge awaits Sixers The Philadelphia 76ers want All-Star guard Ben Simmons fully healthy for a playoff push. To get to that point, they\u2019ll reportedly go two weeks without him as he heals up from a back injury . That long road starts with a road game in Cleveland ( 7 ET, League Pass ) in what should have been a great big man matchup. While Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid will suit up, new Cleveland center Andre Drummond will miss the game with a left calf strain . Philly\u2019s road woes are well documented , but it has a chance to change that: five of the Sixers\u2019 next six games are on the road, a place they haven\u2019t won since Jan. 20. 4. Home sweet home for Spurs? In seasons past, the Spurs\u2019 annual \u201cRodeo Road Trip\u201d was a place where bonds were forged and some runs to The Finals were born. That wasn\u2019t the case in the 2020 edition, which saw San Antonio go 2-6 on the trek (after a 1-7 mark on it last season). Despite that face plant, San Antonio is 3 1\/2 games behind No. 8 Memphis in the West standings as a home game against Dallas looms ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ). The Spurs have made the playoffs 22 straight seasons, or to put it a different way: They\u2019ve made the playoffs longer than Mavs star point guard Luka Doncic has been alive (he\u2019ll turn 21 on Friday).  5. Grizzlies, Rockets headed in opposite directions Houston went all-in on small ball and is thriving in it to the tune of four straight wins.

A foot injury that ended his season just as conference games began in early January ensured that. But suffice it to say he had a great head start. Not only was the 6-foot-6 Nesmith unfazed by the NCAA\u2019s longer 3-point line, in the 14 games he played, Nesmith didn\u2019t appear to notice \u2014 or care \u2014 from what distance he shot. Many of the 60 3s he made were from NBA range, and whether he was wide open or had a hand in his face, the result was often the same. On January 10, just before it was announced a stress fracture in his right foot had washed out the remainder of his season, Nesmith led the SEC and the nation in 3-point percentage (52.2%), 3s per game (4.29) and 3-pointers made (60). Nesmith was one of just two players in Division I to have made at least seven or more 3s in a game four times, and he led the league and was fifth in the country in scoring (23.0). If all Nesmith could do was shoot 3s, he\u2019d have been a godsend for first-year coach Jerry Stackhouse, who had inherited a depleted roster from a team that was winless in SEC games last season. But Nesmith had more weapons in his arsenal. \u201cWhen everything doesn\u2019t go as well as we want to within an offensive set,\u201d Stackhouse said after the Commodores\u2019 second game of the season, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a guy that we can put the ball in his hands.\u201d At the time of his injury, Nesmith was also shooting 51.2% from the field, the result of drives to the basket, post-ups, dunks in transition and mid-range floaters. And he was cashing in at the free-throw line (82.5%). Teams had to respect his off-the-bounce game, which made him, at the very least, a tough cover. Often, it seemed as though opponents were powerless to stop him, like the night he tossed in four 3s in a span of 1:39 and scored 34 points against Richmond, or his 28-point, eight 3-pointer night against SMU. Given that scintillating start, anyone with a modicum of interest in the Vanderbilt program wondered how far Nesmith could take it this season, and whether, playing against consistently tougher SEC competition, teams could have game-planned to stop him, or at least slow him down. One can only speculate now, but Nesmith\u2019s freshman statistics offer a hint Nesmith could have kept on going. In 2018-19, Nesmith averaged 11.0 points and shot 33.7% from 3. In SEC games only, he averaged 13.5 points and shot 34.2% from behind the arc. He racked up 14 double-figure scoring games in the league \u2014 which many experts would say was more talented than it is this season \u2014 including four 20-point games. That latter total included a 26-point game against Florida, a 24-point, 14-rebound effort against an Auburn team that went on to play in the Final Four, 24 against Tennessee and 23 against South Carolina. In the only SEC game Nesmith played this season before the foot injured sidelined him, he scored 18 points and made 4-for-6 3-pointers against Auburn. Clearly, the step up in competition didn\u2019t slow Nesmith. And one person who knows him as well as anyone thinks Nesmith would have ripped up the SEC, just like he did Vanderbilt\u2019s non-conference opponents. \u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Tennessee freshman guard Josiah Jordan James says, matter of factly. \u201c[SEC competition] probably would have elevated his game even more. I know the hard work he had put in over the summer and preseason. I knew how dialed in he was, just talking to him. He knew what he had to do for his team.\u201d James, a five-star point guard, and Nesmith have some history. They combined to help Porter-Gaud School in Charleston, South Carolina win three consecutive AAA state championships from 2016-18. James was able to see on a daily basis the competitive nature and the work ethic of his teammate. \u201cHis game is ever-evolving,\u201d James says. \u201cHe\u2019s working on every aspect of it. Like before this season, his level of focus going into workouts \u2026 just knowing the areas he had to improve, like ball handling and defense. He\u2019s always been a great shooter. And now he\u2019s taken steps to work on other areas.\u201d Vanderbilt associate head coach David Grace worked in the Pac-12 when Klay Thompson played in that league and saw other high-level athletes during a five-year stint at UCLA. Grace isn\u2019t afraid to compare Nesmith to Thompson. And he\u2019s convinced Nesmith\u2019s pre-conference numbers foreshadowed what was to come in the SEC. \u201cHe would have been tough to deal with in the league as well,\u201d Grace says. \u201cHe garnered so much [defensive] attention yet he still got his points within the system. Coach Stackhouse\u2019s system fit him perfectly. We were in awe when the kid missed a shot. And he could dunk on people. You definitely had your hands full if you were guarding him.\u201d Nesmith\u2019s hot start to this season wasn\u2019t an accident. He was thrilled when Vanderbilt hired Stackhouse. \u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d Nesmith says. \u201cNBA veteran who was in the league for 18 years. Plays my position. Does what I do. Loved to put the ball in the basket. Going to outwork the guy next to him. Tough. Perfect for me.\u201d Nesmith knew he was going to be a focal point in the offense, so he took the unusual step of deconstructing what was always a reliable stroke because he didn\u2019t think he shot the ball well enough as a freshman. After breaking it all down, Nesmith built it back up, piece by piece. And then he went to work, hoisting thousands of shots. Even after practices, he wouldn\u2019t leave the gym until he tossed up 150 3-pointers. \u201cBefore the season, I told my trainer and my coaches \u2014 everybody, really \u2014 that was I was going to be the best shooter in college basketball,\u201d Nesmith says. \u201cYou watch me.\u201d Nesmith was well on his way. Then one day he was awakened from an afternoon nap by Vanderbilt\u2019s trainer, who told him he had a stress fracture in his foot. Nesmith had been experiencing discomfort, not pain, most of the season, but doctors thought it was a high ankle sprain. When an MRI revealed the truth, Nesmith was devastated, but typical of the work ethic his parents instilled in him, he\u2019s not going to let that interfere with his dreams of becoming a first-round NBA Draft pick. Most mock drafts have already anointed him as such. \u201cI\u2019m just going to attack the rehab process every day,\u201d Nesmith says. \u201cAnd every day, I want to be one percent better than I was the day before.\u201d Vanderbilt fans can only wonder what might have been had Nesmith stayed healthy. For the record, the SEC\u2019s gold standard for 3s in a season was set in 2018-19 by Auburn\u2019s Bryce Brown (141). Kentucky guard Travis Ford shot 52.9% from 3 in 1993, a percentage that has held up ever since. Asked whether those records were in danger, and whether he could have kept up his onslaught against SEC opponents, Nesmith doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d he says. \u201cI know I could have kept it up just from a confidence standpoint. My confidence was at an all-time high after all my preparation and shot work. It became so second nature, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind I could keep it up.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

But don\u2019t tell Bradley Beal that there\u2019s nothing left to play for this season. Beal lit the Milwaukee Bucks up for a career-high 55 points Monday night, becoming the first player since Kobe Bryant (in 2007) to score 50 or more points in back-to-back games . He blasted the Chicago Bulls for 53 points a day earlier. On a day when Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and seven others were honored in a memorial service at Staples Center , Beal unleashed his \u201cMamba Mentality\u201d on the best team in the league. Beal\u2019s work, in losing efforts, highlights the enigmatic nature of his season. As good as he\u2019s been, it\u2019s tough for Beal to revel in his accomplishments while the Wizards struggle. \u201cI\u2019m a winner,\u201d Beal said, \u201cso you can throw those 55 out with the last 53.\u201d It also makes it extremely difficult to appreciate the full scope of what it takes to score the way Beal has all season, hence his absence on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder . Despite all his feats, Beal wasn\u2019t an All-Star and will be hard-pressed to earn an All-NBA spot given the competition for those spots this season. Bully ball from \u2018The Process\u2019: Joel Embiid\u2019s talent is undeniable. And when he has a chance to impose his will against an opponent incapable of handling it, there\u2019s an opportunity to view the Embiid that was on display Monday. He was at his efficient best against Atlanta (which, in its defense, was missing Clint Capela), bullying his way to a career-high 49 points (as well as 14 rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block) to power a win. He did so without All-Star counterpart Ben Simmons (who missed the game with a back injury). Embiid expressed himself in ways both good and bad (see his late-game gesture directed at Kevin Huerter), before reiterating that he feels like he\u2019s \u201cthe best player in the world.\u201d It\u2019s still hard to know what the Sixers will be come playoff time. But it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ll go as far as Embiid takes them. The Real MVP : The Bryant memorial was an emotional ride for all involved, both in the sold-out, star-studded crowd at Staples Center as well as for the millions watching from afar. If you missed it, take time today and review the celebration yourself. Seeing Michael Jordan and so many others shed tears had to take you there. But to see Vanessa Bryant stand as strong as she did in articulating her thoughts and feelings about both her husband and their daughter was something to behold. She\u2019s the real MVP. * * * Now, let\u2019s get into your emails about the  Kia MVP Ladder . * * * From:  Myrna Camar Feb. 23, 2020 | 3:04 p.m. In your latest rankings, Trae Young is in your cluster after the top 10 players. Why is this considering that his team is still near the bottom? Is it because of his scoring and assist numbers? His individual record has not translated to team wins. * * * My response:  Trae has been relegated to the sidelines on the Ladder because of those things you mentioned. The Hawks\u2019 inability to win games with their All-Star point guard doing all that he does is why Trae can\u2019t play his way into the top 10. You seem surprised that he\u2019s on the list at all, while others cannot understand why he isn\u2019t mentioned in the top five like Luka Doncic. I say it all the time: the great separator on the Ladder is the impact a player has on his team\u2019s bottom line. Winning matters. From: Can Dartan Feb. 23, 2020 | 2:08 p.m. I apologize if I am being too direct but I really don\u2019t understand how you put LeBron on this list. He is not even the best player on his team. Anthony Davis leads the Lakers in points, rebounds, blocks and steals. Actually, he is the one who deserves to be on this list and putting Harden at No. 5 is just disrespectful. I think you are very biased. I am very very disappointed in you. * * * My response: Can, I apologize for the direct response, but I cannot fathom how anyone could dismiss what LeBron is doing this season after watching five minutes of the Lakers. You cannot be serious trying to poke holes in his game 17 years in. You talk about being disappointed, some of the stuff I see on a regular basis like this is what\u2019s really disappointing. Put aside your love for whoever your favorite player is and at least show a little respect for the other elite players in the MVP mix. From: StreetPrice President Feb. 22, 2020 | 3:10 p.m. You had Westbrook at No. 10 on your last MVP ranking before the break. I took a look at your ladder today and Russ is not even listed! * * * My response: I wish I had a better response for you, because Russ has been outstanding. But it\u2019s just an extremely tough list to make. And it\u2019s even tougher when you have someone else on your team with just as strong of a case (or stronger) than you. From: Asher White Feb. 21, 2020 | 9:44 p.m. I just wanted to tell you that I think LeBron should be in first place over Giannis. I think that this would be correct because he is 35 and still putting up amazing numbers. He is averaging a career high in assists and he make everyone that he plays with better. LeBron is competing against players who are younger and have way more time left in their careers. He is doing so many great things and he is leading the Lakers to a great season. In the few months that he has played with this revamped Lakers team, he has created great chemistry with all the players especially AD. * * * My response: Thank you, Asher. It\u2019s always good to hear from the next generation hoops lovers. And you make great points about LeBron and the chemistry that\u2019s been cultivated on this Lakers team. It\u2019s a complete flip in that department from the dysfunction that ripped the Lakers\u2019 season apart a year ago. From: Hollis Pettway Feb. 21, 2020 | 7:48 p.m. The points you outlined are really helpful in understanding how the MVP winner is chosen. I was listening to the guys on TNT a few days ago when Shaq said \u201cJames Harden does not pass the ball\u201d \u2026 in spite of his career assist average and his current average of 7.3 assists per game. Last night, after Harden got 10 assists in a rout of Golden State, the TNT crew was yammering that they would double team the guy, even if it meant letting him score 50. They go on and on complaining about the small-ball concept, even when it works. What is it with these guys? Are they so obsessed with the way they used to play that they can\u2019t conceive of nuance? For the record, I don\u2019t generally watch their commentary, but I listened in last night and it only confirmed why I don\u2019t watch them. * * * My response:  First things first, Hollis: be nice to my guys on \u201cInside The NBA.\u201d They are the best in the business, by far. And I appreciate them telling us what they really think as opposed to any alternative. They don\u2019t play the narrative game that many of us in the media tend to in regards to these things. You have every right to disagree with them. But don\u2019t tune them out. From: Alex Radovanovich Feb. 21, 2020 | 4:28 p.m. All these players who show up on your list are putting up unbelievable numbers \u2014 its amazing what some of these guys do. I think that it wouldn\u2019t be unfair to give the MVP trophy to any of your top 5 guys. So, I think it comes down to this: where will their teams finish in the standings? To me it is almost obvious that Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to get another MVP. I don\u2019t think LeBron James or James Harden will get it. Why? First off, I really don\u2019t believe in Rockets. When it comes to LeBron, I think that he is going to save his energy for playoffs. It is possible for him to get it, but i just don\u2019t think that either he is interested in it and I don\u2019t think the Lakers are going to have better record than the Bucks at season\u2019s end. I give a chance to Kawhi Leonard and Luka Doncic if Leonard\u2019s LA Clippers can finish first in the West or if Doncic\u2019s Dallas Mavericks can get in a really good rhythm and finish top 3 in the West. Here\u2019s my list based on how I think things are going to wind up at the end of the season: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Not a lot to say about that. 2. Kawhi Leonard. If Clippers grab the No. 1 seed in the West, I think he\u2019s the MVP 3. LeBron James. This is the lowest I can put LBJ. Things he does are amazing! 4. Luka Doncic. I believe if the Mavs get close to the West\u2019s top spot, Luka\u2019s chances are going up fast. 5. James Harden. I hope things get heated up and we see an interesting fight for the MVP this year! * * * My response:  Things could definitely get more interesting down the stretch if the top five guys stay healthy and continue to blow us away with the way they\u2019ve played. Sustaining an elite level of play is more difficult than people realize. Making that top five at the end of a season means you found the sweet spot that only the best of the very best could find. From: David Rosen Feb. 21, 2020 | 12:55 p.m. I have enjoyed your Kia MVP Ladder for the past couple of months since I was on the mailbag. I love where you have everyone on the ladder, but I think you should have a 1A and 1B when it comes to Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James. They have been equally as valuable to their teams and the value is translating into wins. LeBron is leading the NBA in assists and I think he is having one of his best years of his career. Giannis\u2019 team has more wins, but if I had an MVP vote, it would be too hard for me to make a decision right now. * * * My response: You\u2019ve got me thinking now, David. Could we see a split this season that would lend itself to a 1A and 1B scenario? Maybe. We\u2019ve had close MVP finishes in the past, but I never considered it on my own ballot. I like making the hard choice when it\u2019s all said and done. From: Rishi Roy Feb. 20, 2020 | 4:13 p.m. I think there are many players who deserve to win the MVP and many players that are underrated or overrated. So far this season, the Milwaukee Bucks are doing good and have an incredible record. The Celtics and Raptors are also doing good and have many MVP-worthy players. Giannis Antetokounmpo is doing well statistics-wise and he contributes to his team. Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum are also doing good as well and so are Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam. The West also brings exciting players to the table like LeBron James, Anthony Davis, James Harden Luka Doncic and more. LeBron brings style to basketball, but is doing the same thing he\u2019s done the past 10 years so he isn\u2019t as good as I thought. Harden is also doing well, even though he is struggling the past few weeks. Even though Harden is doing well some games and not the others, he is still MVP worthy and might get better next year.  Here\u2019s my MVP list: 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. James Harden 3. Luka Doncic 4. LeBron James 5. Kawhi Leonard * * * My response: I don\u2019t see any overrated players in your top five, Rishi. And they happen to be the same top five on the latest Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. When you get this deep into a season, the fraud candidates have been revealed. We\u2019re in the stretch run of the race and the real ones are still in the mix. I think we all can agree on that. That next five (6-10) is where the real movement comes this time of year. * * * * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Zion vs. LeBron, Part I The Pelicans are 0-2 against the West-leading Los Angeles Lakers this season, but are 0-0 when it comes to New Orleans facing L.A. with Zion Williamson on the court. The Lakers and their MVP favorite, LeBron James , host the Pelicans tonight ( 10 ET, TNT ) as Williamson brings his late-season push for Kia Rookie of the Year to Staples Center. This is the first NBA matchup between the multi-skilled forwards and is one you can\u2019t afford to miss. Both teams come into the game playing well, too, with the Lakers on a five-game win streak and the Pelicans having won seven of their last 10. 2. Bucks, Raptors renew rivalry Hard to believe, perhaps, but the Raptors and Bucks haven\u2019t played each other since Nov. 2 \u2014 a game Milwaukee won 115-105. Since then, both teams have proved to be the class of the Eastern Conference and are ready for their second showdown of 2019-20 ( 7:30 ET, TNT ). The Pascal Siakam vs. Giannis Antetokounmpo matchup entices , of course, but don\u2019t overlook Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry vs. Milwaukee\u2019s defense. Lowry is off to a slow start since the All-Star break , but lit up the Bucks for 36 points in the last matchup, scoring 24 of those points against Donte DiVincenzo, Eric Bledsoe, George Hill and Giannis Antetokounmpo. 3. Thunder closing in on No. 5 spot Oklahoma City has been nothing if not steady all season, never losing more than three games in a row (or winning more than five straight). The Thunder are in the midst of a three-game streak and, coupled with the Utah Jazz\u2019s three-game slide, are 1 game behind them for No. 5 in the West. A trip to Chicago is next ( 8 ET, League Pass ) where the Thunder have to try to cool off Bulls rookie Coby White (33 points in each of his last two games ). This game bears watching because both squads are among the best at scoring in the paint , with OKC often putting the onus for that work on its guards . 4. Can Tatum keep it rolling? Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum was hot in his last game, dropping a career-best 41 points on the Lakers in a narrow loss Sunday.

Beal erupted for 55 points in Monday\u2019s overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Following his 53-point outburst in another defeat, to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday, it marked the second time Beal set his career high in as many games. \u201cOh man, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Beal said after the game. \u201cDidn\u2019t know that. That\u2019s who Kobe was. That was his drive and that ceremony today just brought the feeling, the tears all back again.\u201d In doing so, Beal became the first NBA player to score 50-plus points on consecutive nights since Bryant back in 2007. He is also just the sixth NBA player to ever achieve such a feat, joining Wilt Chamberlain (multiple), Elgin Baylor (1962), Bernard King (1984), Michael Jordan (1987) and Bryant. \u201cI was just locked in and I just was having fun,\u201d said Beal, the first player in franchise history to have back-to-back 50-point games. \u201cProbably the most fun game I\u2019ve ever played in.\u201d Unfortunately for Beal, it marks the first of those instances where both games were losses. Beal\u2019s second straight 50-point outburst bumped his scoring average up by a full half point to 30.1 per game, second in the NBA behind James Harden (35.3). In the loss, Beal (4,071) passed Gus Johnson and Phil Chenier (tied with 4,057) for fourth place all-time in field goals made for the franchise. He has nine games of 40 or more points, tied with Gilbert Arenas for fourth-place all-time for the franchise.

Designed to draw laughter to disrupt the angst and pull sweet memories back to the surface. The memorial of Bryant and his daughter Gianna served up a concoction of emotion, tonic for a heartbroken city and basketball world that still refuses to accept the events of Jan. 26 actually happened. The depth of a person and his life and how much he resonated in the world is sometimes quantified only in death. Then you learn more about him and discover and notice the breadth of his reach. And so, this is what the tragic passing of Bryant and his daughter and their subsequent celebration of life managed to do on Monday, which was symbolically 2-24 on the calendar \u2014 her uniform number and his. It brought tears from surprise guest speaker Michael Jordan, famous for his strength and unbreakable spirit in the most critical of moments, who didn\u2019t reach for a hanky until his shoes were wet. It gave way to performances by Beyonc\u00e9, Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera; that\u2019s 240 million sold records and 44 Grammys worth of voice in your ear. In addition to Jordan, it brought a combined 32 total MVP awards to one room: Tim Duncan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Stephen Curry and LeBron James, even James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who had five hours to fly back to Houston for a game that night. Plus, WNBA stars Candace Parker, Diana Taurasi and the top player in college basketball, Sabrina Ionescu, showing support not only for Kobe but also his daughter. As Geno Auriemma, the women\u2019s coach at Connecticut, put it: \u201cThis is the greatest collection of talent I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d And it measured the courage of Vanessa Bryant, a widow and now a mother of three, who somehow showed her Mamba mentality by standing before a sellout crowd and discussing her losses and managing to hold it together, save for a few understandable cracks and quivers. It was Vanessa who provided private home videos of Kobe the dad shooting hoops with his daughter and on family vacations, and of \u201cGigi\u201d breaking ankles during youth league games. This was Vanessa\u2019s production, her rare venture into the public which she previously preferred to keep to Kobe, her way of revealing how Kobe was more than an NBA star while Gigi was actually your typical 13-year-old, albeit with her father\u2019s blood-thirst on the basketball court. This was her heartfelt \u201cthank you\u201d to scores of Kobe admirers worldwide and especially those in Los Angeles, the ones who elevated him to immortal status and practically adopted Gigi as their own. Generating that amount of star power at a memorial, getting 19,000 fans to take the morning off from work \u2014 and there would\u2019ve been more if this were held at the LA Memorial Coliseum, for instance \u2014 is difficult without touching the lives of so many others across every conceivable cultural line. Anyone who watched the ceremony on TV or was lucky enough to snag the toughest ticket in town surely came away wanting to head to the nearest gym and put up 1,000 shots and then go home and squeeze their loved ones a little tighter than usual. That was the Kobe-inspired motivation for nearly three hours. But really, this was a culmination of an unfathomable month that saw a public outpouring perhaps unprecedented for any athlete, at least in L.A. Kobe gave the city and the Lakers five championships, 20 years of basketball bliss, the numbers 81 and 60 and 8 and 24, countless thrilling individual feats and a work ethic to be admired, if not copied. He made people feel good in their escape from the routine. That, and his fatherly presence around Gigi while teaching her the game and throwing his weight behind women\u2019s sports, and the awfulness of a crash that cut down seven others in their prime, well, it\u2019s just too much, even now. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us could have imagined this,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, who hosted the memorial. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see his face, his number, Gigi\u2019s face, Gigi\u2019s number.\u201d Yes, still. All around, there are Kobe hats and Kobe shirts, Kobe jerseys and Kobe sneakers, Kobe pictured celebrating a big victory and Kobe with his arm around Gigi. Those are the images that run through town, on the sides of buildings, on fresh tattoos, certainly in the heads of many. There had to be as many red roses surrounding the stage at Staples as points scored by Kobe. Everyone is with Kobe and Gianna and the Lakers. That includes Steve Ballmer, owner of the Clippers, who sat among the team Monday. And Jerry West, who left the Lakers organization years ago with frayed feelings, yet returned to honor the player he brilliantly acquired in a draft-day trade when Kobe was 17. And Phil Jackson, the 11-time champion coach and Kobe\u2019s favorite, temporarily halting a reclusive life in Montana. And Celtics great Bill Russell, getting a standing ovation from the House of Lakers for his presence at the memorial and also for wearing a Kobe jersey the day before. Shaq is with Kobe, his teammate for three straight titles. O\u2019Neal admitted their relationship was \u201ccomplex\u201d but compared it to Beatles greats Lennon and McCarthy and said he and Bryant \u201cmade beautiful basketball together.\u201d There was a deep respect between them, and Shaq promised to look after the family and expose the game to Kobe\u2019s other daughters while promising not to \u201cteach them my free throw technique.\u201d Auriemma is with Kobe, revealing how Kobe once picked his brain for tips on coaching Gigi, and then when Auriemma saw Gigi pass up a shot to feed a teammate, said: \u201cShe\u2019s not listening to her father.\u201d Rob Pelinka is with Kobe, his friend and former agent for decades and godfather to Gigi. Now serving as VP of Basketball Operations and General Manager, the Lakers executive revealed that he exchanged texts with Kobe on the helicopter just minutes before the crash, when Kobe sought Pelinka\u2019s help to set up a daughter of John Altobelli, the college baseball coach who perished in the crash, with a baseball internship. \u201cKobe\u2019s last human act,\u201d Pelinka said, \u201cwas heroic.\u201d Joe and Pam Bryant are with Kobe. The parents and the son had an infamously fractured relationship during his NBA career and weren\u2019t in attendance together during some of Kobe\u2019s major moments. Yet father and mother sat in the front row Monday, along with Kobe\u2019s sisters, quashing all suspense. And Jordan is with Kobe. When Kobe first had his first taste of the NBA, he mimicked everything about Jordan by wearing a wristband on the forearm, strutting with a swagger down court, even sticking a tongue out at times. Kobe was bombarded by \u201cwanna-be-Jordan\u201d wisecracks and yet imitation is flattering, even to Jordan, who took a liking to Kobe\u2019s approach to work and desire to win, though not to the phone calls at 2 a.m. and sometimes 3. \u201cAt first it was an aggravation,\u201d Jordan recalled. \u201cThen it turned into passion. This kid had passion like you never knew. He wanted to be the best basketball player he could be. I wanted to be the best big brother that I could be, and to do that you\u2019ve got to take the aggravation, the late night calls and the dumb questions.\u201d There is no chance Kobe\u2019s career would\u2019ve even come close to Jordan\u2019s had he not tried to be as good as Jordan, or even better. Jordan also remembered how he first met Kobe by walking into Phil Jackson\u2019s office, seeing a kid put all protocol aside by saying: \u201cDid you bring your sneakers?\u201d The sight and sound of Jordan sniffling while saying \u201cwhen Kobe died, a piece of me died\u201d was enough to turn your stomach in knots. Then came relief in the form of belly-aching laughter when Jordan, his face soaked, said: \u201cNow he got me \u2026 I\u2019ll have to look at another crying meme.\u201d And everyone is with Gigi. The innocence of an eighth-grader, her life barely started, with so much more to give, connects with everyone who has kids. While her mother lamented that she\u2019ll never see a father-daughter dance at Gigi\u2019s wedding nor have a chance to teach her how to drive, the impact of Gigi already has raised more awareness of youth and women\u2019s sports. It was not by accident that there were as many, if not more, Gigi highlights as Kobe highlights that played Monday on the big screen. Nor was it merely a coincidence that Taurasi, Auriemma and Ionescu were selected to speak. This was as much about a movement within one gender of players as it was another. \u201c(Gianna) would\u2019ve made a huge difference in women\u2019s basketball,\u201d Vanessa Bryant said. Her daughter once asked the nearby high school coach if she could give some pointers to the boy\u2019s team. Her favorite phrase: \u201cI got this.\u201d Mostly, though: \u201cShe was an amazingly sweet and gentle soul. She was always thoughtful. She always kissed me good night and kissed me good morning \u2026 she knew how much her morning and evening kisses meant to me.\u201d As for \u201cKoko,\u201d her pet name for Kobe, Vanessa Bryant mentioned how she had pick-up duties for the kids from school and always arrived an hour early. When Kobe retired, it was his turn, but one day, he arrived late and his family never let him forget it. True to form, Kobe made a point to arrive an hour and 20 minutes early, one-upping his wife. Kobe always looked to see if Vanessa was in her seat at tipoff for home games, and was rattled when she was running late. Her reply: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to drop 81 points within the first 10 minutes of the game.\u201d And with a wife and four daughters, she also said this of her thoughtful man of the house: \u201cHe never left the toilet seat up.\u201d This is the Kobe we didn\u2019t really know, the husband and father belying the sinister expression on the court, the Kobe that everyone close to him is now willing to share because all that\u2019s left are memories. That\u2019s why the Kobe jerseys are in short supply, unlike the \u201cKo-be\u201d chants, which come frequently at Laker games, without warning and certainly without explanation. Eventually if not gradually, normalcy will beckon and take over L.A. and other places that celebrate Kobe. As Jimmy Kimmel said: \u201cEveryone seems to hug each other \u2026 this only seems to happen at church or sporting events.\u201d Of course, there will never be normal anymore in the Bryant household, now minus two. As Vanessa Bryant readies for a new life while taking on an added role, she had one request for a husband and father who just happened to be an 18-time All-Star and former MVP: \u201cBabe, you take care of our Gigi.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Speaking at times through tears, Vanessa Bryant praised her husband\u2019s devotion to their family as she addressed thousands of fans gathered at Staples Center to remember Bryant and 13-year-old Gianna. \u201cGod knew they couldn\u2019t be on this Earth without each other,\u201d Vanessa Bryant said. \u201cHe had to bring them home to have them together. Babe, you take care of our Gigi.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBATV\/status\/1232013672395857922 The service took place at the downtown arena where Bryant played for the Los Angeles Lakers for the final 17 seasons of his two-decade NBA career. Thousands of Lakers fans, many wearing Bryant\u2019s jersey or team colors, attended the tearful gathering to honor Los Angeles\u2019 most popular athlete and a global basketball icon. The ceremony began with Beyonce performing her songs \u201cXO\u201d and \u201cHalo\u201d with dozens of backup musicians. Alicia Keys performed Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d later in the program, and Christina Aguilera sang \u201cAve Maria.\u201d The two-hour program concluded with \u201cDear Basketball,\u201d Bryant\u2019s Academy Award-winning short film. After Jimmy Kimmel welcomed the crowd, Vanessa Bryant remembered the family\u2019s life with Gianna and her three siblings and then eulogized her husband. They had been together since 1999. \u201cHe was the most amazing husband,\u201d she said. \u201cKobe loved me more than I could ever express or put into words. I was fire. He was ice. Vice versa at times. \u2026 He was my everything.\u201d The mourners included Lakers greats such as Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and Pau Gasol. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver joined Michael Jordan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Phil Jackson and dozens of current NBA players, including Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and Los Angeles natives James Harden, Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan. Celebrities such as Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez also attended. Jordan, the Chicago Bulls great whose career was wrapping up as Bryant\u2019s was starting in the late 1990s, praised Bryant as \u201cone of my dear friends. He was like a little brother. \u2026 As I got to know him, I wanted to be the best big brother that I could be.\u201d O\u2019Neal and Bryant joined the Lakers together in 1996, and they won three consecutive championships during eight tumultuous seasons in purple and gold. Although their relationship was often publicly rocky, Shaq said the two were always friendly in private, even comparing their dynamic to John Lennon and Paul McCartney. \u201cKobe and I pushed each other to play some of the greatest basketball of all time,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI\u2019m proud nobody has accomplished what the threepeat Lakers have done since the Shaq and Kobe Lakers did it.\u201d O\u2019Neal also got the biggest laugh in the somber service with a profane joke about an exchange in which Shaq told Kobe there was no \u201cI\u201d in team, but Bryant responded by noting that there is an \u201cM-E.\u201d Vanessa Bryant was followed on the podium by basketball stars Diana Taurasi and Sabrina Ionescu. Kobe Bryant was a passionate advocate for women\u2019s basketball, and Gigi Bryant was a promising young player. \u201cIf I represented the present of the women\u2019s game, Gigi represented the future, and Kobe knew it,\u201d said Ionescu, the Oregon star who was mentored by Bryant. Rob Pelinka, Bryant\u2019s longtime agent before he became the Lakers\u2019 general manager in 2017, referred to the day of the crash as \u201cwhen the axis of the world seemed to shift forever, for all of us.\u201d Pelinka was also Gigi Bryant\u2019s godfather, and the families were close. He also revealed that Bryant had texted him only moments before the crash, asking for help in securing an internship with a baseball agent for teenager Alexis Altobelli, who lost her parents and younger sister in the crash moments later. \u201cKobe lived to make other people\u2019s lives better, all the way up to his final text,\u201d Pelinka said. Among the early arriving fans was Alyssa Shapiro, 27, of Huntington Beach, who said she was inspired to become a basketball player after watching countless Lakers games with her father. The family\u2019s love of the game \u2014 and Bryant\u2019s work in women\u2019s sports \u2014 prompted her to become a middle school girls\u2019 basketball coach. Her team had played Gianna\u2019s team and she would watch Bryant cheer for his daughter in the stands. She said she went up to Bryant to introduce herself at a game. \u201cI just wanted to thank him for being such an inspiration to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up watching him on the screen. \u2026 It made me realize he\u2019s more than just that guy out on the court.\u201d The concourse was a sea of people dressed in the team colors of purple and yellow and others in black. On the scoreboard, the Bryant family\u2019s life flashes by in pictures. The service began just hours after Vanessa Bryant sued the owner of the helicopter that crashed in the fog last month. The wrongful-death lawsuit claimed that the pilot, Ara Zobayan, was careless and negligent by flying in cloudy conditions. At the arena, fans were given a program containing photos, a purple KB pin and a T-shirt with photos of the father and daughter. Money from ticket sales was to be given to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which supports youth sports programs in underserved communities and teaches sports to girls and women. Bryant played his entire 20-year NBA career with the Lakers, who moved from the Forum to Staples Center when it opened in 1999. The five-time NBA champion\u2019s two retired jersey numbers \u2014 8 and 24 \u2014 hang high above the arena where he became the third-leading scorer in league history. Lakers star LeBron James surpassed him on the night before Bryant\u2019s death. Bryant remained one of the most popular figures in Los Angeles well into retirement.

In order to hold onto that spot, the Grizz would have to navigate the league\u2019s toughest and most road-heavy post-break schedule. Well, they\u2019re not off to a good start. Not only did the Grizzlies lose their first tough post-break game (against the Lakers on Friday), they lost their first easy one (against the Kings on Thursday). Meanwhile, the New Orleans Pelicans, the 10th-place team with the league\u2019s easiest post-break schedule , took care of business against Portland and Golden State.

Hopefully that finally changes with this week\u2019s slate of games, starting with Tuesday\u2019s nightcap to a TNT doubleheader in Los Angeles as the Pelicans visit the Lakers ( 10 ET ). Williamson is currently on a tear, having scored 20 points or more in eight consecutive games , which registers as the longest such stretch by a rookie in the NBA this season. James, meanwhile, is coming off back-to-back 30-point nights in which he\u2019s averaged 32 points, 7.5 rebounds and 10.5 assists per game. The Lakers are 17-0 this season when James puts up 30 points, but the Pelicans have won seven of their last eight road games. * * * \u2022 Tuesday, Feb. 25 (10 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Haven\u2019t met yet. Although their teams have met twice this season, this game marks the first time Williamson and James square off. Williamson missed the first two contests \u2014 both Los Angeles wins \u2014 as he recovered from October knee surgery. Since Williamson\u2019s return on Jan. 22, the Pelicans are 8-5, including wins in five of their last six games. Going into what should be a physical contest between these teams, keep in mind that James, 35, ranks in the top 10 in usage rate. Williamson, 19, became the youngest player in NBA history last week to score 20 points or more in seven consecutive outings. \u2022 Tuesday, Feb. 25 (7:30 ET, TNT) Last regular season meeting: Nov. 2, 2019. Antetokounmpo outdueled the self-declared \u201cbest player in the world\u201d on Saturday in Joel Embiid, and faces another formidable foe in Siakam, who owns a postseason record of 4-2 against the Bucks star. Antetokounmpo racked up 36 points, 15 rebounds (13 on defense) and eight assists in his last game against Siakam. Antetokounmpo has come out on top in two of the last three games in this matchup. But Siakam is showing renewed energy after looking sluggish going into the All-Star break. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Wednesday, Feb. 26 (8 ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: Haven\u2019t met yet.  Perhaps this matchup can finally take place since the two haven\u2019t yet been on the court as opponents despite the teams facing each other twice already this season. A nine-time All-Star, Westbrook has tweaked his game somewhat to attack the rim more, and that has yielded positive results for Houston\u2019s small-ball attack. Morant modeled his game after Westbrook as a youngster and calls the veteran his favorite player. Morant will need to go after his idol in this one with Memphis clinging to the final playoff spot in the West. Westbrook lit up two-time Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert last week for 34 points. \u2022 Friday, Feb. 28 (8 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 14, 2019. The last time these players met, Donic suffered an ankle injury after playing in just two minutes of an eventual Heat victory in Dallas. Butler produced 38 points in a win over the 76ers earlier this month, and afterward jokingly compared himself to Doncic. It\u2019s clear both share admiration for one another. The Mavericks are exercising caution with Doncic as he\u2019s been sidelined twice this season with a sprained right ankle. But Doncic should be ready to go in this one after sitting one game last weekend to rest. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Wednesday, Feb. 26 (7 ET, League Pass) Last regular season meeting: Dec. 23, 2019. Update: Drummound will no longer play due to injury  There\u2019s plenty of history in this contentious rivalry . Embiid called himself \u201cthe best player in the world\u201d on Thursday, only to struggle three nights later (5-of-18 shooting) in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Embiid has been the dominant player in the series, but this game marks Drummond\u2019s first against the 76ers with his new team. Embiid has won the last three matchups, but the 76ers have been inconsistent on the road, where they are 9-20 entering this week. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . \u2022 Saturday, Feb. 29 (8:30 ET, ABC) Last regular season meeting: Feb. 11, 2020. Tatum tied a career-high, scoring 41 points while dropping 18 points in two different quarters on Sunday against the Lakers. The performance prompted LeBron James to call Tatum \u201can absolute problem\u201d in an Instagram post. That certainly appears to be the case, as he\u2019s scored 20 points or more in 12 of his last 13 games, averaging 28.7 ppg and 7.3 rpg during that stretch. Harden, meanwhile, is feasting on teams trying to adjust to Houston\u2019s small-ball style. He\u2019s averaged 34.5 ppg and 8.5 apg in his last four games entering this week. Harden has won the last four matchups in this series, scoring 42 points in the last meeting while Tatum shot 5 of 15. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . * * * Michael C.

Celebration of life for Kobe, Gianna The Lakers are rolling on the court, having won their fifth straight game on Sunday vs. the rival Celtics . However, today in L.A. everyone will be talking about Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Gianna as the Lakers host a celebration of life for them at 10 a.m. local time (1:30 p.m. ET). Some of the Celtics are expected to stick around today for the celebration in what is sure to be a memorable moment for all involved. 2. Sixers get chance to bounce back Saturday\u2019s nationally televised showdown with the Bucks couldn\u2019t have gone worse for the Sixers, who lost at home by 21 points and saw Giannis Antetokounmpo dominate Joel Embiid and Co. After failing against the East\u2019s best team, Philadelphia can try its luck against the East\u2019s worst as Atlanta pays a visit ( 7 ET, NBA TV ). It won\u2019t be easy, though, especially since the Hawks\u2019 Trae Young and John Collins have been hot since the All-Star break, ranking as the second-best scoring two-man lineup since then. 3. Bucks make history despite not playing Milwaukee\u2019s standout season continues to be a success \u2014 even when it takes the day off. The Wizards\u2019 loss to the Bulls on Sunday assured the Bucks of a playoff spot, making Milwaukee the fastest team to clinch a postseason berth in NBA history. The Wizards will get an up-close look at why Milwaukee is so good as they host them next ( 7 ET, League Pass ). The chase for 70 wins remains a realistic talking point for Milwaukee as it balances regular season history versus a potentially long playoff run. 4. Key showdown for Magic, Nets Over the next month, Brooklyn and Orlando will play three times, including tonight\u2019s matchup in New York ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). The Magic trail the Nets by 2 1\/2 games for No. 7 in the East and games like tonight\u2019s can shape who wins the season series and its tiebreakers. The schedule ahead seems to favor Orlando, which plays 15 of its next 19 games against teams with losing records. The Magic are 19-7 when facing sub-.500 teams this season and won the first matchup in this series back on Jan. 6. 5. Slumping squads meet in L.A. As the season wound toward the All-Star break, both the Grizzlies and Clippers were looking sharp. Memphis had won four of five games, while LA had won four of seven. Things have not been the same for either squad since: the Clippers have lost three straight, while the Grizzlies are riding a two-game skid. The teams meet tonight ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) and the Grizzlies may be in decidedly worse shape as big man Jaren Jackson Jr. will miss two weeks with a knee injury."},{"id":28530,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bill-russell-dons-kobe-jersey-lakers-game","date":"2020-02-24","title":"Bill Russell wears Kobe Bryant jersey to Celtics-Lakers game","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 The last time Bill Russell attended a Lakers-Celtics game here of any significance, it was in 2010 when his beloved Celtics lost the seventh game of the Finals and he awarded the MVP award, which had just been renamed in his honor the previous year, to Kobe Bryant.

Russell is 86 and rarely travels during the NBA season from his home in Seattle, except to the All-Star Game in February and to award the Finals MVP in June. He was greeted warmly prior to the game by a number of current and former Lakers, including Magic Johnson, who singled out Russell at an impromptu ceremony to celebrate the Lakers-Celtics rivalry. \u201cThat\u2019s why I won championships, because of that man right there,\u201d said Magic. \u201cHe\u2019s still the class of this league and we thank him for coming.\u201d When the photo of Russell in Kobe\u2019s jersey went viral on social media, Russell was moved to issue his own response , citing Kobe and his daughter Gigi, who also died in the helicopter crash that claimed nine lives: \u201cI would do anything to honor #KobeandGianna. I am always a Celtic. We had a deeper connection. 2 + 4 does = 6.

We all did this together. I didn\u2019t do this by myself.\u201d Wade\u2019s wife helped to hoist his No. 3 jersey to the rafters, where it joined the retired jerseys of four other Heat players \u2014 Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Chris Bosh. The ceremony was the centerpiece in a three-day celebration of Wade\u2019s 16-year NBA career, which included three championship seasons with the Heat. Wade, who now lives in Los Angeles, returned to the arena for the first time since his final home game in April 2019. \u201cThe man is hanging from the ceiling in a way he\u2019ll never be forgotten,\u201d Riley told the crowd. Wade reminisced about the impression he made helping Marquette beat Kentucky, Riley\u2019s alma mater, in the NCAA tournament. Months later, Riley and the Heat took Wade with the fifth overall pick in the 2003 draft, and spectators at the Miami arena that night roared their approval at the choice. \u201cAt that moment I felt your love,\u201d Wade told the crowd. \u201cThat was the first of many moments we would share together. Your appreciation and love has never left me.

After, but not during. Not while the action was on the court. Three nights earlier, Joel Embiid\u2019s mouth had gone into overdrive after the Sixers beat Brooklyn in OT , at one point stating matter-of-factly that he was the world\u2019s best basketball player. But Embiid was grounded in this one, settling for 17 points on 5-of-18 shooting, with 11 rebounds, four assists, four turnovers and one block. He sat with two quick fouls after halftime when the Sixers could least afford it \u2013 sidekick Ben Simmons checked out early in the first quarter with renewed back pain \u2013 and the Best Player in the World wound up minus-18 for the game. Once the thrashing was complete, a reminder of Embiid\u2019s big talk was lobbed up to the league\u2019s reigning MVP afterward like a fat pass, ready to be flushed. Antetokounmpo, metaphorically speaking, settled for a layup. \u201cI know that you\u2019re trying to do your job,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, smiling. \u201cYou want me to say something but it\u2019s going to go viral and he\u2019s going to see it, and then it\u2019s going to be a battle. \u201cBut I feel like Joel is a great guy. Obviously, when I go on the court, I\u2019m gonna go as hard as I can. But off the court, I like him. I like his personality. He\u2019s a down-to-earth guy.\u201d Antetokounmpo, finished with 31 points on 12-of-17 shooting, with 17 rebounds, eight assists, four turnovers and one block \u2013 in just 29 minutes. He worked his magic with former Bucks legend Oscar Robertson sitting near the home bench, and walked off at plus-27 in the blowout victory. The Bucks are now 26-3 at home; the Sixers, an alarming 9-20 on the road. So this would have been a perfect time for Antetokounmpo to gloat. But the Greek Freak went high rather than low. \u201cEvery NBA player should feel like he\u2019s the best player,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWho am I to tell him he\u2019s not the best player in the world? Who are we to tell him he\u2019s not the best player in the world? Everybody should feel that way. \u201cBut at the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to go on the court and \u2013 if you feel that way \u2013 you\u2019ve got to show it.\u201d Zing. It was late, it was subtle. But there it was. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be that guy,\u201d Embiid said, after not being that guy. The All-Star center\u2019s worst stretch coincided with Antetokounmpo\u2019s best. Embiid picked up his third and fourth fouls in the first 46 seconds of the third quarter and went to the bench for the next five-plus minutes. \u201cThe death knock,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown called it, after his team\u2019s fairly solid first half. Antetokounmpo scored the Bucks\u2019 first 11 points of the half, then assisted on four of Milwaukee\u2019s next six field goals. By the time Embiid checked back in, his team trailed by 15. By the start of the fourth, it was 93-73. Antetokounmpo twice did a little shimmy after scoring that seemed to mock some of Embiid\u2019s dance moves in other games. It easily could have been a statement, given the mileage Philadelphia got out of beating Milwaukee on Christmas at Wells Fargo Center (Antetokounmpo shot 8-for-27 with Embiid often defending him) and what Brown referred to as the \u201cgrowing competitive history with those two.\u201d Antetokounmpo demurred on the shimmy stuff. \u201cWho does that?\u201d he said, thinking for a moment. \u201cSteph [Curry] does that.\u201d Bottom line: If Embiid is indeed The Best Player in the World, maybe Antetokounmpo is simply extraterrestrial. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A senior at Farragut Academy on the city\u2019s West Side, Garnett was tearing up the high school scene not just locally but nationally (USA Today\u2019s Player of the Year). But he was still just that, a high school kid, spying on greatness. Until a security guard beckoned him to come down to the court, the Chicago Bulls\u2019 famous tandem curious to check out the tall, skinny wannabe. \u201cI just remember Pippen saying I was too young to be out here,\u201d Garnett said in a clip from a new Showtime documentary due out in October. Several thunderous dunks later and after some heated, NSFW trash-talking back at Pippen, Garnett heard a high-pitched voice loving the battle and egging him on. It was another Chicago legend, Hall of Famer and Detroit Pistons star Isiah Thomas, whose next words changed Garnett\u2019s life and those of dozens of other future NBA players. \u201cI just saw you play Scottie Pippen,\u201d Garnett recalled Thomas saying. \u201cBoy, you can play in the league right now.\u201d Until then, the notion of going straight from high school to the NBA hadn\u2019t crossed his mind. Within months, Garnett had made it a reality, getting selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cIsiah gave me the know-how and the process to go about it,\u201d Garnett told a small audience of reporters who showed up to learn more about the project. It will focus on the 15-time All-Star and newly minted Hall of Fame finalist , his role as a game-changer for players and for the league, and his trek across a quarter century of basketball and culture. \u201cThis is an idea that I thought was really cool,\u201d said Garnett, probably best known since he retired in 2016 for his \u201cArea 21\u201d appearances with TNT. \u201cYou\u2019re [normally] not gonna hear me talk about myself. But if you ask me a question, I feel like I\u2019ve got a story for damn near everything.\u201d Garnett already was a fan of Showtime\u2019s boxing series and its forays into basketball with documentaries on Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Ron Artest. Then he happened to meet, on an international flight, the network\u2019s president of sports and event programming. Garnett and Stephen Espinoza clicked in that long conversation and the seeds of the project were sown. \u201cLet me take you on an educational timeline of how we got here. Let\u2019s go all the way back to \u201995,\u201d Garnett said. Garnett spoke for a bit about the project, scheduled to debut not long after Garnett presumably is inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a fellow first-ballot choice with Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan. Then he took questions from about a half dozen media folks in the crowd. (Editor\u2019s Note: Portions of this conversation have been condensed and edited). * * * The Boston Celtics announced they will retire your jersey number next season. Any thoughts about the Timberwolves, for whom you played two-thirds of your 21 seasons, not doing that first? Listen, I had some great years in Minny. But when it comes to management, it\u2019s not even close. Minny, they run it one way. Boston, which has a culture of basketball, they run it a whole \u2018nother way. And I respect that. I can\u2019t tell a man [Wolves owner Glen Taylor, whom Garnett feels broke a promise to bring him in as a minority owner] what to do with his possessions or whatever he owns. But I\u2019m very appreciative of Boston and their retiring my number 5. How did you end up with a bigger role in the recent Adam Sandler feature film \u201cUncut Gems?\u201d They told me I was going to have a cool little get in-get out. Then two days turned into two weeks. Next thing you know, I\u2019ve got a book in front of me and I\u2019ve got to learn this whole exchange with Adam. It was fun. Acting is not something I\u2019m looking to do, but if you\u2019re all looking for a villain out there in your movie [laughs]. \u2026 Listen, I respect the whole cinematography process. I respect actors, actresses, the whole thing. Sixteen hour days is the norm. You\u2019ve got to be on point. It\u2019s very much like an NBA game. You have to be on your stuff. If you \u2018Cut!\u2019 and you mess it up, that means something. In the documentary clip, you tell a story about your Chicago workout, attended by skeptical NBA personnel for what was pitched as the first high school player trying to come directly into the league since Moses Malone and Bill Willoughby two decades earlier. What was that like? When you go through this process, you have to actually fly out. But I was still in school, so I couldn\u2019t fly anywhere. I had to have the workouts come to Chicago. You could feel that GMs and the owners did not want to be in there. If anything made me nervous, that was [it] \u2014 I had never done nothing like this. I had never worked out in front of anybody professionally. I heard [Miami Heat president] Pat Riley like, \u2018Damn \u2026 what the\u2026\u2019 When I heard that, I lost it. I forgot everything. The nerves went away. And I attacked steel with steel. You grew up in South Carolina but transferred for your senior season to Farragut Academy. How did that experience shape you? My year at Farragut actually helped me with the competition. There was so much good competition in the city of Chicago, I was never lacking an opportunity, I was never lacking a matchup, I was never lacking a certain level that I thought I needed to have, to go to the next level, D1 or whatever that was. Not to say I won every battle, but I competed against \u2014 ask anybody in this city, they know me for hoopin\u2019. Not just on the West Side but on the North Side, South Side where us West Siders go. I was playing a bunch on the South Side, courts where you had to get permission to come. I was in projects playing, where you ain\u2019t supposed to be over here. \u2026 Every Saturday, playing against the Carver [High School] kids, the Simeon [High School] kids, the King kids. That\u2019s how I got a reputation in this city. I\u2019d go up and play the DePaul guys once they was done with practice. Did you ever come close to playing for the Chicago Bulls? And why do you think the Bulls have so much trouble signing top free agents? I was never close to signing with the Bulls, ever. [long pause] I don\u2019t really have a \u2018Why?\u2019 There was never an opportunity to. And I saw how Jerry [Krause, longtime Bulls GM] was with Jordan. All players keep that in the back of their minds. \u2018If you treat the greatest like this\u2026\u2019 The greatest didn\u2019t even come back and have a chance to have ownership, the way [chairman Jerry Reinsdorf] invested to build the Bulls. He didn\u2019t get a chance to come back and reap the benefits of that. Y\u2019know? Guys see that and remember that, and put it in the back of their minds. Who knows? Different times though. Shoutout to Zach LaVine, he\u2019s doing his thing. Let\u2019s see if they keep that nucleus together. Was there a moment in your rookie year where you thought, \u2018I belong here?\u2019 It took me about maybe 45 games. Flip [Saunders, Wolves coach] decided that he wanted to start me\u2026 The stuff I had been working on with [VP of basketball operations and legendary Celtics Hall of Famer] Kevin McHale, I wasn\u2019t necessarily strong enough to get it off. I had to face [up], I couldn\u2019t put my back to the basket. \u2018Mac\u2019 had these big, wide shoulders, and he\u2019s showing you a move where, if you don\u2019t have big shoulders, you can\u2019t do the move. \u2018Do the [bleep] move!\u2019 Finally I\u2019d go home, I\u2019d be so traumatized, think \u2018That stuff don\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m gonna face.\u2019 I would take it through a process, make it fit. I got two, three moves, I got confident, I knew how to get \u2018em off against smaller. Taller guys I could face and go around \u2018em, and I started to understand how to use my speed. The strength that I did have. My jumping ability. Once I figured it out, that\u2019s where my confidence came from\u2026 My first 20-point game, it was all from those two moves and hustling. I was seeing people who wasn\u2019t in great shape, so I started outrunning people and using my youthfulness. Now I\u2019m dunking everything. I\u2019m not laying nothin\u2019 up. I\u2019m putting it on your head and I want you to know I\u2019m putting it on your head. I wanted to be this young lion that everybody was looking at. He came out of high school? You see some of my early times, when I watch film of myself, I was such an angry kid. [But] it was really coffee. Coffee made me like a wild animal. Late in your career, you said you would never coach and that you\u2019d \u201cfade to black\u201d as far as public profile.\u201d Why hasn\u2019t that happened? I tried that. Steve [Espinoza] called me, man. What you want me to say? I\u2019m trying to chill. Turner called me. \u2026 I\u2019m trying to get to the fade-to-black, but they won\u2019t let me. We\u2019re gonna build something here and put something dope out. I like this production [work]. I\u2019m a visual guy. I\u2019m with some great partners. We\u2019re all synergized in what we believe in. We have something here so we\u2019re going to present it to the world. Since you\u2019ve been retired, has it changed how you relate to the guys who came before you or the guys who are playing today? My love for the history and the guys who have come before me has always been the same: respect. I seen Spencer Haywood at the Hall of Fame [finalists announcement] and he was the first person I had to go up and dap. I don\u2019t know if y\u2019all know this, in \u201968, he was the first player to ever get his rights to play, so that we have the option to come out of high school and do these things. Whenever I\u2019m talking to Dwight [Howard] or talking to LeBron [James], people in the game, I always make it a point for them to know their history. Because without them creating this path for us, none of us would be here. When you were traded by Minnesota, there reportedly was a chance your destination could be the Lakers. What happened? In \u201907, I had a chance to go to Phoenix. I had a chance to go to the Warriors. To the Celtics, obviously, and the Lakers. I was trying to get Kobe on the phone, and he was on a Nike Italy Something [tour]. \u2026 I had to make a decision. I had a conversation with Steve Nash, and it was a terrible conversation. And I had known Paul [Pierce], Paul and I were friends from way back, 14-15 years old. I was with two personal friends, Chauncey Billups and Tyronn Lue, working out, and they just gave it to me really raw, man. \u2018If you\u2019re trying to win and actually be something that you\u2019re talking about, that we know you want to be, you\u2019re gonna have to move, you\u2019re gonna have to make some hard decisions.\u2019 That\u2019s when I first started to actually think about, \u2018I\u2019ve got to leave Minny? Aw man.\u2019 Shoutout to Minny, man. I didn\u2019t want to leave but I felt like I had no choice, too. But the opportunity in Boston was a great one, I\u2019m glad I made the decision to do that. I\u2019m glad I had friends, real ones, to kind of take me through that. Could you have co-existed with Kobe? Absolutely. People know me, I\u2019m a very sure person \u2014 I don\u2019t lack any confidence in myself. But I can also be a great Robin. I\u2019m a Batman, don\u2019t get it twisted. I can be a great Robin. Paul Pierce is a big ego, he\u2019s a big personality. That\u2019s what he shines at. I understood I was coming to his team, and I wanted him to know that. I played a great Robin when I had to. But in my own life, I\u2019m an alpha, I\u2019m a king, I run my own stuff. I don\u2019t mind being able to step to the side and let someone be great also. Absolutely we could co-exist. If he could play with Shaq he could play with me. One my greatest attributes is that I was a great teammate, whoever it was. You can ask that. What else can we expect, when this documentary hits the network in October? If I was to put it into an example, imagine that in 2020, I\u2019m going to take you all the way back to \u201995. We\u2019re gonna cover music, we\u2019re gonna cover fashion, we\u2019re gonna cover style. Think about the moves that the guys put on now. A lot of stuff that\u2019s east-west, which means it doesn\u2019t go from me straight to you, playing north to south. Music, how you dance and how you sway, your bop. Everybody walks to a bop, everybody walks to a beat, believe it or not. That\u2019s in your style of play. So when we went to the basket, that\u2019s how your bop played, we was finishing with that. The music now is a different bop. When I\u2019m watching guys work out, it\u2019s to this new music, it\u2019s to this new fashion. So it\u2019s all synergized. So I\u2019m asking the question, \u2018How did we get here to 2020?\u2019 * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Or maybe even king of the world. After all, topping the Bucks in Milwaukee would rank as a stunning upset compared to beating the Nets at Wells Fargo Center in Philly. And not just because of the opposition. The Sixers win almost all the time at home. They travel, however, as if someone has made off with their emotional support animals. At 26-2, Philadelphia\u2019s home record is the league\u2019s best, one game better than the Bucks\u2019 (25-3). On the road, their 9-19 results rank 20th \u2013 and the teams that are worse are headed to the draft lottery or the lowest playoff seeds and likely first-round eliminations. The Sixers \u2013 projected as a top Eastern Conference contender, even a potential Finals champ \u2013 have no business floundering with that bunch. Their overall record, 35-21, has them on track to top 50 victories. They have two All-Stars, both elite defenders, in Embiid and Ben Simmons. A third star, full-service scorer Tobias Harris, was signed to a max deal last summer and general manager Elton Brand lured savvy veteran Al Horford away from the rival Celtics. They rank fourth in defensive rating (106.0) and third in defensive rebound percentage (75.4). And yet Philadelphia is 1-13 on the road against teams with winning records. Y\u2019know, the sort it eventually will run into in the postseason. Even a No. 1 seed wouldn\u2019t presume to survive two or three best-of-seven series relying entirely on its comfort level at home. Time was, that wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker for a legit contender. In fact, three NBA champions of the 1970s \u2013 the Warriors in \u201975, the Trail Blazers in \u201977 and the Bullets in \u201978 \u2013 all won in spite of their losing road records. But it hasn\u2019t happened in the 42 years since, and the Sixers\u2019 margin of error is down to just one before they\u2019re locked into a sub-.500 season on the road. So while records reset to 0-0 when the playoffs begin, bad habits generally don\u2019t. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a traditional-type team,\u201d coach Brett Brown said recently. The usual suspects when an otherwise good team sputters away from home are youth, inexperience and a lack of chemistry. Throw out the first two with these Sixers \u2013 they\u2019re neither too young nor too raw \u2013 and we\u2019re left with the third, where this crew definitely has room for improvement. Earlier this month, remember, Horford appeared to pull back the curtain on some discontent when he said in the midst of a four-game losing streak: \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff going on in our locker room and we\u2019ll keep that internal. We all know we need to be better.\u201d Particularly when their cell phones switch to roaming. \u201cYou look at our record on the road, it\u2019s like, \u2018How can that be?\u2019\u201d Brown said last week. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this at home and this on the road, it\u2019s two different personalities. \u2026 Have we had bad shootarounds? Have we had bad practices? Is the spirit of the group that polluted that we can\u2019t navigate through stuff? And it isn\u2019t.\u201d Brown admitted that the struggles away from Wells Fargo are \u201ca little bit of a mystery,\u201d even to him. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this long enough to live in the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t point to any of [the theories] as being \u2018uh oh.\u2019\u201d This team does have obvious flaws. Simmons, its point guard, doesn\u2019t shoot from the outside; he has responded to Brown\u2019s request that he attempt at least one 3-pointer nightly by taking six in 53 games. Embiid put the lie to early-season reports that he had sculpted himself into better shape; the big man still looks to be carrying extra weight and lacks stamina. Meanwhile, the 7-footer has hoisted 147 more 3-pointers than Simmons, hitting at a mediocre 34%. Keep in mind, Philadelphia\u2019s rationale for more perimeter shooting is to open up space for Embiid down low, not to have him shoot them. Harris hasn\u2019t been the closer that Jimmy Butler was for their team last season. With J.J. Redick leaving for New Orleans, the Sixers\u2019 deep threats were limited, prompting Brand to add Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III at the trade deadline. Then there\u2019s Horford, whose impact in the starting lineup was proving oddly deleterious at both ends. After starting his first 49, the veteran has come off the bench in Philadelphia\u2019s most recent two. Brown is expected to stick with that. Philadelphia fans\u2019 reasons for optimism might not yet counter their reasons for skepticism, but they\u2019re real. Embiid missed 16 of the first 47 games but has played nine straight, averaging 23 points and 11 rebounds (not quite \u201cbest in the world\u201d quality). Defensively, he is an absolute shot alterer, while blocking 1.4 per game. Eleven of Simmons\u2019 15 20-point games have come since Jan. 1, suggesting a newfound aggressiveness on offense. Oh, and the back pain that sidelined him Thursday apparently will allow him to play against the Bucks. Wing Josh Richardson missed 14 of the first 52 games, but he\u2019s back too, logging heavy minutes these days. Burks and Robinson, in their bench roles, are combining for more than 35 points on a per-36 minutes basis. Don\u2019t forget the schedule, which will be one of the league\u2019s easiest to close out the regular season. Except, y\u2019know, for the 13 road games left on it. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

(Paul would disagree with that consideration, by the way.) As they begin their post-break schedule with a game against the Denver Nuggets on Friday ( 8 ET, ESPN ), the Thunder are in sixth place in the Western Conference , just two games behind the team that traded Paul, two first-round picks and two pick swaps for Russell Westbrook last summer. OKC is on pace to win the same number of games as it did last season, when it had Westbrook and Paul George (who finished third in MVP voting). For his efforts in leading that kind of recovery, Paul was selected to his 10th All-Star Game , four years after his previous appearance. And on Sunday, he had his highest-scoring All-Star performance of the 10, shooting 7-for-11 from 3-point range and finishing with 23 points for the victorious Team LeBron. At All-Star weekend in Chicago, NBA.com sat down with Paul at the launch event of PlayersTV , a network (in which Paul is an investor) for athlete-driven content set to launch in March on Samsung TV Plus. He discussed the need for such a platform, and then the conversation turned to basketball, pick-and-roll defense and mid-range shooting, teaching and learning from Kobe Bryant, and mentoring Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. NBA.com: What are you guys trying to accomplish with PlayersTV? Chris Paul: I think one of the biggest things was being able to provide content for guys who may otherwise not be able to have their stuff on ESPN or other platforms. What\u2019s really cool about is just about everybody who does any type of entertainment or advertising, they use athletes. So this is a place where content can be created and be a hub where athletes have an opportunity to tell stories. Are you going to be in the background, or will you be a content creator yourself? I\u2019m definitely a content creator. Absolutely. The cool thing about it is that a lot of guys already have production companies and different things going on. And now, we have somewhere their stories can live and we\u2019re able to tell the stories that sometimes other people try to tell for us. The guy who may be a role player for eight or nine years may have a story to tell. Now there\u2019s somewhere it can live. And guys can support one another and bring people to the platform. So if you\u2019re creating content, what might we learn about you? Who knows? It\u2019s not just me, either. Fortunately, I\u2019m able to tell my story day in and day out. It\u2019s about all the athletes as a whole and seeing what we can do together. It gives more and more players a voice and an opportunity for fans to see them. Gerald Green, a teammate of mine in Houston, just popped into my head. Fans loved him. Loved him. And there are a whole lot of layers to Gerald. But sometimes he can\u2019t tell his story. Are you surprised at all with how well the Thunder have played this season? Nope. I\u2019m surprised our record isn\u2019t better. I\u2019m wired like that. But going into the season, there had to be more questions than the season before in Houston. When you were with the Clippers, there was always a lot of talent. There wasn\u2019t a greater degree of doubt this time? I know me. I know y\u2019all got a job to do. Y\u2019all are going to predict this [or that]. But you got to play the games. I\u2019ve never stepped on the court in a game like, \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going to win this.\u201d But there\u2019s probably guys in the league who do that, you know what I mean? I don\u2019t work like that. No. You\u2019ve been Mr. Clutch this season. Note: Paul leads the league in points scored with the game within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime . We\u2019ve played a lot of close games. If you play a lot of close games, you\u2019re going to score. Well, you\u2019ve also shot 55% on clutch shots. OK. Well, that\u2019s pretty good. If you\u2019re running a pick-and-roll late in the game, how do know that you can get to your spot? Because it\u2019s a copy-cat league. It\u2019s a copy-cat NBA. So, in my last year with the Clippers, we went to a drop. You know what I\u2019m talking about when I say drop. The big defender drops back into the paint to protect the basket. Me and DeAndre Jordan, the two years before that, we were the best pick-and-roll defenders in the league. When he was playing up \u2026 When he was playing up, because we used to play like that. Then in my last year with the Clippers, we went to the drop. And me and DJ were actually talking about this the other day. We were mad when we came into camp and went to that drop. But it\u2019s a copy-cat league. Everybody went into this drop to play the percentages. Right. And over 82 games, over 48 minutes, it makes sense. But there are certain times when you can\u2019t let a guy get to an open shot. I also think, \u201cWin the game. Win the game.\u201d You can do all the analytics that you want to, but at the end of the day, win the game. So if I perfect this shot and that\u2019s the shot that you\u2019re giving me, I\u2019m going to take it. Then, if you come up, now I\u2019m going to adjust to that. But the thing about the NBA, every single night, how do they guard the ball screen now? They drop, except for one or two teams. Chicago plays up. They play up. And it\u2019s funny, when you play against them and you watch the games, people start turning the ball over, because they don\u2019t know. Right. They lead the league in opponent turnover percentage . Do they? That\u2019s because guys now don\u2019t know the reads. That was the old NBA, when everybody guarded like that. That\u2019s a good point. Guys are so used to playing against a drop now and so used to the reads against a drop coverage \u2026 It\u2019s like having the answers to a test. If I know the guy is back, I\u2019m getting right there to shoot it. But playing against a team that brings the big man up, like the Heat when they had the Big Three, is a lot different. The big man is up, the low man is over. So, Shai is my man. That\u2019s like my little brother. Shai, when we play against those teams that are up, he\u2019s like, \u201cC, what\u2019s the read? What\u2019s the read?\u201d And I\u2019ll be laughing, because that was the old NBA. And now it\u2019s a copy-cat league and a lot of bigs will be guarding like Shaq used to guard, just sit back in the paint. So guards know they\u2019re either getting to their floater or, if they\u2019re a 3-point shooter, they\u2019re stopping at the 3-point line.  And you\u2019re a mentor to Shai? I\u2019ll be real hard on him, though. Last night [the last game before the All-Star break], he got a foul \u2026 Jrue Holiday. So Shai watches the games with me. Even after our home games, he\u2019ll come over to the condo and watch games. Shai got a foul on Jrue Holiday in our game last night. And it\u2019s funny, because I didn\u2019t even look at him, but he wouldn\u2019t look at me. So when we got in at halftime, I said, \u201cYou good?\u201d And he was like, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even gonna look at you.\u201d Because I have a problem with pump fakes. I don\u2019t go for pump fakes. You know why? I played against Sam Cassell in my first or second year in the league. And I got three fouls on him in one game, because Sam Cassell would come down, [mimics a pump fake] and lean into me. And then I had an epiphany. I am not a shot-blocker. And I tried to explain this to Shai and he doesn\u2019t understand it. If you don\u2019t jump and you just stand there and contest it, and he makes it? Good shot. But if I jump, now you\u2019re either going to go by me or lean into me. So I don\u2019t go for pump fakes. The other day, after he hit a mid-range game-winner , Spencer Dinwiddie said that Kenny Atkinson doesn\u2019t want him shooting mid-range shots unless it\u2019s at the end of the game . And I get that, because over 82 games or even 48 minutes, if he shoots 40% from mid-range, that\u2019s not a good return on 10 or 100 shots. You\u2019re different. You\u2019re shooting 55% from mid-range . But even for a 40% mid-range shooter, in a late-game situation when you need a bucket, that may be where you can get the cleanest look. Dennis Schroder \u2026 I don\u2019t know what his percentage is this season \u2026 Note: Schroder has shot a solid 47% from mid-range, the 11th best mark among 67 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts . But coming into the season, I don\u2019t think it was great. But just like anything, I got to show you that I can do it. If I show you that I can do it, then they\u2019re going to be cool with it. But if you\u2019re not good at it, don\u2019t shoot it. Because I\u2019m also a firm believer that if you got a 3-point shot and you take one foot in, I hate that shot. If you\u2019re going to be that close to the 3-point line, you might as well shoot a 3. Right. Your 2-point shots are generally 18 feet and in. Note: 93% of Paul\u2019s mid-range shots have come from 18 feet and in. Right. I\u2019m gonna get to my spot. And referencing Kobe, and I tell all the young guys this \u2026 Kobe against the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs, I think it was overtime \u2026 The game-winner from the elbow . Right. He didn\u2019t even look at the rim one time. When I\u2019m dribbling in the lane, there are spots on the floor, I don\u2019t have to look at the rim once you hit the spot. The one thing about that shot that I always remember is the way it ripped through the net. It was one of the most pure swishes you will ever see. Just look at him when he gets the ball. He never looked at the rim.  That reminds me. One of my distinct memories from covering the 2008 Olympics was you and Kobe talking about pick-and-rolls on the court before one of your exhibition games in Macao or Shanghai. Do you remember that? Vaguely. But around that time, the snake that everybody does, I started doing that with Tyson my second year in the league. Note: The snake is where a pick-and-roll ball-handler changes direction after dribbling past the screen in order to keep his initial defender on his back. I just came up with it in practice, because back then, everybody used to go under on me, because I couldn\u2019t really shoot \u2026 I could shoot, but it\u2019s just anxiety when you\u2019re young. You can shoot, but you just don\u2019t make in in the game. So everybody used to go under [the screen] on me. So we had Tyson start setting it at an angle, and I realized that if I cut back, the defender was going to be behind me and it was going to force a 2-on-1. And that was when I was a lot more athletic, so I would either finish with a layup or throw the lob to Tyson. Now, at this point, I snake, I don\u2019t want to get to the rim. So that\u2019s what you were talking about with Kobe? Yeah, I was definitely talking about that, getting the defender on my hip. What were you learning from him in that same time frame? One of the biggest things Kob made me pay attention to was footwork. And it\u2019s crazy, because my percentages this year in the mid-post are awful. But I\u2019ve always been able to play off left-foot or right-foot pivot. Note: According to Second Spectrum tracking, Paul has shot 2-for-11 (18%) on post-ups this season after shooting 63-for-128 (49%) over the last three seasons. In our GM Survey , you always get a lot of votes as the active player that will make the best head coach someday. Do you want to coach? No chance. It\u2019s the time. I don\u2019t want to travel like that. I want to be around the game as much as possible. I watch every game. But I want to be around my kids and family. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .
