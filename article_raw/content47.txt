About halfway through Wednesday\u2019s 10-game slate, we\u2019ll reach the 1\/4 mark of the season (308 of 1,230 games played), the point when it\u2019s fair to believe in what we\u2019ve seen so far, what teams are good, and what teams aren\u2019t. Over the last 10 (82-game) seasons, 136 of the 160 teams (about 14 per year) that eventually made the playoffs were in playoff position at the 1\/4 mark of the season. Last season, all eight of the teams that made the West playoffs were in the top eight on Dec. 5 (when 302 games had been played). In the East, six of the eventual playoff teams were in the top eight , with the Hawks (a half game out) and the Wizards (three games out) being the exceptions. We had some parity over the first month this season, but through Sunday, there are actually fewer teams within two games of .500 ( six ) than there were at the quarter mark last season ( eight ). Over the last couple of weeks, teams have begun to sort themselves out. Nine teams have already hit the 20-game mark and the other 21 will do so this week. Over the last 10 full seasons, 98 of the 102 teams that had at least 12 wins through their first 20 games made the playoffs. Over that span in the East, almost 70 percent teams that had a 9-11 record through their first 20 games have made the playoffs, while the percentage dropped dramatically for teams with an 8-12 record or worse. In the West, the cut-off has been at 11 wins. That\u2019s good news for teams like the 11-8 Pelicans and 11-9 Pacers, who weren\u2019t expected by most to make the playoffs, but have gotten off to good starts. And it may make us look a little closer at the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s 8-11 record through Sunday. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 100.5 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 104.3 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

For now, I know I can control the pace of the game. I\u2019m somebody who likes to run and I know a lot of guys aren\u2019t trying to sprint down the court every single time. So attacking them when they\u2019re backpedaling, it\u2019s tough to guard.\u201d So, for 48 glorious regular season minutes, the league had Simmons flummoxed. He\u2019s kind of figured things out during the subsequent 768, and might have an edge for the next 38,000 or so. After missing what would have been his rookie season last year with a foot injury, Simmons, the first pick overall in the 2016 Draft , is flourishing in Philadelphia, the very place where Joel Embiid seemed to redefine what was possible for a big man a season ago. In doing so, Simmons is, in his first tour around the league, making his own mark at point guard. No man who handles the rock every night has stood as tall at the 6-foot-10 Simmons \u2013 Hall of Famer Magic Johnson was 6-foot-9. And in an era where everyone must shoot 3-pointers or be branded as wanting by many in the advanced stats community, Simmons simply refuses to shoot them \u2014 ever \u2014 unless they\u2019re end-of-quarter or half-court heaves. Simmons leads all rookies in scoring ( 18.5 points per game ), rebounds ( 9.1 ), assists ( 7.7 ) and steals ( 2.1 ), contributing across all lines and at the defensive end, providing two-way play that\u2019s as good as any rookie since David Robinson ( 24.3 points, 12 rebounds and 3.9 blocks per game for San Antonio in 1989-90, leading a 35-win improvement over the previous season for the Spurs ) or Wilt Chamberlain (a cartoonish 37.6 points and 27 rebounds per game in 1959-60 for the Philadelphia Warriors). Oscar Robertson\u2019s rookie line in Cincinnati in 1960-61 \u2014 30.5 points, 10 rebounds, 9.7 assists per game \u2014 remains the all-time standard for a first-year point guard. Simmons will not come close to \u201cThe Big O\u201d in terms of scoring average, but he doesn\u2019t have to and he\u2019s not being asked to do it. He just takes what\u2019s available \u2014 and then, a lot of what doesn\u2019t seem to be. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would come this quickly for me to get this comfortable and to improve every game, but it did,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cOverall I\u2019ve felt like every game I\u2019ve been able to score, or get to the rim, or get shots when I want, and feel comfortable.\u201d Simmons has injected even more turbo fuel into \u201cThe Process\u201d, the prize for a 10-win season two years ago. With Simmons and Embiid on the floor \u2014 and without the injured Markelle Fultz, taken first overall by the Sixers in the 2017 Draft \u2014 Philly has 11 wins already in the first quarter of the season. Interest locally is as high as it\u2019s been since the Iverson days. The Sixers have skyrocketed from 28th in home attendance two years ago to 18th last year to second this year, averaging 20,667 through eight home dates. Only the Chicago Bulls (21,363) are doing better. \u201cWe kind of got a taste of it last year,\u201d Embiid said Friday. \u201cAnd then this year, getting Markelle as the No. 1 pick, Ben coming back and then the excitement of last year, it\u2019s pretty great, and I love it. The fans are passionate, and I love it. I know they have my back and they have our back. I think you just kind of expect it because we have so much talent. \u201cThe future looks bright. It\u2019s a good thing that the fans are coming in and showing their support, because I know they want to do that. And they\u2019re passionate about it. They want us to win games. They want us to be in the playoffs.\u201d Simmons wants more. \u201cOur goal is to win the championship for as long as we can keep everybody together,\u201d Simmons said Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal, to win it all. Everybody loves being here. Everybody loves the coaches here, Bryan (Colangelo, the general manager), all the guys up top, they\u2019re all good people. I think it just takes time, and that\u2019s our goal. Philly fans are the best. They show a lot of love wherever I am, whether I\u2019m at dinner, walking down the street, coming out of my apartment, they show a lot of love.\u201d The hard-core fans were always there, but now the casuals are back, enough to pack Wells Fargo Center on a cold Wednesday night before Thanksgiving (yes, a lot of kids and families may be in town for turkey the next day, but still) to see the Sixers play the Trail Blazers \u2014 all due respect to Portland, currently not a league powerhouse. And Simmons, as he\u2019s displayed throughout his rookie season, controls the game. He is only 8 of 20 this night, but still nets a +18 on the evening, just falling short of a triple-double with 16 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. His team doesn\u2019t play great \u2014 a \u201cC-minus\u201d on offense, Sixers coach Brett Brown says \u2014 but it\u2019s a sign of how far things have come in the Illadelph that the 76ers can be mediocre on one side of the ball and still win a game comfortably. \u201cWe understand we haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d Brown tells you afterward. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t. It\u2019s not a throwaway line. We completely understand that. Our goal is to make the playoffs. Everything that we do and talk about and drill, we do it with that spirit. When it doesn\u2019t reach that standard, it\u2019s easy for me to remind them that I lived a privileged life in San Antonio, and that is not of a playoff standard. We want actions and not just coined phrases and words.\u201d Anyone with a functioning heart is happy for Brown, who wore every one of those 253 losses on his ledger the first four years of \u201cThe Process\u201d as he continued to try and develop the seemingly endless parade of players that came through Philly. There were successes amidst all the losing, with Robert Covington and T.J. McConnell both becoming reliable rotation players. But no one saw more bottom to get here than Brown did. And if Simmons continues to perform as he\u2019s done his first month, Philly\u2019s dreams of a dominant future can be as big as they want. Who would sport a more lethal young duo than Simmons and Embiid? \u201cI was actually pretty surprised,\u201d Embiid said of Simmons\u2019 fast start. \u201cI watched him play against the guys this past summer, and he was kind of hesitant. That was the way that we were guarding him. He would always take the running hook or the floater. It wasn\u2019t going well for him. And then, we just started, I guess the games are different. He\u2019s making a lot of those. And he\u2019s going to get anywhere he wants to go \u2014 he\u2019s so big, he\u2019s so fast, he\u2019s so athletic.\u201d Simmons\u2019s father, Dave, is only slightly shorter (6-foot-8) than his son. Dave Simmons grew up in New York City and played for Abe Lemons at Oklahoma City University, but played a dozen years for five teams in Australia from 1989-2001 before going into coaching. But Simmons pere  was a bruiser, a physical post player who attacked the paint when he got the ball. Ben has hops and all that, but he doesn\u2019t attack as much as he flows. He obviously has different sight lines than almost any point who\u2019s ever lived, so there\u2019s no open man he\u2019s going to miss. But the son\u2019s game is diametrically different from the father\u2019s. That is not an accident, or happenstance. As both Ben and his sister, Olivia, came to the game, Dave Simmons didn\u2019t let their respective heights determine their destiny; he encouraged both to handle the ball and face the basket. \u201cKids need to be allowed to experiment and be creative,\u201d Dave Simmons told Sports Illustrated last year , and that is evident in Ben. \u201cFrom a young age, he wanted me to be able to do everything he couldn\u2019t do,\u201d Ben Simmons says. \u201cI think that\u2019s where it comes from, him telling me to dribble the ball, take whatever shots I want, be creative on the court. That allowed me to be who I am today. I still, in practice, I\u2019ll do crazy (things), because that\u2019s how you learn. You have to make mistakes to learn. Even if the coach does get mad in practice \u2026 I\u2019m confident in my abilities so I\u2019m not worried about messing up. I know I\u2019m going to have bad games, I\u2019m going to have good games. You just have to play hard. So that comes with it.\u201d Brown coached Dave Simmons in Australia for four years and knows both Dave Simmons and his wife, Julie \u2014 who was a cheerleader for the Melbourne Tigers team that employed them all at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that his dad, who is a hell of a player and actually a hell of a coach, designed and groomed his son to have ball skills and not just assume that he\u2019s big, and, yep, it\u2019s fine if these junior coaches make you a four man or a center,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI have an evolving son who\u2019s 13, and I\u2019m a son of a coach, so you see people get positioned based on their height when they\u2019re young,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he (Dave) never permitted that. And so, he\u2019s smart. From that perspective, it doesn\u2019t surprise me. He gave Ben the skill package to be a modern-day NBA player.\u201d Well, mostly. Defenses have taken note of the fact that Simmons has not attempted a single conventional 3-pointer so far in his NBA career \u2014 not a surprise, considering he only shot three in 33 games at LSU. Defenders go under on Sixers\u2019 pick and rolls involving Simmons almost by rote, trying to make Simmons pull up and shoot from distance. Yet he doesn\u2019t take the bait, doesn\u2019t stay stuck in that open space. \u201cI just know physically I can power against anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cGuys go so far back it\u2019s like, might as well go to the rim every time. Nobody\u2019s going to take a charge in there. And a hook shot, that\u2019s like the basics for me. I make most of them. If they keep doing that I\u2019m going to just keep doing what I do, and go to the rim.\u201d So many young point guards would be goaded into using that room to either show off their (non-existent) shooting skills or pat the ball within an inch of its life, looking to break some defender\u2019s ankles to get on Top Plays. But Simmons does neither of those look at me things. According to NBA.com\/Stats, his average of 3.36 dribbles per touch ranks just 43rd in the league among players who are averaging 25 minutes or more per game \u2014 significantly fewer than league leader John Wall (5.98, and that\u2019s not a criticism of Wall; just a comparison of how point guards can be effective in different ways). Simmons usually just takes a big step with his long legs, which leaves him at the foul line or in the paint without having given up his dribble \u2014 \u201cevery piece they give you, just run it down their throat,\u201d Brown said after Wednesday\u2019s game. From there, it\u2019s usually a jump hook \u2014 usually with the right hand, though Simmons can use either at the rim \u2014 or a quick step to get a shoulder in front, and he\u2019s at the basket. This happens almost every time he has the ball. It is incredible. It makes Simmons\u2019 unwillingness (or inability) to shoot from the perimeter irrelevant. And it makes him, already, almost unguardable. Again, the hook is not something that young guys tend to have in their bag when they come to the pros \u2014 and certainly not young point guards. But Simmons does. He\u2019s taken 71.5 percent of his shots so far from less than 10 feet from the basket . (The only problem on the horizon: Simmons shoots just 56.6 percent from the foul line.) \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of had it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just like a simple shot for me. And you can get it whenever you want. It\u2019s just natural. Watching games, and feeling comfortable taking that shot, and realizing that guys can\u2019t really guard that shot.\u201d Said Brown: \u201che plays with a poise. And can go from 20 miles an hour up to 90, back to 60, down to 10 \u2014 in his speed and in his mind. And there\u2019s a poise he navigates courts with that caught me way off guard. That is a sign, or a quality, of someone who\u2019s older. So this gap, these massive gaps \u2014 some people might also treat it like it\u2019s an insult. Like that Hack-a-Shaq. \u201cYou can tell with some people when they shoot free throws \u2014 they want nothing to do with the line. He\u2019s fine with (getting space). You can go under as much as you want \u2014 I\u2019m not taking it personally. I\u2019m going to find a way to queue up space and get to the rim.\u201d Simmons still has work to do, on the subtle aspects of the game \u2014 \u201cJo hasn\u2019t had a touch in six trips; you feel that. There\u2019s no play call needed; a team feels that,\u201d Brown said to reporters Wednesday \u2014 but he\u2019s so far down the road already in his development. And defensively, Simmons has been versatile and much more engaged than he appeared to be in college. The Sixers are ninth overall in Defensive Rating (102.2) and Simmons has been very solid at that end, too; playing ones through fours depending on the opponent, he\u2019s defending without fouling. His individual Defensive Rating of 100.7 is 31st overall among players who play 25 minutes or more and sixth-best among point guards, trailing only Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart and Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry. Simmons says he watched a ton of film during his year off on players around the league, learning tendencies, and that it\u2019s helped him defensively. \u201cIt gets tough, but I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun guarding guys like Kyrie and John Wall, and then Steph, and then switching up to a bigger guy like KD or whoever it is. I think overall, I\u2019ve been doing pretty well.\u201d There was no debate in the Philly war room about taking Simmons first overall in 2016. But there were \u201clively discussions\u201d about Simmons\u2019 ability to play the point effectively in the pros, said one person who was in the room. Would the 76ers be at their best with Simmons on the ball? Would he be elite at the position? Could he lead players? And would his lack of shooting clog up what the Sixers hoped would be a free flowing, high octane offense? At LSU, \u201che didn\u2019t show that he could rally a group, or bring the best out of others, the electric personality,\u201d the person in the room said. \u201cSo the Magic Johnson comparisons weren\u2019t on point. Some felt that (he was) maybe more of a Lamar Odom, talented, but would have to be a key piece, not the main guy.\u201d Famously, LSU didn\u2019t make the tournament in Simmons\u2019 one year there. But he says he had no doubt that his game would still show through to pro scouts. \u201cPeople who know the game know the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know from watching good players if you\u2019re good or not. Anybody can go to Kentucky or Duke if you\u2019re a top player, obviously. Any good player can go to schools like that. It also takes a certain person to not to go to a school like that. I love to compete, and I want to play against the Dukes and Kentuckys and teams like that. And I enjoyed that.\u201d But he had to wait another year after breaking the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot during the Sixers\u2019 final camp scrimmage last year. He had surgery to fix the bone, but when X-rays didn\u2019t show the foot had fully healed last February, the 76ers shut him down for the rest of the season . But an important thing transpired nonetheless last season. Brown decided that Simmons would be his point guard of the future. \u201cEven before I got hurt, he wanted me to run the point some times,\u201d Simmons recalled. \u201cAnd after my foot, he said you\u2019re going to be the point guard. He kept asking me, actually, if I wanted to be the point guard. Every other day it was \u2018you want to be the point guard? You want to be the point guard?\u2019 The first few times I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t mind bringing the ball up sometimes,\u2019 and he was like, \u2018no \u2014 do you want to be the point guard?\u2019 For me, I was kind of like, damn, it means I have to run the offense and set everybody up and be like the head of the snake. But I\u2019ve enjoyed it. I\u2019ve learned a lot. And I love playing the point.\u201d On the outside, things seemed further clouded after Philly traded up with Boston to get the No. 1 overall pick this year , to take Fultz. Would Fultz, a point guard in his one season at the University of Washington, wind up on the ball, or Simmons? Would they split time there? Who would be running the show? Fultz\u2019s shoulder injury has tabled that dilemma for now, but it\u2019s going to be hard to see Philly taking Simmons off the ball now, after his first three weeks. There seems to be no dilemma as far as Brown is concerned, even as he knew that \u201cmost of the basketball world thought we had lost our minds\u201d when the 76ers gave Simmons the ball. \u201cThere\u2019s always healthy (pre-Draft) debate,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd it should be. It\u2019s a significant decision . Significant. And I think, albeit early days, it\u2019s changed us, for sure. And I think it\u2019s changed him. I think that\u2019s who he is. It\u2019s all that \u2014 it\u2019s his personality, the skill package, and it\u2019s his mentality. And you combine all of those things, and you just had a gut feel. When I kept seeing him at LSU, he always wanted the ball. He and the point guard would collide. And then you just get to the stage where you say, okay, go ahead.\u201d Those of us who write and yak about the league have tried to come up with the apt comparison for Simmons and Embiid. Magic and Kareem? If so, the personalities have been reversed, Freaky Friday style \u2014 in this modern-day case, the point guard is the stoic one, while the big guy has the outsided personality. Embiid is the one who Tweets incessantly, talks smack, eggs on the home crowd, calls himself \u201cthe Process,\u201d and on and on. (Simmons says he\u2019s fine doing media, but \u201cI just don\u2019t like bad questions.\u201d) Embiid said that while he doesn\u2019t always think it should be his job to be the team\u2019s emotional leader (\u201cbecause it might get me in trouble in terms of getting technical fouls, and getting ejected from the game,\u201d he said) he thinks that he sometimes needs to do it because no one else will. And, indeed, that is not something Simmons is going to do. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely two different personalities,\u201d Embiid said of himself and Simmons. \u201cI\u2019m just being myself.\u201d Together, the two of them can be the vanguard of something new. There just has never been a point guard and center with the combo of size and wild athletic ability of Simmons and Embiid. And with Dario Saric at the four and Robert Covington at the three, Philly is ridiculously long. Perhaps we should stop comparing them to the past, and let Simmons and Embiid forge their own future path. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a different era,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI see a lot of people compare me to Hakeem [Olajuwon]. A lot of people compare me to, I don\u2019t know, when I do the running hook, Kareem. But it\u2019s so different. I feel like you can\u2019t compare to one of those guys. I\u2019m sure they could have stepped out and shoot the three, but back then it wasn\u2019t popular. I do a little bit of everything \u2014 I can playmake, shoot the three, post up. I think I\u2019m pretty good in the post, off the dribble. Sometimes it\u2019s not a fair comparison. \u201cBecause sometimes I also want to be the first Joel Embiid. I don\u2019t want to be Hakeem Olajuwon. I know that I shoot threes and he didn\u2019t shoot threes. I think he was the best post scorer ever. My post moves are not equal to his. But I think they\u2019re getting up there as I\u2019m getting better.\u201d Simmons has had to feed big guys since he was 15 and played at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), his home country\u2019s national feeder program for elite, Olympic-level athletes. (Simmons has pledged to play for Australia in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.) He only stayed at AIS briefly, though, before coming to the States to play high school basketball \u2014 his best path, he thought, to the NBA. He\u2019s quickly developed a chemistry with Embiid. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to play with certain people,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cAnd I had to learn his game and what he\u2019s good at, put him in the right positions and get him the ball where he needs it, to do his thing. I know he\u2019s a great player. For me, to help benefit the team, I\u2019ve got to put him in the right position and also do the right thing by myself and my teammates, and put them in the right positions. He gives me a lot of space on the floor, because it\u2019s tough to guard him. Guys are so concerned about him sometimes I\u2019m able to get a quick 10 points or whatever it is.\u201d There is still the question of Fultz, whose shoulder is starting to respond to treatment and therapy , and who will be back at some point in the next few weeks. \u201cWhen he comes back I know he wants to be the point guard, so that\u2019s something we have to figure out, who\u2019s the main ball handler,\u201d Embiid says. It is not an insignificant issue. Redick has been nails at the two guard, both as a spacer and at the defensive end, and the Sixers just gave Covington a $62 million extension because of his two-way excellence. But that is a question for later. Only one question remains for now, to the 21-year-old who handles everything thrown his way: if Ben Simmons had access to a working time machine, would he want to go back and play with his father and the Melbourne Tigers, or play against his father? \u201cPlay with him,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cThat would be awesome. I would know his game and I\u2019d be the point guard, so I could put him in the right position, make sure he\u2019s getting buckets.\u201d But, as Coach Brown said above, sometimes you have to get the ball to the guy who hasn\u2019t touched it in a while. Could you shake off Pops if someone else needed the rock? \u201cI could do that easily,\u201d Ben Simmons says, \u201cbecause I know I\u2019m going to score.

From Jason Maynard: That\u2019s been a low-pilot buzz around the Association for a little while, Jason, and Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com put it out there Friday that the Cavs would be \u201cwilling\u201d to move Tristan Thompson for Jordan. And, you hear that the Clippers have put feelers out to a handful of teams. It makes sense. DJ has this season at $22.6 million before his option year in 2018-19 at $24.1 million. If L.A. was to move Jordan, now would be the time. The Clippers clearly aren\u2019t a contender any more, and losing Patrick Beverley for the season only accentuates it. So why not move Jordan? He would certainly bring back a good haul; he still is immensely disruptive on screen and rolls, and protects the rim so well, he more than pays for his contract even if he\u2019s not a first option on offense (at least he\u2019s shooting 60 percent from the line this season , way, way up from previous Hack-a-DJ campaigns). Any contender could use him. Complicating matters, though, is that the Clippers are hard-capped this year, and cannot under league rules make any trade that puts them above the luxury tax apron for 2017-18 of $125.266 million after the trade. (Basketball Insiders\u2019 Eric Pincus puts L.A.\u2019s current team salary at $119.1 million.) That doesn\u2019t mean the Clippers can\u2019t make trades; they just can\u2019t do deals that put them over the apron afterward. A Thompson-Channing Frye combo for Jordan would work cap-wise, thought I\u2019m sure the Clippers would also strongly ask about that unprotected Brooklyn first the Cavs have in their back pocket \u2014 and be rebuffed. The devil would be in whether L.A thought Thompson, still springy to be sure at 26, was enough of a centerpiece (no pun intended) to pull the trigger. Milwaukee would certainly make sense in a potential Jordan deal, too. The Bucks still have John Henson and\/or Thon Maker up front after dealing Greg Monroe to Phoenix for Eric Bledsoe, and could package either with a Tony Snell to facilitate a trade with Los Angeles. No doubt the Clippers would surely ask about 2017 Kia Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon as well. As long as the Bucks are certain Jabari Parker will return to the lineup sometime after the All-Star break, moving another young big as part of a package for Jordan wouldn\u2019t be irresponsible. And can you imagine the defensive havoc that a Bledsoe-Giannis Antetokounmpo-Jordan triumvirate could wreak on the world? The Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors would be longer shots. Maybe the Wizards could get involved if they were willing to talk about Kelly Oubre along with Marcin Gortat (the Machine, at 33, remains durable, having missed eight games total in the last four-plus seasons) and filler for Jordan \u2014 the filler almost certainly including a future first-round pick. But with three max players on the books it\u2019s more likely the Wizards hoard their firsts in the foreseeable future to ensure a pipeline of young, cheap talent to add to their John Wall-Bradley Beal-Otto Porter core. Toronto doesn\u2019t look to have the assets to get Jordan, unless the Clippers were committed to playing small ball with Serge Ibaka at center for the next few years, and that looks like what the Raptors are leaning toward doing with Ibaka now. But, coach Dwane Casey is always going to be defense first, and Jordan is still elite at that end. All in for the 504. From Cory Morton: No one can doubt your Pelicans fervor, Cory, and they indeed had two great wins last week, so stick your chest out. Rondo\u2019s numbers don\u2019t jump off the screen, but he\u2019s so heady, and his past experience with DeMarcus Cousins in Sacramento makes him uniquely suited to recognize and deal with Boogie\u2019s mercurial nature better than just about anyone. Also, Rondo keeps the Pelicans organized and stable. It\u2019s a small sample size, but, no doubt, Rondo\u2019s return has helped. Impatience is not a virtue, but that ish is real. From Jordan Gehrung: Fair criticism, Jordan, considering the expectations that the Bucks had going into the season. The Bucks still have to turn opponents over and get multiple stops for their long and lean and wildly athletic group to maximize their skills. Defensively, it\u2019s not happening as the Bucks are 22nd in Defensive Rating (106.8) . Yet Milwaukee leads the league in fewest fast-break points allowed per game, at just 6.7 . So the Bucks\u2019 defensive issues are coming where they should be at their best \u2014 when they\u2019re set up and have everybody back. That\u2019s on Kidd; he and assistant Sean Sweeney pride themselves on making Milwaukee impregnable at that end. It\u2019s still hard for me, though, to see Kidd\u2019s star dimming under the Bucks\u2019 current ownership. He and his agent are just too tight and close with co-owner Marc Lasry to imagine Milwaukee souring on him. I love this question, and it\u2019s not just because the author is a proud graduate of The American University. From Chris Hill : You can find relatively inexpensive seats in just about every NBA arena, Chris. But because I don\u2019t have two days to go over every price of every ticket of every team in the league, I am going to short circuit the process here and eliminate the biggest (and likely, most expensive) markets \u2014 New York and Chicago and Golden State and Philly, etc. With that caveat, I think I\u2019d mosey up to Minneapolis and see what Karl-Anthony Towns, Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins were up to, Chris. They usually put out a very entertaining product. For $55 (I\u2019ll carry you on the extra $5) on cheaptickets.com, I found a pretty decent upper level seat at Target Center for Tuesday night\u2019s game between the Timberwolves and Wizards \u2014 not quite as compelling a matchup without John Wall on the floor, but still not bad.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (29 ppg, 5 rpg, 9.5 apg, .419 FG, .842 FT): At the quarter pole, he\u2019s running away and hiding for MVP. 2) LeBron James (26 ppg, 8 rpg, 8.7 apg, .549 FG, .706 FT):  From what I remember of the show , there is occasional singing, and the title character is an aardvark. This will be interesting plot development. 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (25 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 4.5 apg, .462 FG, .778 FT): Returned from a sore right knee to log 39 minutes in Salt Lake City Saturday night. 4) Kyrie Irving (31.3 ppg, 3 rpg, 4.5 apg, .595 FG, .852 FT): Love how my dude on the sideline report simply keeps telling his story while Irving puts Darren Collison in the spin cycle . That\u2019s discipline! 5) Kevin Durant (21 ppg, 5 rpg, 2 apg, .471 FG, 1.000 FT): If there is a God, KD and Russ will keep this going until they\u2019re old and gray, and may there be a camera present every single time. +57 \u2014 Plus-Minus score racked up by Houston\u2019s Luc Mbah a Moute last Wednesday against the Nuggets, a record per basketball-reference.com\u2019s database (which dates back to 2001) in a game the Rockets won by 30. Mbah a Moute played just 25 minutes and was 5 of 5 from the floor, including 3 of 3 on three-pointers, along with 4 rebounds and 4 steals. 25 \u2014 Rebounds needed by Charlotte\u2019s Dwight Howard to break into the NBA\u2019s top 20 all-time list in that category . Howard is 24 boards from tying the great Paul Silas (12,357) for 20th on the list. Currently third in the league in rebounding at 13.1 per game, Howard\u2019s current average puts him within striking distance of catching not just Silas this season, but Dikembe Mutombo (currently 19th, with 12,359 career rebounds), Charles Barkley (18th, 12,546), Bob Pettit (17th, 12,849), Jerry Lucas (16th, 12,942), Buck Williams (15th, 13,017) \u2014 and, uh, Shaquille O\u2019Neal (14th, 13,099). 13 \u2014 Consecutive wins, including their 4-0 first-round sweep in 2015 , by the Warriors over the Pelicans following Golden State\u2019s Durant-less victory in Oakland Saturday. New Orleans\u2019 last win over the Warriors came on April 7, 2015. 1) Nous saluons le retour, Monsieur Parker .  Tu nous as manqu\u00e9. 2) Congrats on the statue, Chuckster! \u201cSkinny Chuck\u201d will live forever. 3) Not only have I never seen anything like this in 30 years of covering basketball , I\u2019ve never seen anything remotely close to this in 30 years of covering basketball. I can\u2019t fathom how you\u2019d even attack a three-man defense, since it\u2019s not something you\u2019d even conceive as a possibility. Kudos to both Minnesota and Alabama for not making a mockery of the game. 4) Haven\u2019t laughed this loud in a long, long time. 5) The Inaugural Craig Sager Memorial Basketball Tournament at Dacula High School in Georgia last week was a great on-court success , with 32 teams taking part. Craig\u2019s children, Craig, Jr., and Kacy, worked ridiculous hours over the last eight months with Dacula\u2019s head basketball coach, Dr. Russ Triaga, in pulling the event off, with no corporate sponsors or big wheels underwriting the cost. So they still could use your assistance in retiring the costs associated with the tournament. If you loved watching Craig over the years, or you\u2019re a player that Craig interviewed postgame, or you just like reading this column every week, or you\u2019re anyone who can help, hit the Go Fund Me page and ensure that the Sager Kids and Coach Triaga can put this together again next year 1) RIP, Steve \u201cSnapper\u201d Jones, a great player for the Blazers and a great broadcaster with NBC when the Peacock had the national NBA contract. Listening to Snapper go back and forth with Bill Walton while Marv sat, bemused, at their patter was outstanding television. And Steve was just as gracious and good a person. My condolences to his family and friends. 2) If this is not the end for Derrick Rose, one sees the end just around the corner. Rose will never be MVP Rose again, but he cannot seem to shake the melancholy that has enveloped him the last few years, as injuries have denied him the chance even to be a good, contributing player. And that is not someone a contending team can count on. 3) My Summer League travels were always limited to Vegas , but everyone who ever went to the Orlando Summer League praised its intimacy and lack of glitz \u2014 the anti-Vegas, if you will. It was a tournament for hard-core hoops people (no tickets sold, no fans) associated with the league and its teams. The Magic, which had run the Orlando League since 2002, decided to end the tournament , as the Vegas League gobbled up all but a handful of teams (a record 24 NBA teams took part last July). It was a good run. 4) Yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that, while plenty strong, Kirk doesn\u2019t have the lateral quickness to stay in front of Russ, much less hit him upside the head . 5) Beyond sad , and, like this young man\u2019s father, I have little doubt that this is going to end badly. \u2014 Athletic trainer Tim Grover ( @ATTACKATHLETICS ), Saturday, 10:27 a.m., after the Warriors eviscerated Chicago Friday night \u2014 but by \u201cjust\u201d 49 \u2014 143-94. As Grover trained the likes of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade over the years, we\u2019ll take his word for understanding what it takes to be the best. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, if we got to square up, I\u2019m 7-2, I\u2019m a big dude, so I don\u2019t think you want to try me.

The Missouri freshman forward, a one-and-done lock, has generally been considered one of the top two incoming players in college basketball this season (along with Duke\u2019s Marvin Bagley III). Both are at the top of most NBA teams\u2019 current Draft boards. But Porter played just two minutes for the Tigers this season before being shut down for good, with the team announcing last week that the 6-foot-10 forward would have a microdiscectomy \u2014 removing some of the bone over the nerve root and disc material under the nerve root , to alleviate pain \u2014 and miss the rest of the season. As this is almost certainly his only season in college, NBA teams will have to rely solely on what they saw of Porter in high school and the AAU circuit to make Draft evaluations, assuming Porter, as expected, declares for the 2018 Draft.  Backs scare NBA types. They tend to linger throughout a player\u2019s career; once Larry Bird\u2019s back got jacked up, it didn\u2019t get better, no matter what treatment he tried. The same with Tracy McGrady and others who played despite the pain, year after year. The microdiscectomy, of course, is supposed to alleviate some of that pain. The uncertainty of how much Porter has been in, how much he\u2019ll be in and how much he\u2019ll be able to tolerate once he\u2019s banging in the paint or getting knocked down on drives, taking charges, etc., is what NBA scouts and executives can only guess at right now. I asked a dozen personnel people how concerned they were with Porter, Jr.\u2019s surgery and if it will impact where he\u2019s picked. The responses were mixed. \u201cIf it\u2019s a standard microdiscectomy, it shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue (lots of those procedures on NBA players),\u201d one general manager said Sunday via text. \u201cIf it\u2019s more than that, the result could be of greater impact. If he can do a few draft workouts, he should be just fine. It may play out like the (Joel) Embiid draft where Joel was affected by a couple picks (because of the foot), but not much beyond that.\u201d But another executive had a different view. \u201cNo doubt it hurts him,\u201d the exec said. \u201cObviously the medical evaluation will be more important and often times as we know, the agents with players at this level withhold information from most of the teams so it will be an interesting decision as to how they handle. Backs are like knees and serious foot\/ankle injuries. Tough ones.\u201d All will be watching to see how Porter, Jr.\u2019s rehab program is structured for clues about how soon he\u2019ll be back. \u201cIt depends obviously on the outcome of the procedure and level of rehab success,\u201d another GM said. \u201cBut it would take a real problematic situation to cause a big draft slip. He should stay well inside the Top 5.\u201d The top of the 2018 Draft looks potentially loaded, with Bagley, Arizona big man DeAndre Ayton and European wing Luka Doncic all expected to be taken high when and if they enter the Draft. No one I spoke with believes Porter, Jr, will fall out of the top five, though his position within the top five could slide a little. \u201cEvery team in the top 5 in the lottery will do their medical due diligence and see the potential long-term impact,\u201d another GM texted Sunday. \u201cThey will also compare his talent upside to the other top players in the draft. His lack of body of work could either hurt or help him based on how well Doncic, Bagley, and Ayton play throughout the year.\u201d Said another longtime personnel man: \u201che will still be a top five pick but might not go number 1 now. Almost like Embiid. If he were healthy, he would have been number 1 but with injury went 3. It depends where the gap is from top tier to next tier. If teams see 5 guys at the top he goes 5. If they see 3 guys he goes 3.\u201d And another: \u201cit\u2019ll be hard to take him #1, but unlikely he drops out of top 5 IMO.\u201d Another pro personnel man pointed out the injury will only make the input of higher-ups on a team even more acute. \u201cIf there are no complications and he makes a complete recovery, the surgery will not have any bearing on his draft position for me,\u201d the pro personnel man said. \u201cBut, I believe it will change how other people and ownership look at it.\u201d Porter posted a picture of an empty room on his Instagram feed Sunday , with a caption: \u201cJust letting y\u2019all know whoever said it was gonna take 3-4 months to recover lied\u201d with two smiley faces afterward. (Porter neglected to inform that the original prognosis was delineated by Missouri, in its original Tweet about his impending surgery .) https:\/\/www.seccountry.com\/missouri\/look-michael-porter-jr-publishes-curious-instagram-photo-will-make-missouri-fans-ache The immediate, fact-free speculation online Sunday night was that Porter was hinting at a possible return before the end of Missouri\u2019s season. But no one knows for sure. That\u2019s going to be a recurring theme when it comes to Porter and the NBA during the next seven months, before Draft night 2018. \u201cThis will be like any other injury,\u201d an assistant GM said. \u201cYou have to get as much information as possible and then determine if it is worth risk. However, back issues are generally more concerning than most. It\u2019s gonna come down to information, information, & more information.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Simmons driving 76ers\u2019 rise | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Your questions on DeAndre Jordan & more * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

For now, either move seems less and less probable because the Sixers would likely have to part with some of their prized future Draft picks. In short, the Sixers and Okafor remain in limbo.

He reports that Colangelo has dropped his asking price for Okafor from two first-round picks to a first-round pick and a solid player to a second-round pick. Still, the Sixers haven\u2019t been able to work out a trade for Okafor , which is frustrating the big man: As for the buyout talks, that seems to be of no interest to Colangelo, Wojnarowski reports.

Family members and friends confirmed Jones\u2019 death this evening following a lengthy illness. Funeral services will be announced soon by the Jones family. Jones played 64 games in a Trail Blazers uniform during the 1975-76 season, averaging 6.5 points per game in what would be his final year as a player. He was acquired by the Trail Blazers in October of 1975 for a sixth-round draft pick from the Golden State Warriors. The bulk of his pro career was spent in the American Basketball Association (ABA) where Jones was a three-time ABA All-Star and played for five franchises, including the San Antonio Spurs and Denver Rockets (now Nuggets) \u2013 both now teams in the NBA. His nine-year ABA\/NBA pro career spanned 704 games, with an impressive 15.2 points per game average. In more recent years, Jones carved a successful career as an NBA broadcaster, including providing color commentary for CBS Television when the Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers to win the 1977 NBA Championship. His broadcasting resume included work for ESPN\/ABC, TBS, TNT, Fox Sports Net, USA Network and NBC, where he was an analyst for the \u201cNBA on NBC\u201d for more than a decade. Jones was also part of numerous Trail Blazers broadcasting tandems, including Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame honoree Bill Schonely . \u201cSteve was as positive and good-natured a broadcasting partner as I could have had,\u201d said Schonely of Jones, who would be a broadcasting fixture with the Trail Blazers for 26 years. \u201cHe loved to call me \u2018Pops\u2019 as a nickname, and we worked very well together on Trail Blazers games during some of the early years of the franchise. He was a terrific guy.\u201d In March 2012, Jones was honored at center court of the then Rose Garden arena (now Moda Center) by the Trail Blazers for his years of service to the franchise as a player and broadcaster. Among his Trail Blazers broadcasting partners along with Schonely were Pat Lafferty, Pete Pranica, Mike Rice and Mike Barrett. Jones moved to Houston in 2008 where he resided until his death. As a collegiate player, Jones played for the University of Oregon from 1961-64, leading the team in scoring during the 1963-64 season. Born in Alexandria, Louisiana, but raised in Portland, Jones was a standout player locally at Franklin High School, leading his squad to an Oregon state championship in 1959.

Wall, 27, underwent an MRI exam, coach Scott Brooks revealed Friday following the day\u2019s practice session, which the point guard missed. The four-time All-Star will receive platelet-rich plasma and viscosupplementation injections in the hope of reducing the inflammation that has caused discomfort for the past two weeks. The injury occurred when Wall made knee-to-knee contact with another player during Washington\u2019s Nov. 7 loss to Dallas, according to the team statement. Wall, who averages 20.3 points and 9.2 assists, previously said fluid on his knee built up after he received IV fluids to deal with illness and migraines before the Wizards hosted Atlanta on Nov. 11. Wall sat out Sunday\u2019s 100-91 loss at Toronto, but returned to play his usual starting role in matchups against Milwaukee and Charlotte. He had 31 points and 11 assists over 41 minutes in Washington\u2019s 129-124 overtime loss to the Hornets on Wednesday, but then didn\u2019t participate in Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cHe\u2019s sore,\u201d Brooks said of Wall on Friday. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure we did some treatments and see how he feels.\u201d The Wizards (10-8) host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday. Dr. Richard D. Parker with the Cleveland Clinic Marymount was consulted about the injury. Parker performed a procedure in May 2016 to remove calcific deposits in Wall\u2019s left patella tendon. Washington is 1-1 this season without Wall, who also missed a game because of a shoulder injury. \u201cI\u2019m fine with John missing two weeks if this is going to make him better,\u201d center Marcin Gortat said Saturday. \u201cTwo weeks are not two months.

The Cleveland Cavaliers fit in the former group, as their new mostly black Statement jerseys are similar to the ones they wore in the championship-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. LeBron James told Cleveland.com on Friday that is just as fond of that symbolism as anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be a staple of this franchise forever,\u201d James said. \u201cBecause we won our first championship in franchise history in all black so, no matter who is in uniform here throughout the rest of eternity, I feel like the black will be incorporated, the black uniform with probably be incorporated in the grand scheme of things just for the memories.\u201d  Black proved to be a popular choice for the Statement line, even in the green-and-white empire that is Boston.

The Phoenix Suns also went with black, a hearkening to the black alternate jerseys they wore in mid-1990s. The \u201cPHX\u201d moniker is a more recent reference to their late 2000s orange alternates worn by Steve Nash, Amar\u2019e Stoudemire and others.  The Bulls also hearkened back to their 1990s glory days by going black, a look made even more popular by Michael Jordan & Co.\u2019s second three-peat.  The Atlanta Hawks differed in their jersey lineup, sporting black in their Icon edition while saving red for the Statement version. A fun extra in this one: the uniquely hawkish letter \u2018A\u2019 that gives the jersey an extremely franchise-specific feel.  The boldest Statement, however, might come courtesy of Oklahoma City. After toying around with large doses of sky blue and burnt orange in previous alternates, Nike and the Thunder to use both bold colors as accents while letting a thunder-esque new font do most of the talking. While OKC went conservative with bold colors, the Indiana took the opposite approach. Yellow\/gold has always been featured in the franchise\u2019s history, but the Pacers decided to double down on that color this time around. Another drastic difference: the circular use of the full team name around the jersey number instead of the straight\/arched\/slanted approaches we usually see.

And he certainly doesn\u2019t need the 3-pointer to continue to impact the Raptors positively. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to understand counters,\u201d said DeRozan, the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week . \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this my whole career, nine years, just studying angles and counters, opportunities of shot selections when I\u2019m inside that 3-point line. And with my counter moves, I\u2019m always ready for whatever they try to throw at me and how they try and stop me.\u201d That includes a healthy diet of studying his own game, both through film work throughout the season and on and off the court in the offseason. \u201cEverything comes into play, film and pick up ball, especially the offseason,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cBeing able to look at all my mistakes, being able to evaluate the things I could have done better offensively and just trying to master the craft and being a student of the game. I try to look at every miscellaneous thing that may go untouched or unnoticed and I try and tighten it up, and then add other things accordingly. And you can see it, you see the results in game time situations.\u201d Whatever his method, it\u2019s working for the Raptors. They\u2019ve integrated new faces like C.J. Miles and OG Anunoby without issue. And while All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry has needed a little more time to adjust to the wrinkles of Dwane Casey\u2019s new offense, DeRozan has been in a groove from the start. Before his 18-point effort in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the New York Knicks, DeRozan had scored 22 or more points in nine straight games. His consistency has been a driving force for a Raptors team in the midst of redefining itself offensively. And his leadership has been invaluable for a team that has quietly shoved its way back into the top four of the Eastern Conference standings behind Boston and Detroit and ahead of Cleveland, heading into tonight\u2019s game against Indiana ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass) . So what if they aren\u2019t the style darlings of the league, playing an up-tempo brand of basketball that captivates crowds from arena to arena. DeRozan said the Raptors are fine with where they fit in the landscape right now. \u201cWe understand we can\u2019t worry about what everybody else is thinking or saying, we\u2019ve got to worry about and focus on getting better with every opportunity we\u2019re given,\u201d DeRozan said, making sure to remind anyone that might have forgotten that just two seasons ago the Raptors were in the conference finals against LeBron James and the Cavaliers. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s all said and done, you count the teams who are standing at the end and go from there. As of right now, we don\u2019t worry about it. Let this be the time we find out about ourselves and continue grinding, because we\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 6 edition of the 2017-18  Kia Race to the MVP Ladder : Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats:  31.1 points, 9.8 assists, 4.9 rebounds While relative newcomers like Kyrie Irving and Giannis Antetokounmpo have garnered much of the early season MVP buzz, Harden has somewhat quietly gone about the business of maintaining his status as arguably the most unstoppable offensive force in the league. And he\u2019s done nothing but bolster his case for the No. 1 spot on this list for a Rockets team that is 9-1 in its last 10 games, tied with Irving\u2019s Celtics for the best mark in the league. Now that Chris Paul appears to be healthy and back in a groove, Harden might not have to shoulder as much of the responsibility of driving the Rockets as he has previously. His 21 points in Wednesday\u2019s rout of the Denver Nuggets was his lowest scoring outing this month. His 32 minutes against the Nuggets marked just the third time all season he\u2019s logged fewer than 33 minutes in a game. And he\u2019ll get an extra day of rest in advance of Saturday\u2019s visit from the New York Knicks.  Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  22.5 points, 5.2 assists, 2.1 rebounds The Celtics\u2019 win streak ended at 16 games Wednesday night in Miami, with both Irving and his coach, Brad Stevens, trying to provide some perspective on exactly where this team stands now. Steven insists his team is not as good as the streak suggests. Irving, though, is every bit the closer and clutch performer he showed himself to be during that stretch. That said, he knows better than anyone else on the roster just how important it is for the Celtics to move on from the streak and make sure that does not end up being the highlight of their season. Now that the bar has been raised, and his old team in Cleveland appears to have worked through some of their early season issues, the battle for supremacy in the Eastern Conference is really on. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  28.6 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds The world looks completely different now for LeBron and his Cavaliers on the other side of their current, league-leading six-game win streak heading into tonight\u2019s home game against Charlotte ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). Those stitches he needed to close up a gash in his lip in Wednesday\u2019s win over Brooklyn lit the flame for LeBron, who scored 24 fourth-quarter points to finish off the Nets. He\u2019s scored 30 or more points in three of his last four games and continues to dominate every night a jaw-dropping 15 seasons into his career. It\u2019s worth taking a moment to reflect on just how unbelievable it is for LeBron, just a little over a month away from his 33rd birthday, to still be far and away the best player in the game. You can wonder how long he\u2019ll be able to keep up this pace or stop debating about it and just appreciate the unprecedented nature of what he\u2019s doing. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  25.5 points, 6.5 assists, 5.2 rebounds The road wasn\u2019t particularly kind to Curry and the Warriors, as they were humbled both in Boston and Oklahoma City during their four-game cross country jaunt. Instead of serving notice to two teams with designs on blocking their path to a second straight Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, the Warriors were reminded that they are far from the team they expect to be come playoff time. A visit from a three-win Chicago Bulls team tonight at Oracle Arena ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) should be exactly what Curry and the Warriors need to get back on track after that ambush in Oklahoma City Wednesday night. Curry\u2019s had 13 assists and 13 turnovers in his past two outings, stagnant work in that regard from the player who makes the Warriors flow. He\u2019s as good as there is in the league when it comes to recognizing when he needs to take a step back and get back to his own basics. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 6 Season stats:  22.7 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.3 assists Don\u2019t let the personality and super-sized social media presence fool you. Embiid is in the spotlight these days first and foremost because of the on-court impact he\u2019s having on an upstart Sixers team. He\u2019s been unreal in some of the biggest moments for a young team still finding its way in the realm of playoff-caliber teams. Sure, he\u2019s not afraid to tell you exactly what he thinks. And he\u2019s more than willing to tell you he\u2019s going to beat up on you before doing so. But he\u2019s backing up all his tough talk with absolutely dominant performances whenever the Sixers need it, the Portland Trail Blazers being his latest victim (28 points on 11-for-19 shooting, 12 rebounds and two blocks in just 30 minutes). There\u2019s no telling what he has in store for the Orlando Magic Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. The next five: 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 7. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks 8. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 9. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 10. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers And five more \u2026: DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans; Tobias Harris, Detroit Pistons; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves; John Wall, Washington Wizards * * * A behind-the-scenes look at Tim Hardaway Jr. from an Eastern Conference executive: \u201cPeople had a whole lot to say about that contract the Knicks gave him. But it doesn\u2019t look so crazy right now. The guy has really been lights out so far. As good as Porzingis has been, and he\u2019s having a true breakout season himself, I\u2019d argue that Hardaway has been every bit as valuable to what they are doing here recently. What he did to the Raptors the other night (career-high 38 points in an impressive win) was special. In college he had moments like we\u2019ve seen out of him last season in Atlanta and certainly this season back in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s better than you think off the dribble and his handle has really improved. I think his time in Atlanta playing for Mike Budenholzer really helped change his game. He\u2019s not a great defender by any stretch, but he understands the concepts and knows you have to bring energy on that end, too. And given the position he plays, he won\u2019t be able to get by playing on one end and surviving. He\u2019s fearless, too, which I think might be his best quality. He\u2019s not afraid of the moment. That\u2019s in his DNA. Credit (Knicks coach) Jeff Hornacek for giving him the freedom to play the way he has. That\u2019s invaluable for a young talent, being allowed to play through some of the inevitable ups and downs. But the thing the Knicks have to feel really good about is how well he and Porzingis go together. Neither one of them is a finished product. Porzingis has an enormous ceiling. But Hardaway should be a nice player to have growing and continuing to develop his game alongside Porzingis. It\u2019s a good fit.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

I was at Quicken Loans Arena on opening night and had a terrific, horrific view of Gordon Hayward\u2019s ankle explosion. Beyond all the immediate concerns about Hayward, I almost instantly began to mourn the Eastern Conference for its lack of interest in a suddenly much longer regular season. Had Boston slid to mediocrity without Hayward, the Cavaliers would have been able to fiddle around for 81 games before getting serious and it all would have been pretty boring. But by roaring back with their most unlikely winning streak, the Celtics set a tone for the conference, serving notice to its playoff aspirants that this need not be predictable and snoozy. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m thankful the NBA isn\u2019t dealing with issues that are currently chipping away at the armor of other pro sports. The NFL right now is wallowing in a muck of concussions, players kneeling for the anthem, Colin Kaepernick, a depletion of great quarterbacks and Roger Goodell. Baseball is still trying to distance itself from steroids and how that era damaged the game\u2019s history and disrupted the Hall of Fame process. Meanwhile, all the NBA gets is the occasional fingernail scratch against the blackboard from LaVar Ball. John Schuhmann :  I\u2019m thankful for all the young talent there is in the league right now, giving us reasons to watch every night, even though we know what team is going to be winning the championship in June. We already had Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Kristaps Porzingis and Karl-Anthony Towns. Now, we have a rookie class with a ton of depth and talent, from top picks like Ben Simmons and Jayson Tatum to second rounders like Jordan Bell and Dillon Brooks. And there are other young guys, like Aaron Gordon and Spencer Dinwiddie, who have shown a lot of improvement. Seeing the potential and development of young players and young teams makes us temporarily forget the inevitability of another Warriors title.  Sekou Smith :  Joel Embiid and \u201cThe Process.\u201d Sure, that phrase was a punchline as recently as training camp before the start of the 2016-17 season. We hadn\u2019t yet seen Embiid in action and Ben Simmons wasn\u2019t collecting triple-doubles. But based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, there\u2019s more than enough reason to believe. And in a regular season that was supposed to be little more than a bland appetizer for Warriors-Cavaliers IV, Embiid and the Sixers have injected some much-needed juice into the game. There\u2019s also the new school of freaky young giants (Giannis Antetokounmpo, Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic and Kristaps Porzingis are also enrolled) ready to bring the big man back. But, Embiid gets it. He\u2019s got the splendid inside-out game to one day be the most dominant force in the league. He has the wit and quick tongue to dominate the social-media landscape that has become equally important to players and fans. Thank Naismith for the surprise that is the continued evolution of Joel Embiid and \u201cThe Process.\u201d"},{"id":43044,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-nba-thanksgiving-tony-rock","date":"2017-11-23","title":"Hang Time Podcast: NBA Thanksgiving with Tony Rock","content":"Listen on Apple Podcasts | Listen on iHeart Radio Comedian Tony Rock joins Greg Anthony and me to talk NBA, comedy and more as we look back at the NBA things we\u2019re thankful for this season.

But their Thanksgiving turkey will be that much tastier after Harrison Barnes banked in a 30-footer at the buzzer to negate JaMychal Green\u2019s go-ahead putback on the previous possession and stun the Grizzlies. DIFFICULTY: From one perspective, Barnes\u2019 degree of difficulty was zero. With only :00.5 on the clock for the final possession, there was no choice but to turn and heave off Dennis Smith Jr.\u2019s entry pass. Actually making such a shot, however, is a different story \u2014 especially with a defender\u2019s hand in your face, as was the case in the person of Grizzlies forward Dillon Brooks. GAME SITUATION: Down 18 early in the third quarter, the Mavericks stormed back to lead by five with 1:10 remaining. But the Grizzlies pushed the Mavs to the brink of yet another disappointment, tying the game on Marc Gasol\u2019s 3 and then seemingly winning it as Green swooped in to slam home a missed shot by Tyreke Evans with less than a second left. Green\u2019s bucket came this close to basket interference, but was correctly upheld by replay officials. Those same officials added two tenths of a second to the clock, giving Barnes just enough time to launch the winner. CELEBRATION: The Mavericks vented a season\u2019s worth of frustration as they mobbed the jubilant Barnes at midcourt. GRADE: Even after Wednesday\u2019s miracle, the Mavericks still occupy last place in the Western Conference. But for one night, at least, the ball finally bounced \u2014 or banked, rather \u2014 their way. Four Horrys.

He\u2019s still just 22 for a couple more weeks. OK, so he wouldn\u2019t qualify as a \u201csurprise\u201d MVP, I get it. That wipes out a bunch of young players with obvious All-NBA chops, from Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons to Kristaps Porzingis and Devin Booker. So I\u2019ll take a deep dive here and go with Chicago\u2019s Zach LaVine. He\u2019s got all the physical ability he needs (assuming his rehab from ACL surgery goes as planned), he\u2019s had time now to learn the game\u2019s fine points and he\u2019ll have a great market in which to showcase his skills, with an organization desperate for some star power. Shaun Powell :  I really don\u2019t think any young unheralded player \u2014 seriously KG, Thon Maker? \u2014 has thrown down that gauntlet just yet. And I can\u2019t recall the last time we\u2019ve had a \u201csurprise\u201d MVP to that degree, if that\u2019s ever happened before. But for the sake of playing along, I\u2019ll go with Kyle Kuzma, the 27th pick and less heralded of the Lakers\u2019 first-round picks last summer. Remember, key word is surprising, which rules out Giannis Antetokounmpo. John Schuhmann : Bruno Caboclo would be a \u201csurprising\u201d MVP, given that he\u2019s still the 15th man on the roster in his fourth season. But maybe the question is about a player in which I\u2019m the only one who sees MVP potential? Not sure that player exists, as most people see that in guys like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kristaps Porzingis, Karl-Anthony Towns, and even Nikola Jokic. Boston has a couple of guys \u2013 Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum \u2013 who might be in the conversation five or more years from now. Each of them can eventually score 20-plus points per game, while making an impact in other ways. But both were No. 3 picks, so I\u2019m not sure you can file them under \u201csurprising\u201d either.  Sekou Smith : I admire Mr. Area 21\u2019s bold take on Thon Maker. KG certainly knows a thing or two about getting his hands on a Kia MVP. But the premise here is pretty broad when you think of someone surprising us as a future candidate for basketball\u2019s most prestigious individual (regular season) honor. Since we\u2019re going off the grid for this one, projecting an uncertain future for so many, I\u2019ll go with my man Devin Booker in Phoenix . I know it\u2019s hard to see it now, what with the dumpster fire the Suns are trying to put out right now. And Booker has plenty of work to do on his game. The skills, though, are there. The profile to be an elite performer in today\u2019s NBA is already set. Again, I know we\u2019re projecting here. But did you see two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry coming?

What is ailing them most and how would you fix it?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Since they can\u2019t re-acquire Chris Paul, the missing link, I think the Clippers are living that particular NBA hell of being stuck in the middle. Not good enough to contend, not bad enough to sink completely to the bottom for lottery salvation. The free agent market of 2018 isn\u2019t going to be deep enough to save them, so I think they\u2019re looking at a full rebuild. Trade Blake Griffin, shed salaries and \u2014 with the Lakers in hot pursuit of relevancy by next season \u2014 slide into the up-and-coming role in that NBA marketplace. The path they\u2019re on will get them nowhere. Shaun Powell :  There are serious leadership problems that left with Chris Paul and there\u2019s no fixing or replacing that anytime soon. I\u2019ll give the Clippers a bit of a pass because of injuries, but this team looks rudderless especially in crunch time. But I\u2019m getting nervous for coach Doc Rivers. John Schuhmann : The first and most obvious problem, one that affects them on both ends of the floor, is that they no longer have Chris Paul. But the Clippers rank last defensively over the course of the streak , so I\u2019d start there. They\u2019ve fouled too much and haven\u2019t protected the rim very well. Patrick Beverley (and his ability to stay in front of ball-handlers) was missed in five of those nine games, but their problems go beyond that. Offensively, without (Paul and) Milos Teodosic, there\u2019s clearly too much burden on Blake Griffin\u2019s shoulders, because the 33 percent he has shot over the last seven games is the worst shooting stretch of his career and the defense has been at its worst with him on the floor . So injuries have been a factor, but they have to find a way (as other teams have) to get past them. It\u2019s hard to give them a pass on Danilo Gallinari\u2019s absence, because they chose to give $65 million to a guy who has missed 71 games over the last three seasons.  Sekou Smith : It\u2019s one thing to lose a future Hall of Fame point guard like Chris Paul and have to replace not only his production but also his leadership. Then to lose Milos Teodosic after two games and, later, Patrick Beverley for five games, compounding your issues, has to make coach Doc Rivers wonder what he did to deserve his current situation. The Clippers are in the middle of a mess right now and the only way out of it is to get healthy and to get back on the right side of winning. If they can\u2019t handle the lowly Atlanta Hawks tonight at Philips Arena it could spell trouble, as seven of the Clippers\u2019 next 12 games are on the road. That early season flash where Blake Griffin looked rejuvenated and they looked like they would manage the post-Paul era with ease vanished seemingly overnight."},{"id":48451,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/portland-trail-blazers-damian-lillard-praises-philadelphia-76ers-growth","date":"2017-11-22","title":"Damian Lillard says Philadelphia 76ers deserving of 'respect' this season","content":" For the first time since 2012-13, the Philadelphia 76ers are over .500 after 16 games.

And so, Russell Westbrook found himself fidgety on a fishing boat with Paul George. This very important story about sacrifice and bro bonding starts there. George is at peace with a vest, tackle box and a rod. This would probably be his day job if only he could make $25 million a year reeling bass. As a kid, he became hooked on the catch-and-release almost as quickly as the catch-and-shoot jumper. George and his father were a duo until the neighborhood kids joined in, to the point where the son borrowed a line from \u201cJaws\u201d and suggested they\u2019re gonna need a bigger boat . \u201cOne reason why I love fishing with my father,\u201d said George, \u201cis because it\u2019s a way to get to know one another better. Just us on a lake together.\u201d Westbrook is a feet-on-the-soil guy himself, who wasn\u2019t raised in the LA suburbs like George, but inside the city where \u2014 contrary to the NBA team he worshipped as a kid \u2014 there are no lakes. Westbrook\u2019s game away from the game is poker, and he is seriously good at it, according to industry types, which is odd for someone who gives anything but a stone face after one of his volcanic tomahawk dunks. But on this day, his first with a pole and bait, Westbrook took one for the team, for the sake of the Oklahoma City Thunder. And while he was pleasant enough company, George sized him up quickly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit Russ, you know?\u201d said George. \u201cI don\u2019t think Russ can fake that. He\u2019s not a fisherman. It\u2019s just not his thing.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter. This boat trip late last summer had a purpose and reason and so Westbrook was totally on board, so to speak. \u201cI\u2019ve never been fishing before so, you know, it\u2019s always a good thing to build a team bond and figure out what other guys like to do,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cObviously Paul likes fishing, so that\u2019s what we did. We might go again.\u201d And what did you catch? \u201cNothing,\u201d said Westbrook. Then the hyper-competitive Westbrook was quick to add: \u201cHe didn\u2019t either.\u201d And where was the third member of this collection of future Hall of Famers pasted together last summer to send a shiver from here to the Bay Area? Contrary to the somewhat faulty perception of the NBA\u2019s fourth-leading active scorer, Carmelo Anthony did pass. He was busy transitioning from New York to OKC (speaking of tricky exits from one\u2019s comfort zone). While the brotherhood was off to a curious start, here\u2019s an update: Westbrook, George and Anthony are hard at work getting their act together with the Thunder, emphasis on together . \u201cThose two guys,\u201d said Westbrook, who has warmed up quickly to the newcomers, \u201care making it easier for everyone.\u201d If anything during the first month of the NBA season, Westbrook, George and Anthony have been too sensitive about stepping on toes and egos. This is understandable given the mutual respect and the collective determination to make this situation succeed because of the somewhat dire circumstances. Unlike other assembled super teams, the Thunder lack the luxury of time. The whole experiment can blow up next summer from free agency. Therefore, they\u2019d rather go atomic this season \u2014 just in case. There\u2019s lots on the line and little on the clock, given the urgency and the reputations of three stars who\u2019ve earned everything except an NBA championship. To chug champagne next June, they\u2019ll need good health and maybe a witch doctor to hex the Golden State Warriors. Those are beyond their control. What\u2019s within their grasp is how well, and quickly, they mesh and give themselves a chance come springtime. Westbrook, Anthony and George are three lead singers who need to be a barbershop triplet and harmonize the right verse. They insist this will not be an issue. \u201cWe all know what each individual can and can\u2019t do on the court,\u201d said George. \u201cI know how special Russ is, how special \u2018Melo is. As much as they\u2019re scorers, they\u2019re also playmakers. They\u2019re going to get us the shot. There\u2019s no awkward moments, no, \u2018Hey, I was open.\u2019 We all know when the other\u2019s open and we try to make the best play, regardless of who makes it.\u201d  That OKC is 7-9 despite ranking No. 3 in Defensive Rating is a mild irritant, a necessarily rocky ritual that others ( see LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh with the Miami Heat ) also experienced at the start while folks screamed red alert. The OKC Three do need to polish their clutch chemistry as the Thunder are 0-4 in games decided by five points or less. When this formula gets right, the specs could be scary as this group unites the reigning Kia MVP (Westbrook) , an unselfish two-way star (George) and a lethal isolation scorer (Anthony), all still in different stages of their prime. Plus, OKC won 48 games in 2016-17 with only Westbrook at the controls. Undoubtedly, much of the burden rests with Westbrook. This remains his team, his town and he\u2019s the only one guaranteed to return next season after inking a five-year extension . How chilly would that be if he\u2019s on an island without Anthony, who can opt-out of his contract, and George, who\u2019s an unrestricted free agent? Westbrook needs to shatter a prickly perception that he\u2019s partly the reason Kevin Durant fled two summers ago for Golden State. Whether that\u2019s true or not, the idea of Westbrook using this season with Anthony and George to emphasize how good a teammate he is for anyone \u2014 and especially for a fellow All-Star or two \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched. He\u2019s making room for two additional stars, giving shots, minutes, spotlight, anything to win and keep the red carpet unfurled for them. To date, Westbrook\u2019s scoring average ( 19.9 points per game ) in 2017-18 is down 11.7 points per game from his 31.6 ppg in 2016-17 . \u201cRuss is our leader,\u201d George said. \u201cHe wants to make sure everybody is comfortable and on board, been that way since the day I stepped on the floor with him. It was, \u2018What can I do for you?\u2019 He\u2019s a true point guard in terms of wanting everyone around him to feel connected and be a part of something.\u201d Westbrook remains hot-wired and locked in pit-bull mode. Yet, he has never been more accommodating than now, unlike last season when he historically dropped triple-doubles (almost out of necessity in that first year without Durant). It\u2019s little things, like Westbrook not being the last Thunder starter introduced during games (an honor usually reserved for the franchise player). \u201cThat\u2019s a part of my job, to make sure those guys can come here and be themselves,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThey\u2019re great players. My job is to make sure they\u2019re comfortable in their spots and comfortable doing things that best benefits their game. They\u2019ll look at me and I\u2019ll give them the look that tells them to shoot it. \u201cIt\u2019s a process and a long season and we\u2019re figuring out what works best and where guys like the ball. We\u2019re getting a better sense of that now. We\u2019re not worried about who shoots what and when. Whoever has it going that\u2019s where the ball\u2019s going. The game will tell you what to do.\u201d Westbrook\u2019s efficiency is suffering as a result. He\u2019s shooting a career-worst 39.4 percent, perhaps because he doesn\u2019t dominate the ball as much. This whole process starts with Thunder coach Billy Donovan. To him, this is a collaboration, which shows how much respect Donovan has for his three stars who have earned the right to audible. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most experience with Russell with that and he has been phenomenal,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThere are times things he sees matchup wise he feels he can exploit and that\u2019s fine. If Paul\u2019s got something and has the ability to put the ball on the floor and create, I\u2019m not going to say, \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that\u2019 cause he\u2019s great at it, same with Carmelo. \u201cThere\u2019s a balance to that as a coach. I don\u2019t think you can let them do that all the time, and I also don\u2019t think you can\u2019t not let them do that none of the time because those guys are special players. You can\u2019t box them into a system where their own individual talent can\u2019t flourish.\u201d Anthony finds the Thunder a refreshing change from the dysfunction he wallowed in the last few seasons with the New York Knicks. Still, it wasn\u2019t an easy departure because Anthony, despite it all, loved playing in New York. He connected with the culture, the tabloids, the demands and the trappings \u2014 and the city loved him back. But the Knicks also took the best years of his career and never leveraged that into a championship or even sustained respectability. Anthony is done blaming ex-team president Phil Jackson and the insistence on the triangle offense for those shortcomings \u2014 although others won\u2019t surrender so easy. His college coach and confidant, Syracuse\u2019s Jim Boeheim, still burns.  \u201cCarmelo was professional about it \u2014 unlike other people \u2014 and played as good as he could play in that system,\u201d said Boeheim. \u201cThe coach (Jeff Hornacek) wasn\u2019t allowed to coach. It\u2019s different when you watch the Knicks play this year because they actually run plays. You got to let the coach coach the team his way. Mike Krzyzewski is a good coach and even he couldn\u2019t go to New York and coach the triangle.\u201d When the trade went down, Boeheim dialed Donovan and told the former college coaching rival that Anthony, who agreed to play power forward, would blend well with Westbrook and George. Boehiem was an assistant coach on Krzyzewski\u2019s USA Basketball team staff and said there\u2019s no downside, no peril to putting together stars. \u201cWe had guys who try to score: [James] Harden, [Kyrie] Irving, Durant, LeBron [James], all on the court on the same time. They work through that. Having good players is a good thing. It\u2019s never a bad thing, never a problem. You gotta have two or three who can score if you gonna win a championship.\u201d Donovan had a collegiate Dream Team on those Florida squads that won back-to-back titles in 2006 and \u201907. He also had experience with Westbrook and KD, and had no qualms about Anthony. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to take an approach that regardless what happened in the past with anybody, you build a relationship with that person,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest scorers but there\u2019s so much more to the game. He\u2019s had a real strong mentality going into camp, trying to be better and put himself in position to make other guys better. Those are the things that stood out to me since he\u2019s been here.\u201d Anthony is leaning on his vast Team USA experience to recall how to connect with teammates who are his equal or better. Admittedly, though, the dynamic is a bit different with only three big names instead of 12. \u201cWe\u2019re building a trust level,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the USA team we\u2019re all just out there. Here, you see things a bit different differently. We all talk, the communication is very high. We pick our spots. I let Russ do what he has to do to get himself going, same with Paul.\u201d Anthony is aware of both his basketball biological clock and the outside whispers that he can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) supply enough defense or intangibles to make a difference \u2026 and he scoffs at that. He agrees, though, that this is his best chance at a ring. Reminded that he can escape his contract next summer (though he\u2019d have to blowtorch $28 million for \u201818-19), he says something that hints toward the future: \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started here.\u201d George has influenced OKC\u2019s suddenly-sturdy defense while shooting 41 percent on 3-pointers shooting to maintain his rep as a two-way weapon. He\u2019s the most efficient scorer of the three \u2014 his True Shooting percentage ( 56.7 ) edges Anthony ( 53.6 ) and Westbrook ( 48.7 ) \u2014 and his breezy personality hardly dominates the locker room. He\u2019s respectfully deferential to Westbrook. At the season\u2019s low point \u2014 a road loss to Denver that gave OKC its fourth straight loss \u2013 George saddled up next to Westbrook following a team meeting . \u201cI asked him what he wanted from me. Then I did what he asked of me. I\u2019ve been aggressive and looked for my shot. There\u2019s no more guessing,\u201d George said. \u201cAt the beginning of the season everything was so new. I felt like a rookie again.\u201d Westbrook said: \u201cWhen he plays aggressive and plays his game he\u2019s capable of doing it every single night and we\u2019re encouraging him to do that each and every game. He\u2019s a guy who wants to win, sacrifice what he needs to help us to make sure we\u2019re a good team.\u201d Because he\u2019s not the volume scorer Westbrook and Anthony are by nature, this transition has been relatively pain-free for George. Still, he must learn his cue during crunch time like the rest. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Russ is ready and \u2018Melo too. Outside of us, we\u2019ve got guys who bring great depth. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far off. We\u2019ve made steps in the right direction, like becoming a better defensive team. We\u2019re poised to win a title.\u201d Some folks in Oakland might respond to George\u2019s claims with: Oh, really? When Warriors forward Draymond Green saw OKC and Houston adding stars last summer, he told GQ \u201ceverybody is just in a [expletive] panic about what to do\u201d and that \u201cthey know they don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d To that, George retorts, \u201cDraymond\u2019s always going to look for attention. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything else. But teams are going to look to get better. And they understand what the Warriors are doing with multiple stars on the court.\u201d The big question about George, 27, is his future; raise your hand if you have him pegged for a homecoming next fall with the Lakers. Understand this, though: George isn\u2019t the big-city guy you think he is (he fishes, remember). \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve been happy,\u201d George said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy.\u201d Like Anthony, George planted roots in OKC with a charity event; Anthony fed the hungry while George held a (what else) fishing outing with 45 OKC public school kids, to get them outdoors and away from video games. As he did with Westbrook, George had to convert the neophytes and show them what they\u2019re missing. \u201cFor a lot of the kids it wasn\u2019t just their first time fishing, it was their first time on a boat,\u201d said George. \u201cThey were scared. They were all hugging up on me and holding me tight, to the point where I thought, man, if I go down, we\u2019re all going down.\u201d Now that introductions are finally behind them, OKC is anxious to see what\u2019s about to go down with this trio.

That\u2019s how Markieff Morris sees it anyway, after witnessing the departures of Goran Dragic, Isaiah Thomas and his twin brother Marcus and then experiencing it for himself at the league\u2019s trade deadline in February 2016. Now it\u2019s Eric Bledsoe\u2019s turn. The former Phoenix Suns point guard will play at Talking Stick Resort Arena Wednesday ( 9 ET on League Pass ) for the first time since his rancorous final days with the team, and he\u2019ll do so as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks. In Morris\u2019 mind, there was no other way for Bledsoe to leave the Suns than awkwardly and unhappily. \u201cOh hell no. No way. Because everybody exits like that,\u201d Morris, Washington\u2019s starting power forward, said after the Wizards\u2019 99-88 victory over the Bucks Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a recurring thing in Phoenix, man. It\u2019s unfortunate, but you move on. You live. You learn.\u201d Bledsoe, who approached All-Star status during his four full seasons in Phoenix, unceremoniously departed with a thud earlier this month after separating himself in spirit via, of all things, social media. His Tweet after the Suns\u2019 0-3 start (\u201cI Don\u2019t wanna be here\u201d) was enough to convince general manger Ryan McDonough, who first coach Earl Watson and informed Bledsoe and interim replacement Jay Triano that the guard would not participate in games, practices or other functions. The estrangement lasted 16 days until McDonough traded Bledsoe to Milwaukee on Nov. 7 for big man Greg Monroe and protected first- and second-round draft picks in 2018. The sturdy 6-foot-1 point guard has been with the Bucks for two weeks now, helping them go 4-0 in his initial appearances before dropping a pair of lackluster performances at Dallas Saturday and against Washington. Bledsoe, late Monday, was careful not to say anything to enflame the situation in Phoenix. But the smile that crept across his face a couple of times \u2013 first when he brought up the return game, then when asked more directly about it \u2013 made it clear this would not be just one of 82. \u201cEverybody knows what happened. The situation that went down,\u201d Bledsoe said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to come out and play my game and not worry about nothing else.\u201d As for the booing that seems inevitable \u2013 at 7-11 overall, Phoenix is nearly .500 since he last played there \u2013 Bledsoe said: \u201cI mean, who knows? I love the fans. I hope they love me back. But you know how that goes. I love my teammates who I played with while I was there. I\u2019m gonna just focus on the game. I\u2019ve got great [Bucks] teammates who have my back.\u201d The soon-to-be-28-year-old (his birthday is Dec. 9) has posted averages not far off his career marks: 12.2 points, 4.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists. His defensive energy and impact have been good. But his shooting has been down \u2013 36.1 percent overall, 16.0 percent from the arc and even 73.9 from the line \u2013 and the Bucks have hit less than 28 percent of their 3-pointers four times in his six appearances. For now, they\u2019re not troubled by the trend but they do need to perk up as they begin a protracted four-game trip out West, starting in Phoenix and ending Nov. 30 at Portland. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to run. Just have fun,\u201d Bledsoe said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re not having fun a little bit right now. That\u2019s the biggest thing. We\u2019ve got to loosen up a little bit. I think we\u2019re a little uptight.\u201d Bledsoe knows the Bucks are built around versatile Giannis Antetokounmpo and that his role is to provide a complement to the offense that budding star creates. \u201cI\u2019m with a talented group of guys who can also make plays,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve got to try to find my game a little bit. It takes time.\u201d In adding Bledsoe, the Bucks shifted last year\u2019s Rookie of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon, into a supporting role. So they have a learning curve to match the new guy\u2019s. \u201cJust knowing your teammates\u2019 tendencies, knowing a new offense \u2013 it is kind of like adding a new quarterback,\u201d Bucks resident old head Jason Terry said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn a new system on the fly, and that\u2019s tough. You\u2019ve got to learn your new teammates. \u2018Where do they like the ball at?\u2019 And the last thing comes yourself. \u2018Where can I get the ball and be more effective?\u2019\u201d Virtually no one on either side Monday night doubted Bledsoe will have the desired impact in time. The Bucks already play faster with him aboard, and 4-2 is better than the 4-6 mark that greeted him. Besides Morris, who calls Bledsoe \u201cmy guy\u201d and \u201cthe ultimate competitor,\u201d there was John Wall. Wall, the Wizards\u2019 star point guard, teamed with Bledsoe at Kentucky in their one collegiate season, 2009-10. As pros, in 12 head-to-head outings, Bledsoe actually has better numbers. He has averaged 16.3 points in 27.9 minutes to Wall\u2019s 20.1 in 38 minutes. The Washington guard has the edge in assists, 9.1 to 4.5, but Bledsoe has outshot him 45 percent to 38 percent. Bledsoe\u2019s teams have won seven of the 12 meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s been funny,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe know each other\u2019s tendencies, we\u2019ve been practicing against each other for years. When we\u2019re competing, we\u2019re talking junk to each other, trying to outdo the next guy, going back and forth.\u201d There figures to be a lot of junk talked Wednesday night in the Valley of the Sun, with Bledsoe\u2019s return. When Morris went back to face the Suns for the first time, he did so on April 1, 2016. So his Wizards teammates took the occasion \u2013 April Fool\u2019s Day \u2013 to hang a Phoenix jersey in his visiting dressing stall, with his old Suns name plate and orange sneakers overhead. He wound up scoring 21 points with nine rebounds and four blocked shots in a Washington victory, and shrugged off the boos. \u201cYou could see how I played,\u201d Morris said that night. \u201cIt don\u2019t affect me. I\u2019ve been booed 100,000 times way worse than that.\u201d Morris believes Bledsoe will have the last laugh too, if not on Wednesday then eventually. The $10,000 the organization fined him for his Tweet could end up being a smart investment. \u201cHe got up out of there,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI mean, sometimes it takes that to get somewhere you want to be. You pay a couple dollars \u2026 you might get it back. Playoff money, just that alone.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In fact, if were up to some of the folks you\u2019ll hear from in this series, the league would\u2019ve never adopted it at all. Take Denver Nuggets great Alex English for example, who played for one of the highest scoring teams in the 1980s. In a record-scoring game between his Denver Nuggets and the Detroit Pistons , in which the two teams combined for 370 points, only four 3-pointers were attempted in that game. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. The 3-pointer has completely changed the game, and in today\u2019s NBA it has become imperative to not only utilize it, but to do so effectively as a team. That is of course, if you want to have any chance whatsoever to win a championship. After all, could you imagine the Golden State Warriors shooting mid-range shots all night?  And how about the bigs? Remember them? Long gone are the back-to-the-basket days of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the finesse in the paint shown by the likes of Hakeem Olajuwon, or the unstoppable force inside that was Shaquille O\u2019Neal. No, now we\u2019re watching the tallest guys on the floor shooting from its deepest spots. From the second it was embraced, the 3-pointer has gone through many trials and tribulations \u2026 but there\u2019s no denying its ever growing place in history. During the course of this five-part series, we share the story, from altering coaching philosophies to advancing analytics, to changing the big man forever.

They\u2019re 11-2 after leading by 15-plus (and almost blew a 28-point lead in Brooklyn on Sunday), having gone 184-2 in those situations over the previous three seasons. Last Monday, the New York Knicks lost a game (to Cleveland) they led by 23. On Friday, the Oklahoma City Thunder also lost a game (in San Antonio) they led by 23, while the Detroit Pistons lost a game (in Indiana) they led by 22. That same night, three more teams \u2013 the Clippers, Hornets and Mavs \u2013 lost games they led by double-digits and the Miami Heat almost blew a 25-point lead in Washington. On Saturday, the Warriors came from 24 points down to beat the Sixers. With more 3-pointers being attempted every year, scores \u2013 from game to game and quarter to quarter \u2013 could be more volatile. If one team catches fire while the other goes cold, things can change more rapidly than when three of every four shots came from inside the arc. Teams have still won 77 percent of the games they led by 10 or more points this season. That\u2019s the same winning percentage for teams up 10-plus five seasons ago and only down slightly from 10 seasons ago (79 percent). There\u2019s more of an uptick in comebacks from 20 or more points down. Teams have already won seven games that they\u2019ve trailed by 20-plus (seven different teams have done it), on pace to win 35 or 36 over a full season. Five years ago, there were only 16 wins from teams that trailed by 20 or more points. Ten years ago, there were 19. So don\u2019t turn that dial when a team goes up big. Things can swing in the other direction pretty quickly.

They\u2019re playing a 19-year-old rookie (Jayson Tatum) and a 21-year-old player in his second season (Jaylen Brown), on a team with eight new players on it \u2014 and yet they sit at the top of the league in Defensive Rating (95.9) , in opponent field goal percentage (43.0) and points allowed (94.4) . And they haven\u2019t lost in a month. (It\u2019s a measure of the historical standing of the Boston franchise that their 15-game win streak, which they\u2019ll put on the line tonight in Dallas, is only the fifth-best in Celtics history .) Yet in the midst of the wins, big and small \u2014 Golden State (big) on Thursday , Atlanta (small) on Saturday \u2013 Celtics coach Brad Stevens is driven to distraction. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d Stevens said Saturday morning in Atlanta, when I asked him about his team having to rely on its defense at present to win games. \u201cAnd we know that. We can\u2019t get caught up in the results of all these games and ride that emotion. We\u2019ve been fortunate to win a lot of these games in this streak, including Thursday night. And if we dig ourselves a 17-point hole every other game, it\u2019s not going to be as much fun as we\u2019ve had recently.\u201d Stevens isn\u2019t just being coachy. Boston\u2019s offense comes and goes. The Celtics are 27th in the NBA in field goal percentage . Even though they shoot a whole bunch of 3-pointers \u2014 30.5 per game, 11th in the league \u2014 they\u2019re not making nearly as many as they\u2019d like. And Boston\u2019s bench scoring is almost nonexistent at present. Marcus Smart is shooting a ghastly 27.3 percent and Terry Rozier is at 34.4 percent . Gordon Hayward is out for the year, of course, and Kyrie Irving is playing with a broken bone in his face. But, they haven\u2019t lost in a month, because their defense is insanely good. Boston has several players \u2014 backup center Aron Baynes, Smart, Brown, Rozier, starting center Al Horford and Tatum among them \u2014 in the top 20 in Defensive Rating , per NBA.com\/Stats. And in the middle of it are Brown and Tatum, with Brown playing the two with his 7-foot wingspan, and the rookie Tatum, the third pick overall in last June\u2019s Draft , stepping in for Hayward at small forward. They are, nightly, violating one of the NBA\u2019s sacred screeds \u2014 young players can\u2019t defend without fouling. Even Irving \u2014 thought an indifferent at best defender while he was with the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 is putting effort into it. Teams are only shooting 33 percent on 3-pointers against Boston, third-best in the NBA . \u201cJust our length,\u201d Irving said Saturday, \u201cbeing able to communicate on the fly, having a system that\u2019s predicated on shrinking the floor, just being very active. Obviously we\u2019re going to foul, but the times when you don\u2019t foul, we limit teams to some tough shots, some tough twos and some tough contested threes, I think we put ourselves in great position. And when you have guards rebounding, as well as bigs down there boxing out and staying active, it makes all of our jobs a lot easier. \u201cWe\u2019re all five just connected out there, and that\u2019s from the first unit to the second unit to anybody that\u2019s out on the floor. We understand the importance of valuing every possession.\u201d Brown and Tatum are doing it every night, turning defense into offense, with Horford\u2019s talking at the back of the defense critical to getting everyone into place. \u201cI just try to go out there and execute the game plan we have, and the mindset we have on defense,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cTry to be as physical as possible without fouling, because when you foul you\u2019ve got to come out of the game. And I like to play.\u201d With so many new players, the Celtics made defense a priority during training camp. You can see it on the court \u2014 the high hands, measured closeouts and making opponents shoot over length. Tatum guarded Kevin Durant last Thursday and was more than credible. \u201cPreseason workouts, that was a big emphasis,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cGuard without reaching. Guard your yard without fouling. We focused on that a lot \u2026 the veterans on the team helped me out a lot in preseason and training camp. Coach can talk all the time, but when you get that advice from the older players, it can be more valuable.\u201d Brown has made the transition to playing two guards about as seamlessly as possible. He got bigger, of course, as young players who are diligent in the weight room do. But it hasn\u2019t seemed to impact his quickness. If he can stay in front of his man, his arms can do the rest. And he still texts former Celtics guard Avery Bradley (now in Detroit) \u2014 the guy who\u2019s position he\u2019s playing \u2014 for pointers on occasion. \u201cThey utilize their length appropriately,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey\u2019re both long for their positions; I think that helps. So you\u2019re not playing Jaylen at the three as much and Jayson at the four as much; you\u2019re playing them at the two and the three. They can use that length \u2026 we saw that the other night; all of a sudden, Jaylen\u2019s guarding a three man that\u2019s seven feet tall, and it\u2019s a little different. But the biggest thing is they work hard on technique and they work hard on film study every day. And they need to continue that.\u201d But Brown and Tatum are also being productive on offense, and not leaving it all on Irving\u2019s shoulders to score. Brown is averaging 15.8 points per game, while making 39.5 percent of his 3-pointers. Tatum averages 13.9 ppg, shooting 49.4 percent overall and 47.9 percent on 3-pointers. ( These were not 3-pointers , but they\u2019re cool to watch.) Boston\u2019s next four opponents \u2014 Dallas tonight ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), Miami on Wednesday ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), Orlando on Friday ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) and Indiana on Saturday ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) \u2014 are all eminently beatable. If the Celtics get through that quartet, they\u2019d be riding an 18-game streak with a five-game homestand looming at the start of December. Their offense may not be fixed by then. But that hasn\u2019t mattered for a month. Defense travels, and fits nicely in your locker at home, too. \u201cBrad\u2019s made that very clear,\u201d Irving said, \u201cif the (defensive) effort\u2019s not out there, if you\u2019re not paying attention, if you\u2019re not preparing the way we all should be preparing \u2014 that goes from the head coach down to the 15th guy \u2014 if you\u2019re not preparing the way you should and perfecting your craft outside of the game, being very diligent, understanding our system, why it works, why we\u2019re doing it, why the hell would you expect to play? He made it very simple.

He was a cheerleader. He was a mascot. He played basketball. And he was a media member. And I feel like that\u2019s everything. I want everyone to feel like they\u2019re a part of it, not just the players, but the whole experience.\u201d The elder Sager children sat side by side Saturday at Dacula, in a room reserved for referees and staff, as 32 high school teams began play at the inaugural Craig Sager Memorial Basketball Tournament, a four-day event held about a half hour south of Atlanta and featuring some of the best teams in Gwinnett County and the greater Atlanta area. With the help of Dacula\u2019s basketball coach, Dr. Russ Triaga, a 10-month slog to bring all the logistics of organizing and funding such an ambitious event was finally coming to an end. But honoring their dad, my Turner Sports colleague who died last December from multiple myeloma after a courageous three-year battle , was just beginning. In putting on this tournament, they hope to remind people of the person their dad was. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome to do something, and to talk about our dad, and to not have to talk about cancer for the first time since he got sick,\u201d Kacy Sager said. \u201cI\u2019d rather you tell me you got drunk with him after a game or something.\u201d All but two of the teams were local; one team came from Binghamton, N.Y. (\u201cthe coach was my college roommate,\u201d Triaga said). Every team was guaranteed playing three games during the four-day tournament, which waived the standard entry fee most tournaments ask of participating teams. But this is a non-exempt tournament, not an exhibition \u2014 the games count on each team\u2019s record. The four brackets, named in honor of Craig, Sr.\u2019s infamous wardrobe choices \u2014 Plaid, Paisley, Floral and Chevron ( this is but one example of a Chevron fabric pattern ) \u2014 will have champions crowned on Tuesday. * Aldridge:  Craig Sager\u2019s life, career remembered by those who knew him best Gwinnett County embodied the sense of competition Craig, Jr., wanted the tournament to display. \u201cGwinnett County in particular, with all their sports, they have, without question, the best community support,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have some of the biggest schools in the state. They\u2019re good in football; they\u2019re good in basketball; they\u2019re great in women\u2019s sports, especially.\u201d  Triaga met Sager Sr. when they both worked at Turner Sports. They were on an elevator together. \u201cAnd he looks at me and he goes \u2018dude, your shoe\u2019s untied.\u2019 And I looked down and kind of pretended I didn\u2019t hear him. And he said \u2018no, really \u2014 your shoe\u2019s untied.\u2019 And I looked down and my shoe was untied. And I went down and tied it, and just as I did the elevator doors opened up and he said \u2018anything I can do to help make your day a little better,\u2019 and he just went on about his business.\u201d More than two decades later, after Senior\u2019s death, Triaga, the head coach at Dacula the last six years, was in his office. \u201cIt was the middle of January,\u201d Triaga said. \u201cWe were just like in the Dog Days of January, just kind of playing games. I was talking to Byron (Wilson, his assistant coach), and he was like, you look tired. I was like, \u2018Byron, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this. I\u2019ve got a really talented team. I\u2019ve got a lot of talented players coming back next year. But I can kind of see the end coming. I\u2019m like, I just want to do something different. I want to do something that no one else does. And I don\u2019t want to do a showcase (generally, showcase events usually are single-day events featuring high-profile teams from different conferences or leagues playing against one another). I want everybody involved.\u2019 And he said, \u2018well, who is somebody that would want everybody involved?\u2019 \u201d Scanning his phone, he came across Craig Sager, Jr.\u2019s number. Junior has been a fixture on the Georgia scholastic sports scene for years as a journalist. After walking on three years for the University of Georgia football team, he started covering sports across the region working for Score Atlanta, a sports marketing firm. He also writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s high school section. Triaga didn\u2019t want to push; Sager, Sr., had only passed a month earlier. So he left Junior a message, not expecting to hear anything for a while. He got a call back from Junior in 10 minutes \u2014 \u201cthe fastest anyone\u2019s ever gotten a response from my brother,\u201d Kacy Sager says.  Junior did not pick up organizational skills from his father \u2014 \u201che would have been even worse than I am at organizing a tournament; he wouldn\u2019t have a clue what to do,\u201d he said. But he and Kacy \u2014 named such by their mother, Lisa, because Lisa was pregnant with her in 1985 when Kansas City was in the World Series, and because Lisa and Craig, Sr., met at a Royals game \u2014 persevered. \u201cThe last three years alone were the most exhausting three years of my life,\u201d Craig, Jr. said. \u201cI was ready to do it. But also, I had a lot going on. I had the big visions for it. Russ obviously laid all of the groundwork, had the teams and made sure every decision was okay, and made it easy for me. I was just trying to figure out, everything about my dad\u2019s legacy, it was all about his battle with cancer. And I felt like this was a way to bring it back.\u201d His schedule was filled, though \u2014 the opening season for Atlanta\u2019s Major League Soccer franchise, Atlanta United FC, began in September \u2014 the same month that Mercedes-Benz Stadium (the new home of the Atlanta Falcons and United FC) opened for business. And Score Atlanta was helping to put on the Corky Kell Classic , a three-day, nine-team event that serves as the unofficial kickoff to the high school football season in the area. Junior wanted a basketball tournament that did the same. Getting the teams lined up and the tournament format figured out was relatively simple. Getting people to actually commit funds to help was a different animal. It was especially frustrating because Junior knew and had worked with numerous sponsors for football events in the past. But there were few people willing to step up financially. In the end, the Sagers saved money by holding off televising the first two days of the tournament locally; the Finals for each of the four brackets will be shown locally on SUVtv, an online broadcast network that does basketball games in Atlanta and the Southeast. The financial spine of the tournament was almost all grass roots \u2014 a GoFundMe set up by Kacy, which she pushed hard on Twitter and other social media outlets. There wasn\u2019t a rainmaker, no NBA player sending in a big check to seed the whole thing. \u201cWe got a little boxed in,\u201d Kacy Sager said. \u201cThe way we were trying to sell the advertising space, it was just a very, I think, standard way of approaching funding something like this. We just needed to just go outside of that. As soon as we were like \u2018hey, it\u2019s the Craig Sager Touranment,\u2019 just trying to convince people it was going to be a high school event that was worth getting behind, as opposed to treating it like something different, once we stopped focusing on that so much, things started falling into place a little faster.\u201d Said Craig, Jr.: \u201cit\u2019d be nice to have a Foot Locker sponsor come in and give every single person a special floral jersey or something like that. But I think the fact that it\u2019s the community, it\u2019s people on Twitter that were just a fan of our dad or a fan of high school basketball. And that\u2019s all there is. There\u2019s nothing else. There\u2019s no Sager Strong.\u201d On Saturday, everything wasn\u2019t in place. The Shiloh team\u2019s bus to the school broke down on a highway; another bus wasn\u2019t dropping its team off where it was supposed to drop them. More t-shirts for Monday were on the way. In other words, the tournament was going along just as all tournaments do \u2014 a hundred little fires popping up, every hour on the hour, that are summarily put out, leaving the hosts a minute\u2019s rest before the next conflagration. But the stress levels were relatively low on the court, even though the games would count in each team\u2019s standings. The refs worked in day-glo yellow shirts, the same color as Craig Jr.\u2019s custom-made hoodie. Both he and Kacy wondered if they should dress crazily formal in honor of their dad, and decided comfort made more sense And they\u2019re already planning next year\u2019s tournament. Junior wants to get every player a swag bag next year, with gear from the Falcons, Braves, Hawks and United. Kacy, who was named that by her mother is hopeful that she can get Ice Cube\u2019s Big3 League to play an exhibition on the first day of next year\u2019s tournament. The University of Georgia donated tickets for its basketball game Sunday against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. In pulling this off, bringing a big event to life to honor their larger than life but nonetheless goofy dad, they felt somewhat at home. \u201cI know, for me, going into sports, and my sister, covering sports \u2026 it\u2019s a family thing,\u201d Craig, Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s who we are. I wouldn\u2019t know it any other way.\u201d The Craig Sager Memorial Basketball Tournament continues today at Dacula High School in Dacula, Ga., and continues through the championship round Tuesday.

From Tom Hogan: I thought LeBron James\u2019 comments about the Knicks picking the wrong point guard were meant for Phil Jackson. He tried to intimidate the kid on the court. Has he told Magic that he picked the wrong point guard? Enes Kanter stood up for the young man. Frank Ntilikina has carried himself well and is steadily improving. The Garden was on fire and only the greatness of the King and white lightning Korver had the right stuff to put out the flame. Of course LeBron was trolling Phil, not Frank Ntilikina. That was rather obvious. That goes back to Jackson referring to James\u2019 friends and business partners as his \u201cposse\u201d last year. Ntilikina has played very well for the Knicks so far and the hope is he can come from out of the shadow Jackson cast on him by taking him in the Draft as a potential triangle guard. The kid has talent in any system. The Process, Vol. MCMLXXXVIII. From Mike Pettiford: I\u2019m a Blazers fan currently living in the Philadelphia-area, and I\u2019ve debated many Sixers fans about \u201cthe Process.\u201d The gains are starting to pay off with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons (and, potentially, Markelle Fultz), but the franchise willfully sacrificed no fewer than four years of incredible futility to get to where they are now. Now that we\u2019re able to at least say that Philly is a playoff contender (and possibly more in the near-term), what is the talk around the league about rebuilding a non-marquee franchise, now that you can see the benefits of tanking for multiple years? Is it to endure another #trusttheprocess and seek multiple superstars at the risk of alienating your fanbase? Or is it the Thunder model, where you hope to player develop and strike it rich with an All-Star or two? That is the chicken\/egg question today, Mike. You\u2019re right on the money. This is the dilemma I\u2019ve had in assessing how the Sixers built their team. Many (not all, certainly) of their social media-centric fans seem to have developed amnesia about the preceding three years, when the building was half-empty and the team had all but ceased to exist in the collective consciousness among much of the Philly fan base. It worked out in the end, and that\u2019s all that matters if you\u2019re a fan. But other teams, like Phoenix, have tried the same route and not had the same success \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 even though the Suns have some young talent. OKC went Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook-Serge Ibaka-James Harden with four straight first-round picks from 2007-09, but along with that, the Thunder was the only major game in town and played in a very different market from Philadelphia. Sometimes, a banana is not a banana. From Derron Jackson: The way it\u2019s looking now, Ben Simmons will run away with the Rookie of the Year award. However, given that he had a year of NBA coaching, training and salary, (should) we consider him a \u201crookie?\u201d The exposure of NBA life even without playing any games has to give you a leg up right? Good question, Derron. I do understand your sentiment. I would just say in response that players for a generation have all said the same thing, that nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 prepares you for NBA basketball except playing NBA basketball. Being around it, doing all the lifting and running, getting coaching on the plane or bus are all good, but you only learn and improve by being on the floor against the best players in the world, night in and night out. So I\u2019m not going to subtract in any way from what he\u2019s doing (I agree with you that right now, he\u2019s the odds-on favorite for ROTY) because he was around last season.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (38.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 8.3 apg, .433 FG, 1.000 FT): Made 48 straight free throws dating back to the third quarter of the Rockets\u2019 win over Memphis Nov. 11. That includes 19 of 19 and 18 of 18 from the line in consecutive games with Toronto and Phoenix. 2) LeBron James (31 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 8.7 rpg, .563 FG, .611 FT): Yes, he\u2019s seemingly indestructible. And I\u2019ll likely be proven wrong (again) in June when he\u2019s led Cleveland to another Finals. But he\u2019s logging killer minutes. And fatigued players tend to get injured.

The veteran Heat big man took off the warmups for the first time this year in the waning minutes of Sunday\u2019s blowout loss to the Pacers. 1) The NBA and the NBPA under Adam Silver and Michele Roberts have achieved a genuine working relationship with one another. The last CBA negotiation was certainly smoothed by the $24 billion in national television money, but either side still could have been greedy and held out for bigger cuts of that pie. Neither did. So I don\u2019t see any reason they can\u2019t figure out a better plan for Draft eligibility than one-and-done . Major League Baseball\u2019s system, allowing high schoolers to declare for the Draft, while compelling those who do decide to attend college to be there at least three years before being eligible for the Draft \u2014 still seems to me to be the best compromise. If the next LeBron or Kobe is deemed ready both by themselves and NBA types to play in the league at 18, let \u2018em in. But if there is any doubt, let them go to school and at least get close to earning their degrees by taking classes for three years before coming out. David Stern thought it was a bad look having NBA scouts in high school gyms, and I understood his point. But times have changed. The league and union should quickly come together and change with them. It would help just about everyone involved, starting with the players, while only hurting those who are\/were delusional enough to ignore warnings that they weren\u2019t close to being ready to play pro ball, yet declare for the Draft out of high school anyway. 2) Great, great reporting from Bleacher Report\u2019s Ric Bucher on Kevin Durant . 3) Agree with Mr. Angelo . It may be hard for some of you to believe or understand, but everybody doesn\u2019t want to go viral. Everybody doesn\u2019t want to be on TMZ. Everyone doesn\u2019t want to be famous. 4) Sad that David Lee is formally retiring after 12 NBA seasons. He was a force on the glass for many years before injuries and age took their toll. But I\u2019m not that sad. He\u2019s going to spend the rest of his life with Caroline Wozniacki. 1) Good to hear Markelle Fultz\u2019s shoulder is starting to respond to treatment . But it\u2019s going to be a while before the first overall pick is back on the floor and playing to his potential, and I think the Sixers are going to need him at some point this season. 2) They\u2019re very lucky . And, they\u2019re also very stupid. How immature and unaware do you have to be to think that the risk of shoplifting in China is worth taking? 3) I have lost the will to L-I-V-E. 4) I answered a question in the Tip last week about what to do about the spate of mass killings. The writer of the e-mail had several points, some of which I agreed with, and some that I did not. The biggest point of disagreement I had was when the writer opined that \u201chistorians\u201d had verified that \u201cpower and greed, not race or ethnicity, are at the heart of inequality and social injustice.\u201d I submit again that neither power nor greed has anything to do with this being the reality of the current criminal justice system . Even if you argue that \u201cgreed\u201d in the form of the private, for-profit prison system that is rampant in this country drives this particular outcome \u2014 prisons need prisoners in order to stay open and make money \u2014 you still have to do deal with the more pertinent fact that judges feel empowered to sentence men of color to harsher sentences, knowing that there will be almost no backlash or condemnation from the majority community. That is walking, talking, generation-destroying privilege at work. 5) This is not a good idea . * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Celtics\u2019 defense gets sharper | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | New tribute to Sager\u2019s life | Your questions on Sixers & more | Q&A Idan Ravin * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

A generation of NBA players has sought out Idan Ravin for his \u2014 it\u2019s almost descended into clich\u00e9 now \u2014 unconventional training methods, and been challenged and changed by them. And he has remained one of the top personal trainers working with NBA players, along with the likes of Rob McClanaghan, Joe Abunassar, Drew Hanlen and others. Ravin first worked with Steve Francis, who, like him, attended the University of Maryland. That led to gigs with a Who\u2019s Who of NBA stars over the years \u2014 LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul \u2014 all of whom got better at basketball by spending their summer months with Ravin, the former lawyer who topped out as a player in high school and whose coaching experience was limited to youth basketball. This past summer, Ravin got back together with Detroit center Andre Drummond, whom he trained before the Pistons took Drummond ninth overall in the 2012 Draft, and who had bottomed out as a player in 2016-17. While he was thought by many as the premier rebounder in the league, Drummond had little impact, and many believed it was because he didn\u2019t want to get fouled late in games, when his deficiency as a free throw shooter would cost Detroit. He shot 38 percent from the line last season \u2014 the fourth year in five as a pro that Drummond couldn\u2019t crack 40 percent on foul shots. But this season, Drummond isn\u2019t only shooting a career-high 63 percent from the line (a drop from the 75-percent clip with which he began the season), he\u2019s been given the chance to be a playmaker and passer. And Ravin also worked with Orlando\u2019s Aaron Gordon, the high-flying forward who looked miscast as a small forward last season with the Magic, in large part because he couldn\u2019t shoot 3-pomters \u2014 28.8 percent last season. But after a summer with \u201cThe Hoops Whisperer,\u201d as Ravin is known in some circles, Gordon has completely remade his game. He\u2019s shooting 47 percent behind the arc, and has become a dynamic scorer for Orlando, including a career-best 41-point night in October a gainst Brooklyn . Ravin is trying to reach the next generation of NBA players where they live, on social media (@IdanWan, idanwan on Instagram, etc.), while bringing his unique training aesthetic to the party \u2014 holistic, but demanding. Not a miracle, but effective. Me: How different is the relationship today between teams and personal trainers\/coaches than it was when you started? Is it more collaborative? Idan Ravin: I would hope, but I don\u2019t find it that way at all. In many, many ways it hasn\u2019t changed at all. I don\u2019t seek permission from someone when I work with an athlete. It\u2019s something we discuss. And I\u2019m supremely confident in my work and how I can help, and I do the work, and then I send them back to their team or I touch base with them at another point. There is always going to be tension. I understand. That\u2019s their asset and they have a lot of money invested and they feel they want to have their people do the work. But when I feel like the athlete\u2019s my responsibility as well, then I act responsibly to them. And when I know I can fix and help and make change and refine and improve, it\u2019s my responsibility to do that work. Me: Would you ever cold call a player if you really thought you could help them?  IR: No, because I don\u2019t like the solicitation element. To me, it has to be something that really grows organically. Are there certain guys around the league that really intrigue me? Yeah. Sure. But it would have to be a situation where we just meet in a really normal, relaxed way where we can have a really honest conversation. Because I don\u2019t have a business card. I don\u2019t work in conjunction with other people. It has to be an organic relationship that grows. Me: Do you ever have differences of opinion with a player \u2014 where a player may say \u2018I want to work on this,\u2019 and you say, \u2018you don\u2019t need to work on that\u2019? IR: I don\u2019t believe in the concept of buy in, the way the sports institution does. I just think it\u2019s a very antiquated way of dealing with people. I collaborate with my athletes. There\u2019s things that they see and things that I see, and it becomes a bit of consensus. What they see might not always be accurate. I just try to create some clarity as well. There\u2019s a lot of stuff where, while they may play the game, there\u2019s a lot of stuff they don\u2019t necessarily know the why behind a lot of it. I always spend time with them, but I can\u2019t spend time explaining that. I do still hope that eventually they turn back and go \u2018wow, Idan, now that all makes sense.\u2019 It is unconventional and it is different. I don\u2019t regurgitate philosophy. In every situation, I try to find a creative solution for it. With Andre\u2019s situation with people making comments about his free throw shooting, this never started, never once was our focus on making him a better free throw shooter. Never. That wasn\u2019t even the subject of the conversation. Our conversation was we have to become better: become a better player, become a better person, become better focused, all that. And the free throws were a byproduct of all the better. Me: Was your approach any different with Drummond because his free throw issues were so public and obvious to people \u2014 whereas other guys may be working on improvements that are more subtle? IR: There were so many more things. That wasn\u2019t something we even had a conversation about. It was, \u2018you\u2019re going to lose 30 pounds. We\u2019re going to get better. We\u2019re going to become more serious. We\u2019re going to get more focused.\u2019 And I\u2019ve said this before: what I saw him do this summer, and what he did with me, he\u2019s at 15 percent capacity what he\u2019s doing with his team. He could be absolutely extraordinary. Extraordinary. But it\u2019s hard to believe that when you see 6-11 and 285 pounds. You see that in a certain way. But what I saw this summer\u2026magical. Me: So what makes you think he hasn\u2019t scratched the surface? IR: Because he\u2019s so much more skilled than people know. But he\u2019s developed that. In the time with me, under my watch, I saw that. He\u2019s really smart. But people don\u2019t know that and don\u2019t want to understand that. He\u2019s uber creative, which are all signs to me of brilliant people. He can be very meticulous. All of those things are elements of people who can be really special. There\u2019s lots of talented people in the NBA, of course. But not all of those people have all of those other skills, too. He has those. Me: How do you keep it fresh, just for you, in your own head? IR: Every player\u2019s different to me. I love, I\u2019ve worked with the elite veteran ground. But I\u2019ve also made it a point to identify the younger generation, and this summer it was Aaron and Dre. I love, often times, taking that athlete that people have sort of counted them out: Aaron, he just can dunk. Or Andre Drummond, he\u2019s just an underachiever. Part of my thing is to say, you know what? I\u2019m going to make this happen. We\u2019re going to make this happen.  Me: Okay, Aaron Gordon. Where did you start with him? Was the mental side more important than the physical, because he\u2019s such a great athlete? IR: The point was we tried to minimize being an athlete. That was a lot of this. It\u2019s like, I know you\u2019re a pretty girl. I get it. But what else is there? You\u2019re a great writer; you can have Shakespeare in your brain. But if you don\u2019t know how to operate a computer, you don\u2019t know how to turn it on, you don\u2019t know word processing, or you don\u2019t know how to type, Shakespeare never appears. So there has to be a physical element as well, and then the mental element kicks in as well. And they work symbiotically. This idea that I\u2019m just going to have great thoughts, and then I\u2019m going to become a great player? To me, that\u2019s just empty promises. The physical is a big part of all of this. Me: With Aaron, what did you see that needed fixing? Or, improving? IR: I think it was just this complete overhaul. There was a technical side, there was a physical side, there was a mental side. And there was also him getting healthy, too, because for a lot of parts of his career he wasn\u2019t playing at 100 percent. There was also convincing him, you\u2019re more than the best dunker in the world. There\u2019s a lot to you. And with him, I fundamentally believe he can be a top five player in the NBA, and be first team all-defense, and do things that no one has done on both sides of the ball. Because he\u2019s only 22, and he\u2019s incredibly bright, and incredibly thoughtful, incredibly diligent, incredibly resilient. And he cares. I can\u2019t tell you how many Friday nights in the summer time we were in the gym at 10 o\u2019clock at night. On a Friday night in the summertime. He doesn\u2019t have to do that. But he wanted to do that. Hard work, to me, is overstated. Lots and lots of people work hard. It was just more how you work, which is more important to me. Me: You\u2019ve spoken about different inspirations that have aided you in your work. Has that changed as you\u2019ve gotten older? IR: For sure. I feel like when I started this a long time ago, I was a one-star chef. And I taught myself to cook, and I got a little better, and then I became a one and a half star chef. And I hope, God willing, that now I\u2019m a five-star chef. There\u2019s always a responsibility to evolve and become more sophisticated, and find inspiration from many sources. And so I take teachings that other people don\u2019t see. And I think that\u2019s been part of my own internal growth. I had to do this on my own. I don\u2019t have a mentor. I don\u2019t have a library I go to. I don\u2019t have people teaching me what to do. This is all on my shoulders. I\u2019ve had to constantly grow and refine and evolve. Often times, I test my work based on the production of the athlete. So whether it\u2019s taking an athlete who\u2019s not to get supposed to be drafted but finding him in the first round? Or taking a kid who\u2019s got the worst 3-point shooting in the NBA, and now at one point he was at 70 percent? Those are reflections of my own growth and my own development. Me: So, with a guy like Andre, how do you factor in regression to the mean? I mean, he started off shooting 75 percent from the line; there\u2019s going to be natural regression, right? IR: During the season, yes \u2026 the thing that\u2019s sometimes difficult as well \u2014 without taking a jab at the team, but under my watch there\u2019s a certain level of expectation and promise. On other people\u2019s watches, I don\u2019t know what happens. So that regression, I have to take a step back and go, well, why? Me: So there could be an actual explanation for something like regression? IR: Yeah, for sure. There\u2019s certain things that I\u2019m looking for and certain things that I emphasize that\u2019s part of our tactic, that I can kind of address and fix. When they\u2019re not under your watch, different things could happen, obviously. They could do better, they could do worse, they could stay the same. I have incredible high expectations for the athletes I work with. All of them. Those Hall of Famers, like Steph or Melo, I expect grandeur from them. With the younger guys, I know what I\u2019ve seen from Drummond, I know what I\u2019ve seen from Aaron. Like, when people say he\u2019s doing well, I\u2019m thinking, hmmm, he\u2019s doing okay. But what I expect of him? When I saw (Gordon) score 41 points in that game, honestly, he could have had 60. He passed up seven or eight shots he should have taken. Me: How does your approach change with a Josh Hart, who was a little older than some of the guys when you start working with them? IR: Josh was a very unique situation. After his junior year they won the national championship, and he put his name in the Draft and they said you should go back to school. Not telling him, man, you could very possibly get drafted. Senior year was pretty much the same and he wasn\u2019t super high on a lot of draft boards. But spending time with him and getting to know him, and knowing he really cares and he comes from a great family and there\u2019s some really good people around him, I was like, I\u2019m up for this challenge. And then when he went in the first round, it was like, we did it. Then what happened over Summer League, and him getting hurt during the season, those are all kinds of extraneous variables it\u2019s hard to control, that you wish he didn\u2019t have to suffer and deal with all that. But that\u2019s also the life of a professional athlete, which is something that\u2019s always foreseeable. Me: But his game was sort of already fully formed. And I don\u2019t mean that as a criticism; I mean he was already a pretty solid player. IR: I guess it all depends on how we define fully formed. He played a certain way because it was beneficial for his team to play a certain way. To me, there were technical things that could be fixed, whether it was how he shot the ball, or how he ran or how he moved, or how he saw himself. There were certain things that may seem small to other people, but they were mountains to me. Me: Conversely, how do you continue challenge guys that have been in the league a long time and have a certain way they like to do things, or have reached a level of familiarity and comfort? IR: They have to meet me halfway. I will always find ways to challenge you. I will always find ways to make it hard but improve your performance. But at the same time, it still has to matter to you. I have a lot of admiration and respect for people who\u2019ve made it and continue to find and are ambitious and are intrinsically motivated. For all the crap people say about Mark Cuban, there are values that make him get up early in the morning, and he\u2019s still very, very devoted to what he does. I would say the same for Paul Allen, Bill Gates, Steve Wynn, all those guys. Even (the late Wizards owner) Abe Pollin. They made it, to the thousandth degree. And yet they were intrinsically motivated people that always found a way \u2014 I want to challenge myself and become informed and become curious and better, whatever it is. So, those older players, it\u2019s the same idea. I\u2019ll meet you halfway if it matters to you that much. Me: Ever want to go back to the law? IR: No. No. Never. It was a great lesson in teaching myself how to think a different way and how to socialize a work ethic. Lots of people in the institution of sports will always dismiss the fact that, oh, what does a former lawyer know about this? I\u2019m thinking, unless you have that law degree, unless you\u2019ve practiced, unless you\u2019ve been through it, you have no idea what its value could be to you. It was part of my past that I recognize, but it\u2019s definitely, definitely not for me. \u2014 NFL Network reporter Stacey Dales ( @StaceyDales ), Wednesday, 11:30 p.m., eviscerating a troll who brought out the usual \u201cstick to the NFL\u201d tripe after Dales \u2014 who was also the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002, and who is still Oklahoma\u2019s all-time leader in assists (764) \u2014 tweeted that Lonzo Ball was \u201cthe most over-hyped player I have ever seen.

(We\u2019re talking about Seattle, not Rochester or Fort Wayne.) Of the 21 other players who participated in Wilkins\u2019 first NBA game on Nov. 3, 2004, 19 of them are retired or otherwise inactive . Shaun Livingston and Nick Collison also made their pro debuts that night, the former as a 19-year-old freshman out of Peoria Central, the latter as a 2003 first-round pick who lost his initial season to shoulder injuries. Wilkins? He had gone undrafted out of Georgia in 2004, only landing a contract after a strong Summer League showing. He was two months shy of his 25th birthday when he scored three points with four rebounds in 10 minutes off the Sonics\u2019 bench that night in L.A. John Kerry\u2019s Presidential bid had ended 48 hours earlier. Jamie Foxx\u2019s \u201cRay\u201d and the horror flick \u201cSaw\u201d would dominate theater box offices that weekend. And Wilkins\u2019 role then in his highly competitive business was the same as it is now as the old guy off the Indiana Pacers\u2019 bench. \u201cIt\u2019s easier now, just knowing I\u2019ve got to be ready,\u201d Wilkins said after a recent game in Chicago. \u201cFor the most part, that\u2019s been my whole career: I\u2019ve always had to be ready. Had to work as hard as I could to make a team my rookie year, and that story has been the same throughout my career.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it if I could.\u201d That is a little hard to believe, given this man\u2019s heritage and underpinnings in the NBA. He is the son, after all, of Gerald Wilkins, 54, who played 13 seasons and 900 games mostly for the Knicks, Cavaliers and Magic in the 1980s and \u201890s. And he is the nephew of Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins, a nine-time All-Star who ranks 13th in NBA\/ABA scoring average (24.8) and 15th all-time in points. Both older Wilkins played their final NBA games as teammates in Orlando in 1999, Gerald at age 35, Dominique at age 39. So longevity has been on Damien\u2019s side. So, at new-millennium pay rates, have earnings \u2013 Damien will top an estimated $20 million if he sticks all season, right between his pop\u2019s $15.8 million and Uncle \u2018Nique\u2019s $22.6 million. But Damien\u2019s trek through the league has been more humble and more trying. His elders were known as scorers; he never has averaged double figures or started more than 31 games in a season. And while they had detours in their careers \u2013 Gerald missed the 1994-95 season with injuries, Dominique spent a season each in Greece and Italy near the end \u2013 neither had to navigate anything approaching the four-year hiatus from which Damien only recently returned. After the offer-sheet deal Wilkins signed with Minnesota (and matched by the Sonics\/Thunder) as a restricted free agent in 2005 ended in 2010, he bounced through three teams \u2013 Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia \u2013 in as many seasons on veterans\u2019 minimum deals. He played his last game with the Sixers in April 2013. By December of that year, he was a member of the Beijing Ducks. Five months later, he wrapped up that basketball season playing for the Indios de Mayaguez team in Puerto Rico. Wilkins spent the 2014-15 regular season with the Iowa Energy of the NBA development league before again joining the Indios for their playoffs. That summer, he was the old head on a U.S. team that earned a bronze medal at the Pan American Games in Toronto (\u201cThe color of it says third-place, but for me this is my gold medal,\u201d he said soon afterward ). Then it was on to Venezuela to play for the Guaros de Lara, followed by another season in the now-G League with Greensboro, followed by a playoff tour back in Puerto Rico with the Brujos de Guayama. All of which got Wilkins back to the NBA with Indiana, where his latest coach, Nate McMillan, happens also to have been his first coach so long ago in Seattle. With a young team, a roster spot in flux due to Glenn Robinson III\u2019s left ankle surgery and a locker room in need of some wisdom, McMillan and Pacers GM Kevin Pritchard looked to Wilkins. Better to have a veteran who can share some advice while knowing how to stay in shape on the side, they figured, than yet another young player who might not develop or stay sharp without reliable minutes in games. Wilkins has appeared in nine games, averaging just 6.6 minutes, while scoring 10 points on 12 shots. Now when he enters an arena or shows up courtside, rival players or other employees occasionally shoot him a \u201cwhere have you been?\u201d look, consider the time that passed while Wilkins worked the basketball back waters. \u201cGuys are mostly just happy in following my story and following my career and the path I\u2019ve had to take,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cSo many guys might have just given up if they had been in my shoes. But I saw value \u2013 I thought I could help a team \u2013 so I stayed at it. I\u2019m fortunate to be here now and I\u2019m taking full advantage of it.\u201d Wilkins will turn 38 on Jan. 11, which makes him the fifth oldest player in the NBA behind Vince Carter, Manu Ginobili, Jason Terry (all already 40) and Dirk Nowitzki, who will turn 40 in June. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily qualify as a trend, there has been a graying of the league around the temples, with 16 active players who are or by Feb. 1 will turn 36. Five years ago, there were 17 such players. Ten years ago, 15 of them. But 25 years ago, only seven players were or were on the verge of age 36 and there were no active 40-year-olds. When we saw them at all, they were generally proven centers like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Robert Parish or Kevin Willis who basically ran in straight lines from rim to rim to conserve energy. Training techniques, medical care and mega-salaries all enable or incentivize players to stick around longer. And for a role player like Wilkins, there may be another factor. \u201cMostly I think it\u2019s guys being good guys,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cNowadays a lot of these teams have \u2018veterans\u2019 who are 23 years old. Our veterans were 33, 34, 35. Guys who\u2019ve been around a while can have a positive influence on a locker room and get guys\u2019 attention, y\u2019know, that sometimes coaches can\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s invaluable. I\u2019m grateful the Pacers have given me the opportunity to be that voice.\u201d Wilkins is impressed by Victor Oladipo\u2019s play so far for Indiana, excited to watch Domantas Sabonis\u2019 continued development and eager to share what he can with young big Myles Turner and the rest. Asked about the changes he has noticed on and off the court, Wilkins said: \u201cOn the court, I would say that the league has gotten smaller. It\u2019s gotten faster and gone smaller, a lot of position-less basketball. Bigs are now \u2018twos\u2019 and \u2018threes.\u2019 \u201cOff the court, it\u2019s hard to tell. I still do the same things off the court that I did the last time I was here. Go to practice. Go home. Go back to the gym at night. Go home. On the road, I might be in my hotel room with my movies.\u201d Back in 2004, \u201csocial media\u201d was email and the telephone. And now \u2026 \u201cSocial media is crazy now. Every move is clocked,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real private life anymore. Most guys when I was first coming in, they wanted to keep their business to themselves. It\u2019s just a sign, time\u2019s changing.\u201d Wilkins, like so many, values more now the life he\u2019s had in basketball than he did as a younger man. Growing up in the game, it\u2019s understandable that he might have just assumed some aspects of it. That isn\u2019t the case now, as he savors the games, practices and trips he has left. \u201cI don\u2019t take it for granted at all, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a deep appreciation for it. I have a deep appreciation just for ice bags being made. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you get away from it, you don\u2019t realize how good you had it when you were here. I try to tell all these young guys, \u2018Don\u2019t take this for granted. Things could be a lot worse.\u2019 \u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Real strong. It\u2019s true, if you have hopes of ascending to the top of the mountain this season, you\u2019d better turn in some memorable performances, triple-doubles, 40-point efforts and then some. That\u2019s what happens when the club opens its doors to \u201cyoungsters.\u201d Even if you do all that, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be sitting at the head of the table, not when a certain four-time MVP goes off for 57. Good luck, folks. Notes: Season statistics are through games of Nov. 16 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 31.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 8.6 apg Season stats: 28.3 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 8.7 apg Anytime you open the two-week period with a 57-point performance, you ain\u2019t going anywhere. Period. Mr. James could\u2019ve put up bagels the rest of the way and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. (We say that knowing it never would\u2019ve happened). And here\u2019s the real scary part: LeBron is eclipsing career highs in FG% (57.9), FT% (81.4), assists (8.7) and blocks (1.3). Like a fine wine, right? 2. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 19.7 ppg, 8.8 rpg, 4.3 apg Season stats: 20.1 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 3.4 apg It was looking like a ho-hum stretch for Gasol \u2026 until he exploded for 35 and 13 on Wednesday. Like James, Gasol is setting career highs in several categories: 9.3 rebounds (would tie his mark set in 2009-10), 1.9 blocks (would tie his mark in \u201911-12) and 1.6 3-pointers made per game. He\u2019s also just four double-doubles away from matching all of last season\u2019s total.  3. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 20.1 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 22.0 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 2.4 apg Despite slipping one spot, Aldridge had a relatively productive period, including a 32-point showing Wednesday. But the big thing for Aldridge is rest. In three games with no rest, he averaged 14.3 points and 43.2 FG%. In two games with one day of rest, he totaled 23 points and 59.4 FG%. And in two games with two days of rest, Aldridge went for 26 points and 57.1 FG%. 4. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 16.8 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 1.3 apg Season stats: 20.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 1.5 apg Unlike James and Gasol, Anthony is going the other direction in a couple of categories. After shooting just 34.9 from the field over the last two weeks, Anthony is sitting at a career-low 41.8 for the season. His previous low was 42.6 in \u201903-04, his rookie season. Anthony is also averaging just 1.5 assists, which would be the lowest of his career by a wide margin (2.6 in \u201904-05 and \u201912-13). 5. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 12.5 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 0.8 apg Season stats: 10.1 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 1.3 apg Maybe the brisk Minnesota air has reinvigorated Gibson, who is putting up career numbers across the board. Playing a career-high 30.5 minutes, he\u2019s shooting 53.6 from the field, 83.3 from the line and hauling in 7.7 rebounds \u2014 all career bests. Gibson also already has five double-doubles, putting him on pace to break his career high of 18 double-doubles in \u201909-10.  6. Paul Millsap (32), Denver Nuggets Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 16.8 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 3.7 apg Season stats: 15.7 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.9 apg Millsap started to week in grand fashion, pouring in 27 points and nine rebounds on Nov. 3. Unfortunately, he followed that up the next night with six points and zero rebounds against the Warriors. He did, however, bounce back nicely with four straight games of 16 or more points including tying a career high with six blocks on Nov. 9 against the Thunder. 7. Trevor Ariza (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 2.1 apg Season stats: 10.8 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 2.6 apg The Rockets put up 142 points in a win over the Suns and Ariza contributed just 11 points? Huh. Despite that showing, it was still a solid two weeks for the small forward, who went for double-digit scoring in five of six games including two steals in four straight. He\u2019s also connected on at least three 3s in six of his last eight games. 8. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 10 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 15.2 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 13.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.8 apg Randolph, who has started every game this season for the Kings while averaging 25.4 minutes, is getting with the times and taking his game out beyond the arc. Before this season, the most 3-pointers Z-Bo had made in a season was 25 back in \u201908-09 with the Clippers. This season, he already has eight (8-for-20), putting him on pace for 40-45. 9. Courtney Lee (32), New York Knicks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 13.2 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 11.6 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 2.8 apg Lee has been a pleasant surprise so far this season. Starting and averaging more than 33 minutes, he\u2019s scored in double figures in four consecutive games while connecting on at least two treys in three straight. In fact, Lee has made at least two 3s in seven of 14 games and is shooting a career-high 47.2 from deep. 10. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 17.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 5.0 apg Season stats: 14.8 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 4.1 apg Redick started the stretch nicely, snatching his first 30-point game of the season (31 points with 8-for-12 3s). He followed that up with five straight games of double-figure scoring, though two of those (10 on Monday, 11 on Wednesday) left much to be desired. Much of Redick\u2019s success is tied to his long-range accuracy, which has been off in the early going (35 percent). Just missed the cut: J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver, J.J. Barea, Pau Gasol, Marcin Gortat Will turn 32 this season: Dwight Howard (Dec. 8), Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Derrick Rose, who was supposed to handle starting duties while Isaiah Thomas recovers from a hip injury, could miss three more weeks with a left ankle injury that has bothered him for a month. Rose injured the ankle Oct. 20 at Milwaukee and has missed Cleveland\u2019s past five games. The team said Friday that Rose\u2019s ankle will be immobilized for a week and he will undergo extended treatment \u201cover the next two to three weeks.\u201d In his first season with Cleveland, the 29-year-old Rose, whose promising career has been slowed by injuries in recent years, is averaging 14.3 points in seven games. The former league MVP signed with the Cavs as a free agent this summer after spending last season with the New York Knicks. Rose has shown flashes of his All-Star form, but hasn\u2019t recovered from the ankle injury. Because he\u2019s been limited and with Thomas still likely to be out another month or more before making his Cleveland debut, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue has been forced to juggle his lineups and has used LeBron James at point guard. He\u2019s also been forced to use Jeff Green and Dwyane Wade at the point. Iman Shumpert started at point guard during Cleveland\u2019s recent road trips as the Cavs went 3-1. Shumpert started again Friday night as the Cavs host the Los Angeles Clippers. \u201cWe still miss a true point guard,\u201d Lue said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard having to just try to mix and match and have Jeff play the point and D-Wade and different guys, but they\u2019ve been doing a good job of handling and we know he\u2019s going to be out for at least two weeks now so just keep continuing to plug away.\u201d There remains no clear timetable for Thomas to play.

Rob\u2019s growth as a player on both ends of the floor makes him one of the most versatile and effective wings in the league, while his contributions of character and professionalism feature prominently in our evolving organizational culture. This extension is both well-deserved, and a really great story,\u201d Colangelo said. Through 14 games this season, Covington holds averages of 16.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.5 steals in 31.1 minutes per game. His scoring average, 50 percent mark from the field and 49.5 percent mark from three-point range (eighth in the NBA) all represent career-highs. The fifth-year forward has converted on 50 three-pointers this season, which ranks fourth in the NBA and he is one of just nine players in the league with at least 20 steals and 10 blocks in 2017-18. After leading the league in deflections per game a season ago, and finishing fourth in the league\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year voting, his average of 3.4 deflections per contest this season places him fourth among NBA players. Covington is one of 14 NBA players to make at least 500 three-pointers since the start of the 2014-15 season, while his 524 three-pointers in a 76ers uniform rank fourth in franchise history, behind Hall of Famer Allen Iverson, Kyle Korver and Andre Iguodala. He has finished second on the team in steals in each of his seasons in Philadelphia and is one of 17 players league-wide with at least 350 steals in that timeframe. Just five players have both 500 threes and 350 steals in that span. Covington signed with the Sixers on Nov. 15, 2014 after being waived by Houston. In 217 games (178 starts), he holds averages of 13.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.6 steals in 28.6 minutes per game with Philadelphia.

(AP) \u2014 Memphis Grizzlies guard Mike Conley is out indefinitely with a sore left heel and Achilles tendon, leaving Mario Chalmers to start in his place at least for now. The Grizzlies updated Conley\u2019s status Friday after the guard consulted with the team\u2019s medical staff and other physicians. The team plans to have another update on his status in approximately two weeks. Conley will receive treatment and therapy to ease the soreness. The Grizzlies have no timetable for Conley\u2019s return, but Memphis coach David Fizdale said doctors think there\u2019s a good chance the soreness can be healed in two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but watching him play in pain like that and really trying to push thru that stuff was worse to watch,\u201d Fizdale said. Fizdale said Chalmers, who tore his Achilles tendon in March 2016, will start for now. The Grizzlies also have Ben McLemore and Wayne Selden, both coming off their own injuries, as potential backcourt options. Fizdale said Conley had worked so hard this summer to be ready for how the coach wants the Grizzlies playing. \u201cFor whatever reason, this thing is just not going away on its own,\u201d Fizdale said.

I wanted to come out here and put on a show, so I did,\u201d Embiid told reporters Wednesday after rampaging through the Los Angeles Lakers for a career-high 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and seven blocks. That performance piggy-backed on the back of a 32-point, 16-rebound demolition of the LA Clippers Monday , completing Embiid\u2019s takeover of the city and reminding us all that \u201cThe Process\u201d is in full effect this season. And if this is what he does to a city he loves, there\u2019s no telling what the Philadelphia 76ers big man will do if he despises your city and arena \u2026 shoutout to Hassan Whiteside . Because no one seems to enjoy the spotlight more than Embiid (just check his social media). His monster night against the Lakers continues a season-long rise for the Sixers, who are firmly entrenched in the never-too-early-to-talk-about Eastern Conference playoff chase, and cements his case for inclusion on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Embiid is averaging 23.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.9 blocks and doing it all in just 29 minutes per game. * Kia MVP Ladder (Nov. 10):  Irving hears familiar refrain The nimble behemoth has barged his way into the conversation with one eye-opening effort after another, minutes restriction be darned, but none more historically significant than the show he put on against the Lakers. Embiid recorded the highest scoring total by a Sixers player in 11 years as Hall of Famer Allen Iverson was the last to do it in 2006 . Embiid also recorded the first 40-point, seven-assist, seven-block game since Hall of Famer and Sixers icon Julius Erving did it in 1982. Since the NBA started recording blocked shots, Embiid and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are the only players to finish a game with at least 40, 15, seven and seven, and Abdul-Jabbar did it in four overtimes. Embiid needed just 34 minutes. Sixers coach Brett Brown praised Embiid\u2019s growing confidence and the growth in his game and even suggested that at least internally, they saw big things coming. \u201cWe thought it was gonna be coming at Thanksgiving,\u201d he said after the win over the Lakers. \u201cThanksgiving just happened a little bit quicker.\u201d All of it happening a bit quicker than some expected. Embiid, only 23, has played just 43 career NBA games, Saturday night\u2019s visit by the Golden State Warriors will make 44. See spotlight, insert Joel Embiid. * * * The top five in the Week 5 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  30.7 points, 10.3 assists, 4.9 rebounds Harden welcomed Chris Paul back to the lineup after 15 games away with a smashing effort \u2014 33 first-half points and 48 total in a smashing of the Phoenix Suns Thursday night . Yes, you read that right: he dropped 33 in the first half against the Suns as the Rockets piled up 90 points before the break. Harden and the Rockets moved into first place in the Western Conference standings with the win and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 loss in Boston. Most important, however, is the return of Paul to the mix. His return should ease some of the burden Harden has carried this season, not that he seems at all bothered by it. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni remembers how spent his star point guard was at the end of last season trying to do it all every night. He came into this season with a plan to share the workload between his star point guards. Now he\u2019ll finally get to see that experiment in action. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  20.6 points, 5.2 assists, 3.1 rebounds His MVP case:  Twice the Boston Celtics rallied from 17 points down to vanquish the Golden State Warriors Thursday night, with Irving scoring 11 of the Celtics\u2019 final 15 points in the game . Boston\u2019s win streak is now at 14 games and Irving is working with and without his protective mask, which means there\u2019s no doubt he has the Celtics firmly entrenched as the favorite in the Eastern Conference. He didn\u2019t come close having one of his best shooting nights against the Warriors (4-for-16 overall and 1-for-5 on 3-pointers), but he rose to the magnitude of the moment against the reigning champs. Just as impressive was his leadership, as he helped second-year forward Jaylen Brown manage on a night when he had to play after the death of his best friend . Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  25.7 points, 6.7 assists, 4.7 rebounds His MVP case:  Curry won\u2019t want anything to do with the footage of his foul-plagued performance Thursday night in Boston. It was easily his worst performance of this season (3-for-14 shooting, 2-for-9 from deep, finishing with nine points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals). The Warriors saw their seven-game win streak snapped by a Celtics team that ran its own win streak to 14 games. Curry missed Monday\u2019s win over Orlando with a thigh contusion but the Celtics had more to do with his struggles. They played an assortment of defenders on him and certainly took advantage of his foul troubles, that caused him to sit for critical stretches of the third quarter. You can bet Curry will be hunting a get back effort against the Sixers Saturday night in Philadelphia. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  30.6 points, 10.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists Antetokounmpo is finding out quickly why it will be beneficial to his game to have a point guard like Eric Bledsoe around to share the leadership burden. They haven\u2019t lost since Bledsoe arrived, running off four straight wins heading into Saturday\u2019s game against the Mavericks in Dallas, and Antetokounmpo has been able to exercise all of his muscles during this stretch. He had four of the Bucks\u2019 16 blocks in Wednesday\u2019s Central Division showdown win over Detroit, adding that to his 21 points, six rebounds and three steals. As great as he\u2019s been as a scorer early on this season, Bledsoe\u2019s presence, particularly late in games, will allow Antetokounmpo to impact games in a myriad ways going forward. If nothing else, Antetokounmpo won\u2019t always have to play the role of facilitator and best defender during crunch time. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 6 Season stats:  28.3 points, 8.7 assists, 7.3 rebounds The Cavaliers have won three straight games and four of their last five with LeBron dragging his crew along as they continue to deal with their chemistry and defensive issues. His 23 points, 12 assists, nine rebounds and late-game dagger in Monday\u2019s road win over the New York Knicks was just the latest reminder that \u2014 no matter how bleak things look for his team \u2014 there\u2019s always a chance to turn things around when James is around. He had to perform similar heroics (31 points, eight assists, six rebounds) in Wednesday\u2019s win in Charlotte , another game the could have easily gone the other way without his effort. We\u2019ll see how the Cavaliers handle a little success this season tonight, when the LA Clippers show up at Quicken Loans Arena ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). But Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue doesn\u2019t have to worry about LeBron, who is grinding away to the tune of 38-plus minutes a night, being ready. The next five: 6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 7. Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks 8. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 9. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 10. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves And five more \u2026: DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors; Tobias Harris, Detroit Pistons; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; John Wall, Washington Wizards, Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder * * * An Inside Look at Eric Bledsoe from a Western Conference scout: \u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t always been the biggest fan of his game. Not there was anything about it that I didn\u2019t like, he just didn\u2019t really strike me as dynamic a player as his profile suggested he should be over the years. Even back when he was with the Clippers, I felt like there was plenty of talent to work with there, but his game never seemed to fully develop. But I have to admit, he\u2019s a perfect fit at this time for Milwaukee and I cannot say enough about [Bucks coach Jason] Kidd and what he can do for Bledsoe\u2019s game and really just his understanding of the position and how he can unlock things for all those young guys on that roster.\u201d \u201cFirst and foremost, you out a ballhawking defender in front of all that length and defensively, it could be scary. You saw what they did to Detroit (Wednesday night). That rim protection with all that length, they can sit back and cut off all angles to the basket with the ball pressure Bledsoe provides.

They led the Celtics 15-6 after a pair of Kevin Durant free throws, and appeared to have already solved the formula Boston had used to fuel a 13-game winning streak. As they often do when the offense grinds to a halt, the Boston Celtics turned to a reliable half-court play to settle in. It worked, producing a wide-open Jaylen Brown cutting down the baseline. The second-year forward could have laid it in quickly and efficiently. He didn\u2019t. Instead he opted for a quick spin and vicious jam, with a little flourish for good measure. It was a small choice, made in the split-second it took for the play to transpire. It also set a tone, one that allowed the Celtics to survive its worst offensive night of the season against the best team in the NBA. Later in the first quarter, Brown did what few are good (or brave) enough to do: he pressured two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry into coughing up a loose ball. Just as rare, he pursued and won the possession in the kind of frenetic setting the Warriors usually feast. Brown got around Curry, controlled the ball before Zaza Pachulia could reach it, and sprinted down the other end for a tomahawk jam. Another scene from the first quarter: Brown briefly lost Durant through a maze of screens, and the reigning Finals MVP rose for the mid-range shot he normally converts without thought. He didn\u2019t count on 1) Brown not giving up on the play and 2) having the audacity to block his shot. And that\u2019s the way it went for the rest of the night. Whenever Kyrie Irving\u2019s 4-for-16 night seemed to doom them, whenever it felt Jayson Tatum\u2019s quiet showing (2-for-5 shooting) would leave Boston wanting, Brown did something to spark them. It turns out the 21-year-old wasn\u2019t just fighting the odds of scoreboard or opponent. Brown was also waging a battle with his heart, which was sorely tempted to mourn alone the loss of his best friend, who passed away on Wednesday night. \u201cI knew coming into today that he would have wanted me to play,\u201d a quietly emotional Brown told reporters after the game. \u201cAfter talking to his mom and family, they inspired me to come out and play. I wasn\u2019t in any shape to come out. I wanted to be in my room.\u201d Instead, Brown leaned on the escape of the game and the support of his teammates, rewarding both with one of the best performances of his young career. He finished with a team-high 22 points, seven rebounds, two blocks and two steals in 34 minutes of action. The effort was instrumental in extending Boston\u2019s win streak to a league-best 14 games while also halting the Warriors\u2019 own seven-game streak of dominance. All of that was, of course, a footnote to the individual more focused on personal loss than the results of a game. Brown remembered clearly when his friend, Trevin Steede, reached out to him when he was a new transfer in high school, too introverted to make new friends. \u201cHe walked up to me the third or fourth day and asked who I was sitting with [at lunch], even though I wasn\u2019t sitting with anybody,\u201d Brown recalled with a slight break in his voice. \u201cHe told me to come over and sit with him.\u201d After helping his team clinch its biggest victory yet, Brown let the knowledge that Steede was no longer there to sit with wash over him. Like that not-so-long ago day in high school, however, someone was there to reach out to him. It was Irving, embracing him after the final buzzer sounded, letting him know that others were there to fill the hole left in his life. \u201cI\u2019ve lost individuals in my life. It\u2019s never a good thing when someone else is going through it,\u201d Irving said afterward, via MassLife.com . \u201cYou do your best to console and to encourage them, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about the strength within themselves and he showed a lot of that tonight, to be able to go out there and perform the way he did, I knew exactly where the game ball was going to.\u201d Facing a 17-point deficit, the defending champions, and the loss of a friend, there is no doubt that Brown earned it."},{"id":43162,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-says-looking-very-likely-boston-celtics","date":"2017-11-17","title":"Stephen Curry: 'Very likely' that Warriors, Celtics face off in Finals","content":"Stephen Curry knows who has owned the Eastern Conference for the last three years.

Obviously, until they beat Cleveland, who has done it three years in a row, we\u2019ll see. I hear the weather\u2019s great [in Boston] in June, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d If the playoffs were to start today, the Celtics would have a healthy claim to the No. 1 seed. They currently hold the best record in the league at 14-2, and boast the best defensive stats in the league. Boston has accomplished this despite losing All-Star free agent signee Gordon Hayward to a broken ankle on opening night. They have also endured shorter-term injuries to Kyrie Irving (facial fracture) and Al Horford (concussion). The Celtics have risen above those challenges, enough, even, to erase a 17-point deficit to the defending champs on Thursday night in front of a national television audience.

The only games the Celtics have lost have were the game in which Gordon Hayward broke his ankle and the game they played the following night . There have been some close calls along the way ( 10 of their 15 games have been within five points in the last five minutes ), but Boston is taking a 13-game winning streak and the league\u2019s best defense into the most anticipated game of the early season. The Golden State Warriors are bringing their own streak \u2014 seven wins by an average of 19.8 points \u2014 to TD Garden for the first the first game of tonight\u2019s TNT double-header. Pace : 98.9 (22nd) OffRtg : 103.6 (19th) DefRtg : 95.8 (1st) NetRtg : +7.8 (2nd) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders   The Celtics are the only team that, vs. the league average, has improved in regard to each of the four factors on defense.      Celtics opponents are shooting worse, getting to the line less often, turning the ball mover more and grabbing fewer offensive rebounds than they did last season. The Los Angeles Lakers can say the same, but their increase in opponent turnover rate (+0.8 turnovers per 100 possessions) is less than the league average (+1.4).  On both ends of the floor, shooting is the most important thing. The Celtics\u2019 No. 1 ranking on defense starts with having the lowest opponent effective field goal percentage.  And the key to that has been on the perimeter. The Celtics rank second in opponent field goal percentage from mid-range and fourth in opponent 3-point percentage .  On top of that, their opponents have taken only 31 percent of their shots, the sixth lowest rate in the league, from 3-point range. And on top of that , only 19 percent of their opponents\u2019 3-point shots, the fifth lowest rate, have come from the corners. So not only have the Celtics defended 3-pointers well, but they\u2019ve done well in preventing them and preventing the more effective ones.  Through Wednesday, the league has shot 38.6 percent on corner threes and 35.7 percent on above-the-break threes. That difference (2.9 percent) is a little less than what it\u2019s been over the past five seasons.   This is the seventh straight season in which the league has taken a greater percentage of its shots from 3-point range than it did the season before. The Celtics\u2019 defense is one of nine that has reduced the percentage of its opponents\u2019 shots that have come from beyond the arc from last season to this season.  Of course, the Celtics ranked fifth in opponent effective field goal percentage last season , with their 3-point defense being an important factor. Amazingly, if they stay there, this would be the 11th straight season that Boston has ranked in the top five in opponent 3-point percentage, a stretch that began with their 2007-08 championship season.  While they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s third biggest drop in opponent effective field goal percentage, it\u2019s been the other areas of defense where the Celtics have gone from below-average last season to above-average this season, with rebounding being the most remarkable turnaround.  Al Horford has grabbed 24 percent of available defensive rebounds, his highest rate since his second season in the league and up from 18.3 percent last season. But the Celtics\u2019 rebounding improvement goes beyond Horford.  Avery Bradley is a good rebounding guard, but the Celtics\u2019 starting shooting guard this season (Jaylen Brown) has a higher defensive rebounding percentage ( 17.6 percent ) than Bradley did last season ( 16.1 percent ). The same goes for Kyrie Irving (8.8 percent) and Isaiah Thomas (7.0 percent).  Last season, the Celtics\u2019 starting backcourt was 5-foot-9 and 6-foot-2. This season, their starting backcourt is 6-foot-3 and 6-foot-7. At small forward, Jayson Tatum (6-foot-8) is bigger than Jae Crowder (6-foot-6). That\u2019s a big difference in height on the perimeter and it makes a big difference in every aspect of defense, not just rebounding.  This defensive improvement is coming with a 21-year-old (Brown) and a 19-year-old (Tatum) leading the team in minutes . But size has turned out to be more important than age.  Bigger bodies and longer arms will obviously shrink passing lanes and create more turnovers. More important, the Celtics\u2019 added size allows them to more liberally switch screens. That has allowed them to more often keep the ball in front of them and stay out of rotation, which helps them do a better job of defending the 3-point line, avoiding fouls, and rebounding.  \u201cThat\u2019s a huge thing that everybody wants to be able to do,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve put a huge premium on it, obviously, in drafting Jaylen, Jayson and Semi [Ojeleye]. Those guys all can guard multiple positions.\u201d  Switching is easier said than done. It requires constant communication. And no team will test the Celtics\u2019 ability to switch successfully more than the Warriors will tonight. Golden State has seen and beat every kind of defensive scheme. Golden State is also a challenge, because the Celtics\u2019 defense has been best when they\u2019ve have played biggest. They\u2019ve allowed a ridiculously low 84 points per 100 possessions in 131 minutes with Al Horford and Aron Baynes on the floor together . But Stevens has been willing to go with different looks to start games when the matchup has dictated it. Against Brooklyn on Tuesday, Marcus Morris started and Baynes played just 12 minutes. The Celtics haven\u2019t had the toughest schedule in regard to opponent offensive strength. Thursday\u2019s game against Golden State will be just their fourth against a team that currently ranks in the top 10 in offensive efficiency . They\u2019ve played twice as many games against the bottom 10 (six) as they have against the top 10 (three). Time will tell if the defense can remain as stout as it has been through the first four weeks of the season. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve just done some good things early and we\u2019ll taper off,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd maybe we won\u2019t.\u201d Here\u2019s an after-timeout possession from Tuesday where Brooklyn sets a double-pin-down screen for Allen Crabbe, who slips a screen for Spencer Dinwiddie. The ever-alert Horford sees Crabbe ( the No. 2 3-point shooter in the league last season ) break free and switches out. Brown switches onto Horford\u2019s man (Trevor Booker) but then switches again with Marcus Morris when Booker heads to the paint. Brown then switches with Irving on a Spencer Dinwiddie-Rondae Hollis-Jefferson ball screen, Tatum and Morris switch off the ball in the right corner, and Brown ultimately contests a Dinwiddie three with four seconds left on the shot clock.   1. The Celtics have scored 111 points per 100 possessions in the second half of games .   That ranks as the league\u2019s second best second-half offense and is an increase from the 96 points per 100 possessions ( third worst ) the Celtics have scored in the first half of games.  In the first half, the Celtics have scored at the rate of the third worst offense in the league. In the second half, they\u2019ve scored at the rate of the second best offense.  Overall, the Celtics rank 19th offensively , having scored 5.0 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season (when they ranked eighth). Only two teams (Sacramento and Utah) have seen a bigger drop in effective field goal percentage from 2016-17 to \u201917-18, and no team has seen a bigger drop in the percentage of its shots that have come from 3-point range ( from 39.3 percent to 35.5 percent ).    Horford and Irving have actually shot slightly better in the first half of games. But almost every one of their teammates has shot much better in the second half.  Both their 3-point percentage and the percentage of shots they have taken from 3-point range have been higher after halftime. They\u2019ve also cut down on turnovers and gone to the line more often in the second half of games.  The Celtics\u2019 defense has been good enough in the first half that they haven\u2019t fallen into many holes; They\u2019ve trailed only three of their 15 games by double-digits. But their defense has also been better after halftime.  Amazingly, the Celtics\u2019 third-quarter NetRtg of plus-25.0 points per 100 possessions doesn\u2019t lead the league . The team they\u2019re playing on Thursday has outscored its opponents by 28.2 points per 100 possessions in the third.  2. Jayson Tatum has shot 19-for-35 (56 percent) on catch-and-shoot threes. .  That\u2019s the second best mark among 157 players with at least 25 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts , trailing only that of J.J. Barea (20-for-32).  Tatum has also shot a solid 42 percent on shots between the restricted area and the 3-point line. His restricted area field goal percentage (56 percent) is below the league average, but he\u2019s made up for that by getting to the line 41 times for every 100 shots from the field. That free throw rate ranks 19th among 157 players with at least 100 field goal attempts.  Tatum\u2019s effective field goal percentage of 57.9 percent ranks 25th among that same group (just a tick behind that of Stephen Curry) and is pretty remarkable for a rookie that plays on the perimeter. In fact, only one guard or small forward has shot better on at least 500 shots over his full rookie season.    John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

A 10-3 mark out of the gate is stunning, no matter the opposition, for the Pistons. I love Avery Bradley and what he brings to any team, but his presence alone can\u2019t explain how Tobias Harris is playing at an All-Star pace and how Andre Drummond has improved so significantly from the foul line (though he is beginning to regress from his ridiculous numbers the first week\/week and a half). But, the Pistons\u2019 upcoming schedule is formidable: at Milwaukee tonight, a Minnesota\/Cleveland back-to-back next Sunday and Monday and road games at OKC, Boston, Philly, Washington, San Antonio and Milwaukee through the first week of December \u2014 followed by home tilts with Golden State and Boston. Yikes. Steve Aschburner : If someone had told you a month ago the Detroit Pistons would win 10 of their first 13 games , you would have raised a hand, stopped him in mid-sentence and politely asked if you could switch the conversation to Russian election conspiracies. But it\u2019s true, and the Pistons\u2019 happy back-to-back set out West a couple weeks back (beating the LA Clippers and the Golden State Warriors) isn\u2019t the only reason. Point guard Reggie Jackson is healthy, forward Tobias Harris is East player of the week-worthy with a burgeoning 3-point game and center Andre Drummond is playing up to his max contract now. Detroit\u2019s offensive improvement unexpectedly makes it a Top 10 team on both ends. Now if only folks would show up in greater numbers to new Little Caesars Arena ; a team that\u2019s 7-1 at home should rank higher than 13th in NBA attendance. Shaun Powell :  The Cavaliers sitting at the break-even point is the choice , mainly because they\u2019re in the East. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a surprise if they had embarked on a long West Coast trip and got snagged by a bit of unfortunate scheduling, but not this. They didn\u2019t lose their seventh game last season until Dec. 26 , one day after beating the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, curiously on a Kyrie Irving buzzer beater. John Schuhmann :  The Boston Celtics have won 13 straight games \u2026 and the Detroit Pistons are just one game in the loss column behind them in the Eastern Conference. Before the season, I had the Sixers edging out the Pistons for a playoff spot , believing that Detroit would be improved, but still not sure that both Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond would rebound from last season. They\u2019ve done that and Tobias Harris has been terrific. The Pistons have had one of the easier schedules in the East, so we\u2019ll know more about them in mid-December. Nine of their next 11 games are on the road and 10 of their next 14 are against other teams that currently have winning records. Still, how sharp they\u2019ve been so far, with their win at Golden State obviously being the highlight, is a pleasant surprise.  Sekou Smith :  Five minutes into the season things appeared bleak for the Boston Celtics . Gordon Hayward\u2019s season was over and a team that had earned the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference the previous season and played in the conference finals was no longer identifiable. Two losses later, people starting writing the Celtics\u2019 obit for this season, relegating them to a playoff hopeful rather than a contender. Some 13 straight wins later, the first time in NBA history a team that started 0-2 has run off this many consecutive wins , it\u2019s fair to discuss the Celtics as the best team in basketball. The best test, though, comes Thursday night on TNT, when the reigning champion Golden State Warriors hit TD Garden. Still, what Brad Stevens and his crew have done in the wake of that devastating Hayward injury is nothing short of remarkable. * * *"},{"id":43170,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-defensive-surprise-so-far-2017-18-season","date":"2017-11-15","title":"Blogtable: Biggest defensive surprise so far in 2017-18?","content":" * * * Thinking only in terms of defense, what\u2019s the biggest surprise of the season so far?  * * * David Aldridge :  That the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 108.4 Defensive Rating ) continue to struggle so much at that end of the floor. I thought Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague alone would stamp out many of the Wolves\u2019 problems on D, and that Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins would improve through repetition and the occasional Tom Thibodeau harangue. But Towns seems to be regressing rather than progressing. His Win Shares, per basketball-reference.com, have fallen through the floor (2.8 last season to 0.4 this season). With all those young legs, Butler\u2019s pedigree and Thibodeau\u2019s track record, Minnesota should just be better defensively than it is. But it isn\u2019t. Steve Aschburner : We all expected more firepower from the Boston Celtics this season, what with the additions of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. But it figured to come at the expense of their defense, with the departures of Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder in particular. Yet lookee here: Boston has shaved double digits off its defensive efficiency to vault from 12th last season to first so far in 2017-18 . The Celtics rank first in defensive field-goal percentage (42.9 vs. 45.0 last season), including 32.8 from the arc. Al Horford has been helpful as a mobile big, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum give coach Brad Stevens a pair of young, long forwards to contest shots inside and out, and guard Marcus Smart is shooting too much for a guy making 28 percent, but if that\u2019s the price the Celtics pay for his 11.3 net rating and the havoc he can wreak guarding multiple spots, so be it. Shaun Powell :  I believe the Boston Celtics\u2019 defense is the runaway answer to this question. Let me get this straight: You trade your best defenders in Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder, add Kyrie Irving and his rep for being the softest defensive point guard in the NBA, and one game into the season lose a fairly good defender in Gordon Hayward \u2026 and you\u2019re giving up a league-low 94 points? John Schuhmann : Last week, I wrote about the Lakers\u2019 defense, which has since moved up to No. 4 in defensive efficiency , having held their last four opponents to just 96 points per 100 possessions . At the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019s hard not to be continually disappointed in the Wolves\u2019 defense, which ranks in the bottom five for the third straight season and the second straight season under Tom Thibodeau. Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson have only been able to do so much and Karl-Anthony Towns continues to be a liability on that end of the floor more often than not. The Wolves rank 26th defensively having played twice as many games against bottom-10 offenses (six) than top-10 offenses (three).  Sekou Smith : I understand that the Cleveland Cavaliers are dealing with issues that go far beyond whatever metrics they have piled up this season. The departure of Kyrie Irving over the summer altered this team\u2019s DNA. And, yes, I know it\u2019s LeBron\u2019s team \u2026 but Kyrie\u2019s role and fit was integral to what made them tick. But losing Kyrie and adding capable and defensive-minded veterans, in some cases, led me to believe that the Cavaliers wouldn\u2019t see any significant drop off in their defensive prowess. To see them rank last in the league in Defensive Rating right now explains a lot about what ails these Cavaliers. Their focus on that part of the game has been non-existent. If they can\u2019t win a shootout, they\u2019re cooked. They were a bottom 10 team last season, but I\u2019m surprised they have gone to the defensive sunken place so far this season. * * *"},{"id":43176,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-offensive-surprise-so-far-2017-18-season","date":"2017-11-15","title":"Blogtable: Biggest offensive surprise so far in 2017-18?","content":" * * * Thinking only in terms of offense, what\u2019s the biggest surprise of the season so far?  * * * David Aldridge :  For me, it\u2019s still Orlando, which has done a 180 from last year\u2019s points-challenged squad (101.1 ppg, 24th in the league last season; 109.8 ppg, seventh in the league this season). Yes, the Magic added Jonathan Simmons, Marreese Speights and Shelvin Mack. And Simmons has given Orlando a lift off the bench (15 ppg). But none of those players were (and are) thought of as dynamic offensive talents. They don\u2019t explain how Aaron Gordon has gone from shooting 28.8 percent on 3-pointers last season to 51.9 percent this season , or Nikola Vucevic going from 30.7 percent behind the arc last season to 40.3 percent this season . Give both the players and Orlando\u2019s coaching and development staff credit for improving from within rather than throwing major free agent bucks at the problem. Steve Aschburner : OK, free throws aren\u2019t the most exciting plays \u2014 wait, they\u2019re actually among the most boring. But that doesn\u2019t mean Andre Drummond\u2019s improvement from 38.1 percent in his first five NBA seasons to this season\u2019s relative nose-bleed heights, 63.2 so far, isn\u2019t notable. Working over the summer with trainer Idan Ravin, Drummond got in better shape overall, then tweaked things all the way down to his breathing at the line. His percentage got dinged by an 0-for-7 night against the Pacers last week, but the Pistons won that game. And a 66 percent improvement in any offensive category \u2013 from Drummond\u2019s old rate to his current one \u2013 is remarkable, however boring. Shaun Powell :  Yes, he\u2019s getting more shots with Carmelo Anthony out of town. But Kristaps Porzingis is has raised his scoring average by more than 10 points a game from 2016-17. That\u2019s not a jump, that\u2019s a triple-jump, and fairly rare in the NBA. The biggest reason is the quality of his shots, not just the quantity. He finally ditched the idea of being a stretch five \u2014 which is silly for someone with his 7-foot-3 height \u2014 and is finding comfort near the rim where he has mismatches, and at mid-range ( he\u2019s shooting 49.8 percent, up nearly eight percent from his rookie season ). I love the idea of Kristaps using his height in the right way and being a threat everywhere on the floor, not just beyond the stripe John Schuhmann : The Boston Celtics have struggled offensively at times, especially when they haven\u2019t had both Kyrie Irving and Al Horford on the floor, but Jayson Tatum has been a rare rookie perimeter player who has scored efficiently. Through Tuesday, Tatum has a true shooting percentage of 63.4 percent, the 18th best mark among 150 players who have taken at least 100 shots from the field . The Celtics have put him in positions to succeed, with most of his offense coming against a defense in rotation, but no other rookie (and very few in recent memory) could take advantage of those situations as well as Tatum has. He has shot well off the catch ( he ranks third in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage among players with at least 25 attempts ), he has a solid, one-dribble pull-up jumper, and he can get to the basket and to the line, ranking 20th in free throw rate (41 attempts per 100 shots from the field) among those same 150 players who have taken at least 100 shots. There\u2019s no hesitation when he attacks close-outs. He reads the defense well and knows where he\u2019s going with the ball.  Sekou Smith :  Giannis Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t yet what anyone would call a polished offensive player, and yet he\u2019s leading the league in scoring at 31.3 points per game . Consider me surprised. And not just that he\u2019s done it, but at the way he\u2019s doing it. He doesn\u2019t thrive on a steady dose of 3-point attempts, like many other of the league\u2019s top scorers. And he\u2019s not a back-to-the-basket big man feeding off of a large amount of post up plays. Seeing him emerge as a 23-point scorer by the end of his fourth season was a natural progression that made plenty of sense. But to cross that 30-point plateau now, and to do it the way he has, certainly strikes as one of the more pleasant offensive surprises of this early season. If he finishes the season leading the league in scoring and anywhere in the neighborhood of 30 or more points per game, then \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d world takeover is upon us. * * * * * *"},{"id":43175,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-kawhi-leonard-back-sooner-rather-later-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2017-11-15","title":"Gregg Popovich says Kawhi Leonard will be back 'sooner rather than later'","content":" Last anyone heard about All-Star and all-world forward Kawhi Leonard, it was coach Gregg Popovich saying Leonard getting through injury rehab work was more \u2018difficult\u2019 than expected .

Not only did LeBron lead an epic revival, helping the Cleveland Cavaliers overcome a 23-point deficit to stun the New York Knicks 104-101 , but emotions boiled over between him and the Knicks\u2019 Enes Kanter. The pair were both assessed technical fouls in the first quarter after Kanter came to the defense of rookie Frank Ntilikina, who was bumping chests with James. According to ESPN.com\u2019s Dave McMenamin, Kanter had this to say about defending Ntilikina and his first-quarter exchange with James : After the game, Ntilikina shrugged off his confrontation with James. The French point guard had been the topic of discussion this week after James said Dallas Mavericks rookie Dennis Smith Jr. \u201cshould be a Knick.\u201d (New York took Ntilikina one pick earlier, at No. 8.) Before last night\u2019s game, LeBron addressed his Ntilikina-Smith Jr. comments, saying he wasn\u2019t \u2018throwing shade\u2019 at the Knicks\u2019 top rookie. James also took some shots at Kanter , who had defended Ntilikina in the days after James\u2019 comments. After the game, Kanter took a shot at LeBron, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, this team is really special. You ain\u2019t coming to my house and playing that water bottle flip game again. I don\u2019t care who you are. What do you call yourself, \u2018King,\u2019 \u2018Queen,\u2019 \u2018Princess,\u2019 whatever you are. We\u2019re going to fight. Nobody out there is going to punk us. We went out there and played our game. We\u2019re going to go out there and get better every day.\u201d When told of Kanter\u2019s comments, LeBron responded with the real royalty: \u201cWell, I\u2019m the King, my wife is the Queen and my daughter\u2019s the Princess, so we\u2019ve got all three covered.\u201d Last season, James and several of his teammates flipped water bottles at the end of the bench late in Cleveland\u2019s 126-94 win against the Knicks. Kanter at that time was still playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder. James also got in a final shot on former Knicks president Phil Jackson after the game, too, writes McMenamin. James admitted before last night\u2019s game that Jackson was the target of his comments in the Ntilikina-Smith Jr. discussion. All of this back and forth followed an enormous comeback from the Cavs, in which they erased a 23-point deficit \u2014 15 to start the fourth quarter \u2014 by scoring 43 in the final period.

Sometimes if someone takes that away from you, you\u2019ve got to get in your feelings for a reason.\u201d Gobert woke up Saturday with unexpected stiffness and swelling in the leg. An MRI revealed a bruised right tibia. The 2016-17 second-team All-NBA center said it could have been worse and he\u2019s happy to know he\u2019ll fully recover with no ligament or structural damage. The rehab process is basically to get the swelling down and stay strong and in shape. Playoff aspirations and individual goals remain intact, though they will be much more difficult for Utah to achieve. The Jazz have now lost Gobert for a month, Joe Johnson (wrist) has yet to return and was expected to miss a month, and Dante Exum is out for the season after shoulder surgery.

He was the new kid and, at age 21, his rookie trek through the NBA was one hard lesson after another. Kidd, after two seasons as the preternatural floor leader at Cal, realized quickly he wasn\u2019t in college anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re playing against men,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job, and there are men out there that are trying to embarrass you. So you had to understand that and you had to be prepared, and probably use that fear to help you have some success. That was the biggest thing, besides y\u2019know, 82 games \u2013 no matter rookie or not, you\u2019re not prepared to play that many games at a very high level.\u201d Especially not against elite competition. For Kidd, that meant Nets point guard Kenny Anderson, who hung 30 points and nine assists on Kidd in the rookie\u2019s debut. A month later, it was Utah\u2019s John Stockton going for 18 and 12 to the young guy\u2019s 3 and 3 with four turnovers. Shortly before Christmas, Kidd got outplayed on consecutive nights by Seattle\u2019s Gary Payton and Portland\u2019s Rod Strickland. On the other side of the holiday, it was Phoenix\u2019s Kevin Johnson in a home-and-home with Kidd\u2019s Dallas team, outscoring the rookie by a combined 48-18 while producing 18 assists and five turnovers to Kidd\u2019s 27 and 12. \u201cThey know the tricks,\u201d Kidd said of the salty veterans every newbie faces. \u201cAnd for a rookie, you\u2019re just out there playing on straight adrenaline and talent, and not knowing how to win until you get older.\u201d Kidd\u2019s fast break down memory lane was triggered by Lonzo Ball\u2019s arrival in Milwaukee for the Lakers\u2019 game at the BMO Harris Bradley Center Saturday night. The extreme hype that has accompanied the L.A. rookie through the season\u2019s first four weeks came along to the chilly Midwest, even if father LaVar wasn\u2019t in the house. The thing is, Ball\u2019s performance against the Bucks exceeded the hype. With 19 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists, Ball became the youngest player in NBA history \u2013 20 years, 15 days \u2013 to post a triple-double. He added three steals and four blocked shots to go with four turnovers in nearly 39 minutes, and made seven of his 12 shots (including three of five 3-pointers) with that unorthodox, start-left, release-right shooting form. Ball began the night shooting 29.2 percent overall and 22.2 from the arc, struggles that have been cited constantly as a liability for both him and the Lakers. But his teammates, so often the beneficiaries of Ball\u2019s slick passing and uncanny court vision, have had his back through the misses and the clangs. \u201cEven if he\u2019s in a shooting slump, he\u2019s always shooting,\u201d said wing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d Ball remains unflappable on the matter. He knows the other things he does on the floor, and he sincerely seems to have his focus set on winning. Ball also knows that, in three games to open November against Portland, Brooklyn and Memphis, he was plus-10, plus-21 and plus-10 while shooting 6-of-30. And the Lakers went 2-1. \u201cI\u2019m gonna keep shooting,\u201d Ball said after the 98-90 loss to the Bucks . \u201cMy confidence is going to stay the same all year. I\u2019ve been shooting all my life.\u201d Meanwhile Kidd, who was a 12-year veteran and seven-time All-Star before he logged two consecutive seasons of shooting 33.8 percent on 3-pointers, sounded a little protective of the precocious playmaker. \u201cBall can play,\u201d the Milwaukee coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna make his teammates better, he\u2019s gonna make his team better. The triple-double, that\u2019s gonna be the norm for him. He\u2019s gonna fill up stats sheets. We\u2019ve just got to give him time. People are trying to put him in the microwave and speed him up. He\u2019s gonna make mistakes. He\u2019s gonna have bad nights. But he competes and he\u2019s going to find a way to win.\u201d Kidd added: \u201cIt takes time. When you\u2019re a pass-first guy, shooting is second or third. You\u2019re trying to make your teammates better. You\u2019re trying to make the game easy for those guys who score the ball. For Ball or for myself, it would be, \u2018Don\u2019t worry what you shoot. Are you winning games?\u2019 That\u2019s what you\u2019re being measured for. When was it, Kidd was asked, that he finally felt comfortable launching 3-pointers? \u201cAfter I retired,\u201d he said. \u201cNo pressure.\u201d * * * Eric Bledsoe had played in only three games before being traded Tuesday by Phoenix to Milwaukee \u2013 and none at all during the 20-day, unplanned sabbatical the Suns had given him after he Tweeted (\u201cI Don\u2019t wanna be here\u201d) about geographic and occupational preferences deemed out of step with the team\u2019s mission. The 6-foot-1, eighth-year guard had just resumed using the Suns\u2019 practice facility for solo workouts, in fact, when the gripe for which he was fined $10,000 earned him his ticket out. Bledsoe caught up with the Bucks in San Antonio, played more than 28 minutes on Friday, then hopped on their flight and logged another 31-plus minutes against L.A. Saturday. All of the Bucks were tuckered from the back-to-back turnaround, but for stretches against the Lakers, Bledsoe looked somewhere between taking that first punch from Mike Tyson and taking the last. \u201cI thought it was going to be easy,\u201d Bledsoe said, smiling, after his new-home debut. \u201cI thought I\u2019d do better. \u2026 We did a great job as a team closing them out. Some games are going to be like this.\u201d Bledsoe\u2019s two-night line was modest: 24 points, nine assists, eight turnovers, six rebounds and 10-for-28 shooting, including 1-for-11 on 3-pointers. But he\u2019s almost 60 minutes more familiar with Milwaukee than he was, as they prepare to face Memphis Monday and navigate from there the 69 games remaining. \u201cSometimes [getting thrown into heavy action is] actually a good way,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just basketball. We talked about, \u2018Just be yourself. We\u2019re going to put you in situations that you\u2019re accustomed to. And play to your strengths.\u2019 \u201cI thought for the 48 hours that he\u2019s played, he\u2019s been himself, attacking, getting to the basket, finding teammates, rebounding. \u2026 He\u2019s just showing he can do a lot more than score the ball. I think he helped our tempo at both ends, defensively and offensively.\u201d Bledsoe\u2019s energy and physical play was evident, and productive defensively, in the fourth quarter against the Lakers. In one sequence, he sold a moving pick on Julius Randle to thwart L.A.\u2019s possession and add to its pile of turnovers 23 high. He missed a jump shot, but got the ball back at the other end by diving defensively and calling for a timeout before falling across the baseline. Bledsoe, from his time with the Suns, is no stranger to multiple point guard sets. So there wasn\u2019t much learning curve for him when Kidd sent in Malcolm Brogdon and\/or Matthew Dellavedova for variations of small ball. \u201cSometimes the ball isn\u2019t always going to bounce your way,\u201d Bledsoe said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to find a way to affect the game. That\u2019s what I learned playing off the ball. You\u2019ve got to find ways to affect the game, whether it\u2019s key stops, key plays, anything.\u201d Bledsoe did get a crash course in playing with one of the NBA\u2019s Flavors of the Month, early MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo. His biggest takeaway? \u201cRunning the floor,\u201d the point guard said. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of player who can bring the ball up the court. I haven\u2019t played with a player that tall bringing the ball up the court. That\u2019s what I\u2019d learned playing against him, he\u2019s a jack of all trades. He can pretty much do everything.\u201d Antetokounmpo, by the way, said he welcomed Bledsoe as another reliable ball handler and offense initiator who can spare him some wear and tear fighting up court with the basketball \u2013 yet give it back when it\u2019s Greek Freak time. Bledsoe, asked if the trade, the grind of his first two games and an abrupt relocation to Milwaukee had combined for an emotional week for him, shook his head. \u201cNah. It\u2019s basketball at the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cand we love doing it. We want to be here.\u201d Hmm, sounded vaguely Tweetable. * * * Bledsoe had time for his emotions to simmer down after his Suns estrangement, but Brogdon did not. There had been rumors, some of which had him moving too. But when the smoke cleared, he went from the Bucks\u2019 starting point guard building on his NBA 2017 Rookie of the Year season to one of two point guards coming off Milwaukee\u2019s bench. There appeared to be a little pout in Brogdon\u2019s play in the opening minutes at San Antonio. Since then, however, he has humming along, playing no differently than if he\u2019d been on the floor since tipoff. After the victory over the Lakers \u2013 in which he played 33 minutes, scoring 23 points with three rebounds, three assists and three steals \u2013 Brogdon admitted he had just endured a few emotional days. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a guy who started in the playoffs last year and earned the starting spot, it\u2019s been an adjustment for me, moving to the bench. But I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s confident enough and team-oriented enough, I\u2019ll come off the bench and give what the team needs. I\u2019m just going to get it done.\u201d Do you do it for the team or do you do it because that\u2019s who you are? The former might still be grudging, the latter a more clean break from ego. \u201cI think I do it for the team because that\u2019s who I am,\u201d Brogdon said, combining the two to win that word-play challenge. \u201cWho I am is a guy who\u2019s going to do whatever the team needs. Right now, I think the team needs me to come off the bench and be really aggressive.\u201d Some players would draw motivation from showing the coaches and management that they didn\u2019t need the perceived upgrade at the point. Brogdon, well, he wouldn\u2019t cop to that. \u201cI just go out there to show them I\u2019m going to play the right way regardless of what position or what situation I\u2019m in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to play the right way, I\u2019m going to know my role and I\u2019m going to be who I am.\u201d That said, there seemed to be a little extra statement at the end of the third quarter when Brogdon cut and took a pass from Antetokounmpo. He went all the way up and slammed over Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma, almost as emphatically as when Brogdon dunked against Kyrie Irving and LeBron James last December when he mostly was known as an overripe (then 24), undervalued (second round, No. 36 overall) four-year product of Virginia. Bledsoe, whose dressing stall is next to Brogdon\u2019s in the home locker room, knows he was handed the less-experienced player\u2019s spot with essentially no on-court competition. Of the past 10 Rookies of the Year, only Tyreke Evans and Michael Carter-Williams have been turned into reserves, Evans more successfully than Carter-Williams. So it\u2019s not a prestige move for winners of that particular award. \u201cI just tell Malcolm to stay aggressive,\u201d Bledsoe said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to need everybody. This is going to be a good run for us, so we just have to make the most of it. \u2026 I did it before. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done it. It\u2019s challenging, but at the same time, you\u2019ve got to find a way.\u201d Kidd cited Dellavedova as a good example of a player morphing to fit a team\u2019s circumstances. He started for the Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals alongside James against Golden State and now, a little more than two years later, he\u2019s third on Milwaukee\u2019s depth chart at his position. \u201cDelly\u2019s been in that situation in Cleveland, playing with their stars and being asked to do something different,\u201d the Bucks coach said. \u201cHe just knows one way and that\u2019s to play hard. If he starts he\u2019s gonna play hard, if he comes off the bench he\u2019s gonna play hard.\u201d Besides, two- or three-guard lineups have become de rigueur in the modern NBA. With Antetokounmpo\u2019s ball skills and ability to break down defenses, having more guys who can spot around the 3-point line for his kick-outs is essential too. \u201cIt gives us a whole new look,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cTwo starting caliber point guards coming off the bench, that\u2019s huge. \u201cThat allows us to be more versatile. We don\u2019t have to have one dominant ball handler. We can have three or four. That allows us to have more good decision makers on the floor.\u201d Making decisions, organizing an attack, massaging a game are all things on which Brogdon prides himself. They are strengths he sees in Ball as well, to bring this full circle to a newcomer who can only tie, not surpass, Brogdon on the Rookie of the Year ladder. \u201cHe has a great feel,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI think, as a rookie what guys needs to be judged on most coming in the league is feel. Not skill, not shooting, not stats, not even passing. But that feel for the game, the ability to read situations and make the right play. And I think he\u2019s a guy who does that better than almost any other rookie. That\u2019s how I was \u2013 I prided myself on making the right play.\u201d Or the right move, as the case may be.

We\u2019re creeping toward the 1\/4 mark of the season (we\u2019re about 16 percent done with the season), when most teams have played 20 games and the standings start to hold some significance. Some teams are still in early-season mode, trying to figure things out on one end of the floor or the other. Some can book their tickets to the 2018 Draft Lottery already. And some have hit their stride. The Boston Celtics have won 12 straight games, their longest winning streak in almost seven years. They\u2019ve shown remarkable resilience in the face of injuries and some feisty teams that want to put that streak to an end. But the Celtics aren\u2019t the only team that\u2019s streaking. Entering Week 5, the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have each won six straight games, while the Detroit Pistons have won five straight. Though the Celtics haven\u2019t lost in 25 days, Detroit is just a game behind them in the loss column . The Celtics have built their streak on defense, while the Rockets and Pistons have been stronger on offense. The Warriors, meanwhile, have been elite on both ends of the floor over the last two weeks. At least one of those streaks will end this week, as Golden State visits Boston on Thursday ( 8 ET, TNT ), easily the most anticipated game of the season thus far. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 101.2 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 104.1 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

But, already down 18 to the Houston Rockets early in the second quarter on Thursday , the Cleveland Cavaliers had to find five guys that could actually stay in front of their opponents. If injuries have been the main story of their up and down season so far, their defensive dysfunction has been the B story, the part of the sitcom structure involving a secondary character \u2014 which could be why Jeff Green wound up right in the middle of one of the NBA\u2019s most successful episodic series. Cleveland is 30th in the league in Defensive Rating (112 points per 100 possessions), continuing a trend that saw the Cavs plummet to 29th in the defensive rankings the second half of last season . It didn\u2019t matter as Cleveland strafed the Eastern Conference en route to a third straight Finals appearance, because the Golden State Warriors ripped the Cavs\u2019 D apart in The Finals, putting them on skates with actions they weren\u2019t used to guarding . The Cavs\u2019 D has stayed bad this season. In the last six games, per NBA.com\/Stats, they\u2019re 24th in the league in fast break points allowed and 26th in points in the paint allowed . The latter is certainly related to the absence of Tristan Thompson, who coach Tyronn Lue had put back in the starting lineup earlier this month, only to see him go down with a calf injury that will keep him out several weeks . That puts Kevin Love back in at center, a position that wears him down physically over the long haul. But Cleveland doesn\u2019t have many roster options at present, which is why Green\u2019s play in Houston raised a cockle or two of hope. There are nights when Green still looks like the fifth pick in the Draft , which he was, back in 2007. But, most of his career, he\u2019s hit a ceiling of a solid role player, as he\u2019s been for the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder and other contenders over the years. This, though, was one of the former nights. Against the Rockets, Green was suddenly unstoppable offensively \u2014 posting, shooting, filling the lanes in transition \u2014 en route to 20 second-quarter points . More important, though, was his ability to guard James Harden effectively on switches, staying in front of the MVP candidate time and time again, and making him shoot over length. Cleveland\u2019s lineup of Green, James, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert and Dwyane Wade got the Cavs back in the game, and Cleveland\u2019s team defense against Harden was as good as anyone could expect \u2014 even though Harden finished with a triple-double , he only made 8 of 21 shots from the floor. It was just one game \u2014 one that Cleveland ultimately lost as the Rockets crushed them on the boards in the fourth quarter. At one point, Houston had a basketball power play \u2014 five consecutive possessions produced by four straight offensive rebounds. But the Cavs did find something that worked defensively, if just for a while, against a quality opponent. Right now, with Thompson out, that will have to do. \u201cThere were some great moments by our second-quarter lineup that kind of allowed us to stay home with their shooters,\u201d James said, while cautioning that the film would reveal mistakes, too. \u201cWe kept bodies on bodies. We was able to rebound when they missed, and we was able to get out and not only run, but execute as well. I think we can take something from it, but I\u2019m looking forward to watching the film as well.\u201d With the Boston Celtics chemically unable to lose at the moment , first place in the Eastern Conference could already be in danger of going bye-bye by the All-Star break. That didn\u2019t matter last season, of course, when the Cavs again ran roughshod through the East and made a third straight Finals appearance . But this is a new Cavs team, which hasn\u2019t been together for three seasons like that core group \u2014 one that featured James, as ever, but also had Kyrie Irving available to destroy defenses that had to give him space to operate. That may well happen again once Isaiah Thomas returns from his hip injury. But for now, with Thomas out and Derrick Rose again slowed by various injuries, Cleveland\u2019s not all there yet. The Cavs\u2019 rotation has been chaotic for a month. Rose has an ankle injury, which has left Shumpert to play point guard with the starters. (The Cavs don\u2019t believe that veteran Jose Calderon, signed in the summer, is an option to play big minutes against elite NBA point guards, per a team source.) Lue tried Wade with the starting lineup, but didn\u2019t like the flow \u2014 or J.R. Smith\u2019s displeasure with losing his starting job \u2014 and put Smith back in with the starters, with Wade coming off the bench . But bringing Wade off the bench as the backup point guard affected the flow of the reserve unit. \u201cIt\u2019s a different dynamic,\u201d James said last week. \u201cMy first year in Miami, we had to figure that thing out, too. At one point, we were 9-8 (but ultimately made The Finals \u2014 the first of seven straight Finals appearances and counting for James ). \u201cYou just figure it out. You watch film, you get better, you get on the floor, you compete. And you figure things out.\u201d But that Miami team\u2019s core group was much younger. James was 25 on opening night in 2010. Wade was 28. Chris Bosh was 26. Mario Chalmers was 24. By contrast, at an average age of 29.2 years per player, this year\u2019s Cavs\u2019 team is the oldest team in the league. James will be 33 in late December. Wade is 35. Smith is 32. Love and Rose are 29. Thomas is 28. Now, Crowder and Shumpert are just 27, and Thompson is just 26. But most of the new faces on this year\u2019s Cavs are, well, old faces \u2014 ones that aren\u2019t in shape yet, to boot. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure it out,\u201d said Crowder, one of many players trying to improve his cardiovascular condition \u2014 but while also mourning the death of his mother, Helen Thompson, in September . James also is working on his wind; he missed most of training camp dealing with a sprained left ankle , and he turned his ankle in the first quarter again in Houston, though he returned to the game. Almost everyone wanted a shorter preseason, but there were residual impacts \u2014 which may have impacted a veteran team like Cleveland\u2019s more acutely than others. \u201cThis was new,\u201d Wade said. \u201cNormally, the first game of the year is around Halloween or somewhere. You\u2019re seven games in by that time (this season). You could see, even though guys came to camp in good shape, it wasn\u2019t game shape, and the games happened real fast. It took a while. It definitely impacted it a little bit.\u201d In Love\u2019s case, the issue is more his frame. He remade his body when he came to Cleveland in 2014, knowing he\u2019d play a lot of stretch four rather than banging in the post as he did as the star on the Minnesota Timberwolves. But, now, the Cavs need him to bang in the post and protect the rim. Those are not among Love\u2019s more prodigious skills. \u201cIn some cases, you kind of have conserve energy, just \u2018cause you\u2019re so much a part of the offense and defense, both sides of the ball,\u201d Love said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just trying to find ways to get my body prepared for that. The four on this team is more perimeter oriented, a spacer \u2026 \u201cMore than anything, it\u2019s probably listening to my body. The thing is, it\u2019s early in the season, so I feel fresh. I don\u2019t know how in the next four to six weeks, how it will be. (Washington\u2019s Marcin) Gortat\u2019s a load, playing everybody\u2019s biggest guy, being in every pick and roll at the offensive and defensive end. We just have to see. I have to continue to get in better shape, lift \u2026 and making sure my mind is wrapped around playing center. Keeping that in my head that every night, I\u2019m going to be playing five.\u201d Thomas works up a major sweat in pregame shooting drills, and while a return doesn\u2019t appear imminent, he seems well on his way to return before the mid-January date the Cavs set before the season. He will have to do a lot of five-on-five work in practice before anyone, including him, feels comfortable with him returning to play. He\u2019s also been working on strengthening both his quads and hamstrings to help his hip when he gets back. \u201cI can see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Thomas said after his pre-game workout last week. When he comes back, the Cavs will dust off a lot of the sets they used to feature Irving alongside James. Defenses will no longer have the luxury of going underneath pick and rolls, as they do with Rose. The Cavs don\u2019t want to change Rose; he\u2019s a driver and finisher, not a spot-up shooter. But their offense is different when it\u2019s not spaced. James is used to probing the defense from up top, finding the weakness and getting the ball there. Almost always, it\u2019s someone shooting an open 3-pointer or dunking. Again, Cleveland will have to adjust on the fly. And in April, all of this may be a distant, funny memory as the Cavs once again start to steamroll the East in the playoffs. They still have the best player on earth, and he is still at the height of his playmaking and scoring powers (especially when teams like the Washington Wizards choose not to double him when he gets rolling, and he proceeds to drop 57 on their beans ). But, it seems clear \u2014 making an eighth straight Finals, with this older team, with an injured star uncertain of his future, with chemistry now just a word rather than a long-eanred reality in his locker room, and with Boston looming, desperate for revenge \u2013 this will be James\u2019 greatest feat ever. \u201cThings aren\u2019t always going to be as good as you would like them to be or figure it should be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you continue to work great habits and continue to get better at something you\u2019re not so good at at that point in time, with the talent, it will start to kick in, as long as you\u2019re working good habits.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Surprise teams dot East map | Your questions on Lonzo Ball & more | Q&A: Dennis Smith Jr. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

After the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 win in Dallas Saturday night , James tweaked Phil Jackson\u2019s selection of point guard Frank Ntilikina with the eighth pick in last June\u2019s Draft rather than Dennis Smith, Jr., the electric point from N.C. State who went to the Mavericks with the next selection. \u201cThe Knicks passed on a really good one,\u201d James said Saturday. \u201cDallas got the diamond in the rough. He should be a Knick. That\u2019s going to make some headlines, but he should be a Knick. But Dallas is definitely, I know they\u2019re excited that he didn\u2019t go there. He\u2019s an unbelievable talent.\u201d  James wasn\u2019t just blowing uninformed smoke; Smith was at James\u2019 summer skills camp years ago and the two have a relationship dating back to Smith\u2019s AAU days. And in a season where the woebegone Mavs are 2-11 \u2014 tied with Atlanta for the worst record in the league \u2014 the 19-year-old Smith is indeed the only diamond in the 2017-18 sack of coal in Big D. He hasn\u2019t been able to keep Dallas from losing, but he\u2019s holding his own in a Draft class full of promising points, including the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Lonzo Ball, the Sacramento Kings\u2019 De\u2019Aaron Fox and, yes, Ntilikina in New York. Coach Rick Carlisle and crew took Smith to play him; he\u2019s started every game he\u2019s played so far, getting thrown into the deep end. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to have failure, but it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Carlisle said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable for every great player. You\u2019re going to have some challenges out there. It\u2019s really important to be, I think, authentic in understanding the challenge on the one hand, and on the other, we\u2019ve got to have solutions to how he handles situations.\u201d There have been the predictable ups and downs: 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists against John Wall in an unlikely road win; 3 of 11 shooting in 29 minutes in a 30-point loss to the Warriors . But after years of searching for a long-term solution at the point, the Mavericks are certain they have their man \u2014 and Smith is ready to go through the morass of losing to get Dallas back where it had been for most of the last 15 seasons \u2014 a 50-win contender. Whatever Smith becomes in the NBA, though, he will not do it in New York. Me: What poster was above your bed when you were a kid? Dennis Smith, Jr.: I had a Chris Paul poster hanging up in my room. I just like how he played. He did everything. He did a little bit of everything. This is when he was on the Hornets. I think I was in fifth or sixth grade. He did everything when he was on the Hornets. They had a battle with the Spurs in the playoffs, and watching that, I wanted to be like that. I wanted to be at that level when I got older. I was a superfan. Me: I know that you knew already that Summer League was not the same as the regular season. But did anything drive that home for you? DSJ: You could say that. Even preseason was different. Summer League, it just seemed like it was way faster. Summer League seemed a lot faster than regular season games. It\u2019s more grind it out. You\u2019ve got to be locked in for longer periods. It\u2019s a difference. Me: How have you tried to separate the mental toll of the 82-game season from the physical? DSJ: Physically, I\u2019m doing a really good job right now. Our training staff, they make sure I stay on top of everything, whether I feel like it or not \u2014 make sure that I do it. It\u2019s greatly appreciated. Mentally, I think that just comes from having humbleness. I appreciate being able to play right now. I sat out a whole year already with my ACL. I\u2019m thankful for this opportunity. Me: It\u2019s funny that you mentioned that, because a lot of the scouts I spoke with before the Draft said one of the things they were most impressed with about you was you came back and played Adidas Nations \u2014 where you got injured \u2014 the next year. And I wonder how important it was for you to get back in time to play Nations? DSJ: I think that was one of the biggest things to help me conquer the injury mentally. For me, I was up early, moving, way before I was supposed to. I got in trouble for it a couple of times. I was moving around so much before I was supposed to my grandma hit me with a broom a couple of times when she caught me. For me to go back to Nations where I tore it at, that was a big mountain I had to climb mentally, and I think I conquered that. Me: What did that do for you? DSJ: It just let me know I\u2019m healthy, for certain. A lot of times I was doing things ahead of time. In my head I\u2019m saying I\u2019m healthy. Regardless of what they\u2019re saying, I can do whatever I feel is right. When I went out and did that, that just confirmed this for me. Me: I asked Coach this \u2014 and coaches want to win every night. But I asked him if it would be good for you to experience failure, so he can learn from it. Because that\u2019s what this league is. Everybody gets their butt kicked; the great ones come back from it. DSJ: Exactly. That\u2019s mental toughness. And I think part of being a rookie, especially being a point guard, I think it\u2019s important for me to take some of these lumps. I want to win every game, but tribulations come with being the best. That\u2019s with everybody. So you take your lumps early, but you\u2019ve got to look at everything as a lesson, and you\u2019ve got to grow from it. Me: What do you hope to have mastered by the end of this first season? DSJ: I would really say, even as a rookie, controlling the game, being able to control the tempo. That\u2019s learning my teammates, getting more in tune with my coach \u2014 which is going to happen, as much time as we\u2019ve been together, it\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s my main thing \u2014 wanting to be a really good leader and control the game. Me: What will that look like? DSJ: I think we\u2019ll win more games, for certain. We wouldn\u2019t be in this position we\u2019re in now. It\u2019s something that was relatively easy for me in college, high school and in college, but at the same time I had guys (my age). Now I\u2019m coming in with guys with families. It\u2019s different. I\u2019m 19; I\u2019m not even 20 yet. So it\u2019s an adjustment. But I\u2019m making it, though. I\u2019m earning their respect. I\u2019m coming in and doing what I\u2019m supposed to do, and I show them respect. It\u2019s going to take time, but I think I\u2019m going to get it. Me: How do you feel about your jumper right now? DSJ: I feel like it\u2019s good. I feel like I\u2019m shooting the ball well. There\u2019s always room for improvement, but I think I\u2019ve been pretty solid with it. It\u2019s respectable. Me: What have the vets like Dirk said to you about this season and making those adjustments to the NBA? DSJ: Just a learning process, basically. Stay positive through this whole thing. A lot of guys on our team, they\u2019re used to winning. The Mavericks are used to winning. Winning is all they\u2019ve done before. So they\u2019re saying stay positive and good things will happen\u2026(Nowitzki) is a guy that comes in and he\u2019s ready to do his work. Afterward he does his work. So he moreso leads by example. Wes (Matthews) is more vocal in his leadership, as well as HB. Everybody, they contribute in different ways. Me: You like the flow offense? DSJ: I like it. It\u2019s different for me, too. I\u2019m so used to penetrating, just like, I\u2019ve got the ball, go. Now it\u2019s like throw the ball, come get it back, things like that. It\u2019s an adjustment\u2026it\u2019s not easy right now, and it\u2019s not supposed to be, either. It wouldn\u2019t be worth having if it was. It\u2019s some adjustments to be made. Me: So when CP3 gets back, what do you anticipate it will be playing against him? DSJ: It\u2019s go time. It\u2019s go time. That\u2019s the only way to earn his respect, is to go out and compete. That\u2019s what I plan on doing. \u2014 Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert ( @rudygobert27 ), Saturday, 12:41 a.m., taking issue with Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters\u2019 claim that he was going for the ball when he collided with Gobert\u2019s knee in Friday\u2019s game. After the Tweet, the Jazz determined Gobert will be out 4-6 weeks with a bone bruise suffered on the play. \u201cLook, I iso-ed a little bit. Yeah, I iso a little bit. And that\u2019s not the way that Fred plays the game. And that\u2019s what I was saying, that it was either, \u2018we\u2019re going to build the team around me for a little bit and allow me to distribute the basketball, iso in pick and roll. Or you go with Fred \u2014 go up and down, shoot a lot of threes, that type of stuff. That spread type \u2014 kind of Golden State-esque, you know what I mean? They went that route, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, and that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s what I was saying.

From Basilio Reyes: Interesting comparison, Basilio. Most folks have indeed compared Ball to Kidd \u2014 a comparison Kidd apparently does not buy . And, I do think Kidd was more impactful defensively as a rookie that Ball has been, at least so far. I\u2019d say there were more expectations on Rubio as an offensive player when he came to the NBA in 2011 than as a defender, while everyone knew that Ball had some ways to go offensively to be a consistent contributor. But, let\u2019s look through each guy\u2019s first couple of weeks in the NBA: Name | Games Played\/Starts | PPG | APG | RPG | SPG | FG% | 3pt FG% | FT% Rubio | 13\/3 | 10.8 ppg | 8.3 apg | 4.4 rpg | 2.0 spg | 44.6% | 44.0% | 76.9 % Kidd | 13\/3 | 9.6 ppg | 6.0 apg | 6.2 rpg | 2.2 spg | 32.5% | 14.7% | 73.3% Ball | 13\/13 | 9.7 ppg | 7.4 apg | 6.8 rpg | 1.3 spg | 31.4% | 25.0% | 48.0% Other than rebounding, it certainly looks like Rubio did everything better at the start of his career than Ball has done. (And yet Ball became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple double in the Lakers\u2019 loss to the Bucks Saturday.) Ball\u2019s line does seem to dovetail much more with Kidd\u2019s during the same stretch of games \u2014 both are struggling terribly shooting the ball, especially from deep. Changing Administrations in D.C.? From Robert Huie: No, Robert, I don\u2019t. No serious critique of the Wizards would involve any discussion of the team being \u201cbetter\u201d without its four-time All-Star point guard. If you\u2019re saying Wall must make better decisions in close games and that the Wizards should run more plays for Beal in crunch time, I agree with you. Beal has become very good with the ball in his hands, and has earned more end-game looks; Wall has struggled to be consistent on isos and high ball screens late in games, when teams go under and keep him from getting to the basket. But if you\u2019re arguing the Wizards would be better overall without him, you\u2019re dead wrong. Washington is a near-elite team only because Wall is a near-elite player. His consistency at the defensive end is what keeps him from being a top 10 player. When he\u2019s locked in, engaged, doesn\u2019t gamble for steals and gets through screens, the Wizards can beat anybody. The opposite is true when he\u2019s indifferent at that end of the floor. Trying to make sense out of the senseless. From H.R. Bailey: Agree on 1 \u2014 we\u2019ve never adequately addressed mental health issues in this country, and certainly not since Vietnam\/Gulf Wars. Agree on 2 \u2014 Twitter, et.al., make us all feel on edge, with their constant democratization of argument without facts or context. A qualified agreement on 4 (while alcohol abuse remains a significant issue, drug use and abuse \u2014 of legal as well as illegal drugs \u2014 has eviscerated large swaths of the country; the opioid epidemic, like the crack epidemic a generation ago, has been devastating and our national addition to medication leaves us all slaves to Big Pharma). Agree to a degree on 5 (while it\u2019s true no law\/laws will eliminate mass shootings, the glut of automatic and semi-automatic weapons combined with swiss cheese regulations of same make access to such guns far too easy for far too many people who shouldn\u2019t have them). But no \u2014 hell, no \u2014 on 3. I am not sure about the \u201chistorians\u201d you\u2019ve read and cite here, but racism and misogyny have driven, and continue to drive every outcome when it comes to inequality in this nation, from employment to housing to business to criminal justice.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (33 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 12 apg, .418 FG, .848 FT): Playing as efficiently as he ever has in his career, not forcing shots and shrugging off the occasional bad shooting night. 2) LeBron James (27.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 6.7 apg, .534 FG, .762 FT): This is so disrespectful to your elders . 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (33.7 ppg, 12 rpg, 3.7 apg, .625 FG, .700 FT): Beat down the Spurs in San Antonio Friday, showing how devastating he and Eric Bledsoe could be together . 4) Kevin Durant (25 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 5 apg, .516 FG, 1.000 FT): Efficiency is off the charts as KD again starts an assault on the 190 Club (50 percent shooting, 40 percent on 3-pointers, 90 percent from the line). After returning from a thigh contusion to go for 29 points on 11 of 18 shooting, including 3 of 6 on 3-pointers and 4 of 4 free throws, KD\u2019s currently a little short of 190 status (.488\/.381\/.882). 5) DeMarcus Cousins (29 ppg, 14.3 rpg, 5.3 apg, .472 FG, .563 FT): You always start a revolution by indoctrinating the young first . Their loved ones will have no choice but to follow. 75 \u2014 Games over the last two NBA seasons for Joakim Noah, who played in his first game of this season on Sunday after missing the first 20 games of the season due to suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy. 32 \u2014 Years, by 2020, since Chicago last hosted an All-Star weekend . The city was awarded the 2020 game last week by the NBA , for the first time since 1988 \u2014 the year Michael Jordan won his, uh, controversial Slam Dunk title over Dominique Wilkins in front of the home crowd. Chicago will follow Los Angeles (2018) and Charlotte (2019). 17 \u2014 Coaches in NBA history with 700 or more career victories. Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle is four wins shy of joining that group. Per the league, Carlisle is tied with former Knicks coach Red Holzman for 18th on the all-time wins list with 696; after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Thunder, Carlisle is 696-532 (.567) in 16 seasons as a coach. 1) Sometimes, teams make the exact right move at the exact right time. Milwaukee getting Eric Bledsoe has that feel. Even though I thought Denver was more likely than the Bucks to get a deal done with Phoenix, I also said on 10 Before Tip a couple of weeks ago that Milwaukee would be a better fit for Bledsoe than the Nuggets. And, he is. Getting Giannis Antetokounmpo off the ball on occasion will keep him fresher and create much more havoc on the weak side. And Bledsoe\u2019s defensive abilities should only create more turnovers and runouts, and that\u2019s prime Bucks meat. 2) Pro Athletes: they\u2019re just like you and me! ( No, they aren\u2019t .) 3) Thursday night at 8 should provide you with a fairly good exhibition of professional basketball between the home team from Boston and the visiting team from the Bay Area of California, which has won two of the last three NBA championships. 4) The canine equivalent of \u201cjumped back \u2014 kissed myself\u201d . 1) In 2010, I was fortunate enough to cover Roy Halliday\u2019s playoff no-hitter with the Phillies \u2014 just the second such game in the history of Major League Baseball, after Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game for the Yankees \u2014 as part of Turner\u2019s baseball crew. I have never looked at the video of that game, because the moment was so grand and I felt so inadequate trying to live up to it, and to interviewing him afterward. He was such a great pitcher that day, and so many other days, mostly for Toronto and Philadelphia. And, by all accounts, he was a better teammate and person, singularly devoted to excellence at his craft. It was so devastating to hear of his death last week at age 40, while at the controls of his private plane. I can only hope that his family finds some level of comfort and peace in the difficult weeks and months ahead.  2) Utah has already had enough on- and off-court angst the last few months to last a lifetime. The last thing the Jazz needed was for Rudy Gobert to go down and miss significant time . But, he\u2019s out a month at least, and Quin Snyder will have to create new ways for his team to generate buckets and get stops in his absence. 3) The Clippers\u2019 good start will be a long-forgotten memory if they can\u2019t shore things up defensively: they gave up 117 points and allowed their opponents to shoot .529 overall (including 32-70 on threes: 45.7 percent) in losses last week to the Spurs, Thunder and Pelicans. 4) Time for a refresher: while I think this was an insane overreaction , the company involved did not violate this woman\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech.

It\u2019s so early in the season and there\u2019s so much that will reveal itself over the next five months. But there are some signs that there could be more quality on this side of the Mississippi this season than most thought. The preseason talk centered on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics as the favorites. The Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizards were getting nods in some circles as darkhorse contenders (with the Milwaukee Bucks close behind) and a young Philadelphia 76ers perhaps finally coming of age. And, allowing for injuries, those half-dozen teams have pretty much performed as scheduled and are in solid position in the conference race. But other players have come onto the scene in the first three weeks that few anticipated \u2014 and that\u2019s considering that bottom-feeding teams like the Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls are available throughout the season to pad win totals of their conference opponents. The Detroit Pistons are, improbably, 10-3 . The Orlando Magic are third in the conference, just behind Detroit, at 8-5 . The New York Knicks, who didn\u2019t win their seventh game last season until Nov. 22 , are 7-5 going into tonight\u2019s showdown with the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Indiana Pacers ( 6-8 ) and Brooklyn Nets ( 5-8 ) are under .500, but have been much more competitive than many thought they would be at any point in the season. The Magic has been transformed so far by much improved offense. After finishing 29th in the league in Offensive Rating last season , Orlando currently ranks eighth . Aaron Gordon is leading the league in 3-point percentage, making 55.3 percent of his shots behind the arc . That\u2019s not sustainable, but even a significant regression would leave Gordon well above his previous career best ( 29.6 percent in 2015-16 ). Philly\u2019s rise from doormat to tough out was anticipated if the 76ers could keep their young stars on the floor. And so far, both Joel Embiid and rookie Ben Simmons have been healthy, even as Philly continues to keep Embiid on a pitch count (he has yet to play more than 32 minutes in a game this season). That the Sixers have been so competitive without top overall pick Markelle Fultz is even more encouraging. But the Knicks came out of nowhere. There were no expectations in New York, after Phil Jackson was fired and Carmelo Anthony was traded just before the start of training camp . The only (unstated) goal was to be as bad as possible to get as high a pick as possible in the 2018 Draft. Yet New York has not only hung in there behind Kristaps Porzingis, who\u2019s put up historic numbers for the franchise in the first weeks of the season , but the Knicks have been entertaining most nights and competitive after a terrible first week of the regular season. Since starting out 0-3, they\u2019re 7-2. The Pistons, though, are the league\u2019s biggest surprise, a game and a half behind Boston for first in the east after completing a five-game homestand sweep with Sunday\u2019s win at Little Caesars Arena against the Miami Heat . And of all the East surprises, the Pistons look most poised to be able to keep it going all season. They\u2019ve posted quality back-to-back road wins over the LA Clippers and the defending-champion Golden State Warriors. Detroit has been strong at both ends, ranking sixth in Offensive Rating and 10th in Defensive Rating . Only the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets are also in the top 10 in both categories. Both Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson have improved significantly from subpar seasons last year, with Drummond inhaling rebounds at an astronomical rate of 15.7 per game. Avery Bradley has performed as advertised since coming to Detroit from Boston in the summer , while Langston Galloway and Ish Smith have been sensational defensively off the bench. Against Miami Sunday, first-round pick Luke Kennard had his best game, scoring nine of his 14 points coming in the fourth to hold the Heat at bay . Tobias Harris is fifth in the league in 3-point shooting ( 50.6 percent after making five 3-pointers Sunday ) and is averaging a career-high 20.1 points per game \u2014 more than former All-Stars Kevin Love, Paul Millsap and Al Horford. Harris is also 11th in the league in scoring among forwards , just behind Carmelo Anthony and Andrew Wiggins. Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy\u2019s motto to his team this year has been for each player to \u201cget into his greatness.\u201d Harris is finding his. He\u2019s flashed before in Milwaukee and Orlando, but thinks Van Gundy has unlocked the door for him this season. \u201cYou could tell through this offseason he took a lot of time figuring out where to get the guys to their best spots on the floor,\u201d Harris said Sunday night. \u201cHe sat down with everybody and told them what he needed, especially after last year \u2026 He broke down a lot of things to me. Getting threes up and being able to shoot them in rhythm, he showed me that that would open up the floor for (Drummond) and for me. Defensively he talked about being in different positions, and on offense, being able to go off the bounce.\u201d Harris helped himself as well by undergoing Lasik surgery in New York in August . \u201cMy cousin, Channing (Frye, the Cavs\u2019 big man) had it, and I called him and asked him, and he said it was the best thing he\u2019s ever done,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI sat down with the doctor. I told him what I was seeing on the court at times \u2014 a little bit of blurriness. I guess I had stigmatisms in my eyes and he said this could be beneficial to you. We decided to get it done. I was nervous. I probably called him and the lady about 10 times the night before to make sure they were ready. And then they did it, and then he said \u2018now you have to go and shoot lights out to make me look good.\u2019 \u201d Harris taped the operation, but he hasn\u2019t been able to make himself watch it yet. \u201cIt was kind of a weird procedure,\u201d he said. But things are much clearer on the court so far this season, for him and his teammates. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a huge difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confidence we have from understanding what needs to be done to win is there. When we play defense, when we\u2019re into teams, we see the impact that has. We have a lot of confidence, every day when we come into work. We\u2019re in the weight room and playing 80s old school music to get Coach to relax. We\u2019re playing Earth, Wind and Fire. The Gap Band. Michael Jackson. The coaches love it. We just want them to relax when they\u2019re here.\u201d Drummond and Van Gundy had vision troubles last season as well: they didn\u2019t see eye to eye. After giving Drummond a $128 million extension in the summer of 2016, the Pistons watched as Drummond\u2019s free throw problems ( bad enough to be parodied impersonator Brandon Armstrong ) and avoirdupois kept him from providing an offensive presence, even as Drummond continued to dominate the glass, leading the league in rebounding two straight seasons. His name came up in trade rumors. But Drummond came to camp in great shape, and he\u2019s remade himself at the foul line as well. After shooting 38.6 percent from the foul line last season, he\u2019s shooting 63.2 percent this year . That included two free throws with 1:28 left Friday against the Hawks that broke a 98-all tie and gave Detroit the lead for good. With Harris parked in the corner or weakside, and teams now having to stay home on him, there\u2019s all kinds of room for Drummond to roll to the rim in pick-and-roll sets. And Van Gundy is running offense through Drummond this season and he\u2019s responded by averaging a career-best 3.2 assists so far this season . \u201cHe knew he wasn\u2019t at his best (last season). He took the summer to evaluate that,\u201d Harris said of Drummond. \u201cCoach has put him in some positions to be a factor on offense. And on the boards he\u2019s playing to his strengths. Like I told him tonight, \u2018your energy fuels us.\u2019 And he got going in the third quarter (with five of his game-high 17 rebounds) and helped us win the game.\u201d We\u2019ll all get a truer idea of whether Detroit can keep this up over the next few weeks. The Pistons play nine of their next 11 on the road \u2014 including two games at Milwaukee, with singles at Minnesota, Oklahoma City, Boston, Washington, Philly and San Antonio. But Detroit looks poised to remain involved this year where it was disengaged far too often last season. \u201cWhen you have a season like we had, it puts it in perspective,\u201d Harris said. \u201cLast year we heard it: you guys are the guys that make it happen and we didn\u2019t make it happen. I tell everybody in the locker room, keep doing what we\u2019ve got to do and it will continue to grow.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Defensive funk marks season for Cavs | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Your questions on Lonzo Ball & more | Q&A: Dennis Smith Jr. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Cuban wound up with a win-win: He stood on principal for his most loyal fans, folks who routinely get displaced either from their usual seats or from the arena entirely when the league takes care of sponsors and VIPs attending the annual showcase. Yet he satisfied the NBA without leaving Mavericks fans on the outside in what proved to be an ice-storm weekend. The answer? The event was at Cowboys Stadium, the Taj Mahal of NFL stadiums operated by Jerry Jones and less than a year old at the time of the NBA\u2019s rental. An unprecedented and outrageous capacity crowd of 108,713 \u2013 accommodating Cuban\u2019s 10,000 season-ticket holders easily \u2013 dwarfed the 16,573 attendance from Reunion Arena in 1986, the event\u2019s previous stop in Dallas. The video screens alone at the retractable-roof behemoth are 160 feet wider, extending 33 feet beyond each end of a 94-foot regulation basketball court. By contrast, Chicago\u2019s NFL stadium, Soldier Field, is an open-air venue. Staging a basketball game in February, down at the Lake Michigan lakefront, is out of the question. Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf long disliked the area and had no interest in antagonizing his most devoted customers after the 1988 game held at old Chicago Stadium. That left the Chicago Bulls in the same bind as most other NBA markets. Do they decline the opportunity to host All-Star Weekend entirely, to make sure they don\u2019t annoy most of their customers? Or do they host the event, squeeze as many fans into the building as their share of tickets allows and hope the majority of Bulls fans enjoy secondary attractions or a TV view no different from the game being played in Los Angeles (2018) or Charlotte (2019)? \u201cIt\u2019s part of the issue for the home team,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver conceded Friday at United Center, where the league made it official that Chicago would serve as host city in 2020 after a 32-year gap. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in people from all over the world. We, of course, need those seats,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance. My sense for the season-ticket holders, many of them whom I\u2019ve talked to, I don\u2019t think their ultimate deal is, \u2018We\u2019d rather not have it all if we can\u2019t have our same seats.\u2019\u201d Adding and spreading events across multiple days and nights \u2013 from the rookie-sophomore game to All-Star Saturday competition (dunk, skill and 3-point contests), from All-Star practices to a celebrity exhibition \u2013 while offering the annual NBA Jam Session as an accessibly public backdrop is a way to accommodate a maximum number of attendees: Bulls faithful, NBA fans in Chicago and out-of-towners willing to brave likely frigid temperatures and possible snowstorms. There\u2019s the trend of the NBA christening new arenas with the big event too, and as Silver pointed out, United Center qualifies. Old Chicago Stadium still was in operation back in 1988, with the House Michael Jordan Built six years away. Michael Reinsdorf, the Bulls\u2019 president and chief operating officer, acknowledged the limitations the host team faces. Typically, teams conduct a lottery that pleases some, annoys many. \u201cWe have 22,000 seats here,\u201d the younger Reinsdorf said, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure we get a couple thousand seats. The NBA controls it all. \u2026 I don\u2019t really know whether it helps or hurts us from that perspective.\u201d But All-Star Weekend reminds the league, fans and worldwide viewers of Chicago\u2019s strength as an NBA market \u2013 something the Bulls still might not be demonstrating during its rebuild. It generally has a positive financial impact on the city and the neighborhood where it is held, factors that brought Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and Walter Burnett Jr., alderman of the 27th ward, to Friday\u2019s news conference. And it offers a goal for some Bulls players to participate in some capacity \u2013 say, Lauri Markkanen as a 3-point contestant or even All-Star and a 2018 or 2019 lottery pick in the Rising Stars game \u2013 on their home court, if not precisely in front of a home crowd. \u201cI look at this maybe as a way for us to use this as a little motivation,\u201d Bulls vice president of basketball operations John Paxson said, \u201cfor a few of our young kids we have really high hopes for.\u201d First, though, there came the challenge. Convincing the elder Reinsdorf to fund and tolerate this rebuilding plan, with those 22,000 voting with their wallets for 41 games each season, might have been easier than persuading him to stick a toe in All-Star waters. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Michael Reinsdorf said. \u201cI\u2019m serious, my son Joey and my daughter [Jenny]. Joey likes going to the games to watch the games. My daughter and other son [Harry] like to go to see who\u2019s at the games. \u2026 I tried to explain to my dad \u2013 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been to an All-Star Game since 1988 \u2013 the difference now than what it was like when we hosted it last.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It is the latest injury concern for the Celtics. Starting forward Al Horford sat for the second straight game with a concussion. Boston also lost Gordon Hayward for the season after a gruesome leg injury on opening night. Despite those absences, the Celtics rallied from an 18-point deficit to beat the Hornets 90-87 for their 11th victory in a row.

The 69th annual game will take place at the United Center, home of the six-time NBA champion Chicago Bulls, on Sunday, Feb. 16. This will mark the third NBA All-Star in Chicago, which held the annual celebration in 1973 and 1988. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made the announcement during a press conference at the United Center. He was joined by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Bulls President and Chief Operating Officer Michael Reinsdorf, Bulls Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations John Paxson, Alderman Walter Burnett Jr. (27th Ward) and Chicago Sports Commission Executive Director Kara Bachman. \u201cChicago is an iconic city with a storied basketball history. We are thrilled to bring the NBA All-Star Game back,\u201d said Silver. \u201cWe thank Mayor Emanuel, Jerry and Michael Reinsdorf and the entire Bulls organization and look forward to an exciting week of activities celebrating the game of basketball.\u201d Chicago will follow Los Angeles in 2018 and Charlotte in 2019 as All-Star host. NBA All-Star Game 2017 in New Orleans reached fans in 215 countries and territories in 49 languages. \u201cWe are honored that the NBA has selected Chicago to host All-Star 2020,\u201d said Michael Reinsdorf. \u201cBecause the game of basketball has such deep roots and a rich history in this city, with some of the most passionate sports fans in the country, we know it will be a successful event for everyone involved. Our expanded United Center campus and arena renovations with new restaurants and retail will provide visitors the opportunity to enjoy a fan-friendly environment.\u201d \u201cChicago is looking forward to hosting NBA All-Star 2020 and welcoming players and fans from across the country and around the world to our great city,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cChicago is a global hub for sports, entertainment and culture. Bringing the NBA All-Star Game back to the city for the first time in over three decades is a win for our city, our businesses and fans of all ages who will have the chance to be part of one of basketball\u2019s biggest events.\u201d In addition to the All-Star Game, the United Center will be the venue for the Rising Stars Challenge \u2013 an annual showcase for top rookies and second-year players \u2013 on Friday, Feb. 14, as well as State Farm All-Star Saturday Night, which features the Taco Bell Skills Challenge, the JBL Three-Point Contest and the Verizon Slam Dunk. In 2020, TNT will be televising the All-Star Game in prime time for the 18th consecutive year, marking Turner Sports\u2019 35th year of All-Star coverage.  The new Wintrust Arena, home of the WNBA\u2019s Chicago Sky starting next season, will host the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game and Rising Stars and All-Star Game practices. In partnership with the Chicago Sports Commission, the NBA will also hold several events for fans of all ages at venues throughout the city, including Navy Pier. These events will feature interactive programming that brings fans closer to NBA and WNBA players and legends. \u201cIt\u2019s a true privilege, as well as a testament to Chicago\u2019s great basketball history, to be selected to host NBA All-Star 2020,\u201d said Bachman. \u201cChicago\u2019s dedicated and experienced hoteliers will welcome the NBA and NBA fans in true Midwestern spirit.  NBA fans will have the opportunity to experience the renovated and expanded United Center campus, the brand-new Wintrust Arena and Chicago\u2019s landmark Navy Pier, which will host a variety of events for the local fans.\u201d During NBA All-Star 2020, the NBA will continue to celebrate its tradition and commitment to social responsibility with a full schedule of NBA Cares events. Through partnerships with schools, government and local nonprofit organizations in Chicago and surrounding areas, the league will reach thousands of children and families and provide important resources to community-based programs. NBA ALL-STAR HISTORY IN CHICAGO Chicago last hosted NBA All-Star in 1988, when the Bulls\u2019 Michael Jordan electrified his hometown crowd at Chicago Stadium. He outdueled the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Dominique Wilkins to win a spectacular Slam Dunk Contest, and the next day Jordan scored 40 points to earn MVP honors in the Eastern Conference\u2019s 138-133 victory over the Western Conference in the All-Star Game. The weekend also featured a third consecutive Three-Point Contest title for the Boston Celtics\u2019 Larry Bird, who famously raised a finger in the air in celebration before his final, competition-clinching shot dropped through the net.  During the Windy City\u2019s debut as NBA All-Star host, the East defeated the West 104-84 in the 1973 midseason classic at Chicago Stadium. Boston\u2019s Dave Cowens was named MVP after leading the East with 15 points and 13 rebounds. Los Angeles Lakers teammates Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West, who combined for 27 All-Star selections, each appeared in an All-Star Game for the last time."},{"id":48553,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-al-horford-questionable-vs-charlotte-hornets","date":"2017-11-10","title":"Al Horford (concussion protocol) to be held out tonight vs. Charlotte Hornets","content":"The Boston Celtics won\u2019t have their top big man back Friday night.

Atlanta led by 101-96 with 5 minutes 40 seconds left in the fourth quarter when Reggie Lewis, Kevin McHale and Bird scored consecutive baskets for a 102-101 Boston lead.

The Celtics fans in the crowd at Philips Arena were celebrating Kyrie Irving\u2019s best game in the green and white with that familiar chorus afforded to superstar players \u2014 \u201cM-V-P, M-V-P, M-V-P\u201d \u2014 when they show out on the big stage. Irving had better get used to such chants, because his first impression in his role as the new face of the franchise in Boston suggests that he\u2019ll hear it often this season. He has certainly played up to the chants through the Celtics\u2019 first 12 games \u2014 the first two losses and the subsequent 10 straight wins that have followed \u2014 leading to his move up the ranks in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. He\u2019s the best player on the best team in the league , always a reliable metric for MVP candidacy. And he\u2019s doing it by leading these Celtics in words and deeds, showing qualities he insists have always been there but were perhaps obscured from public view when he was playing alongside (and in the shadow of) LeBron James in Cleveland. * Kia MVP Ladder (Nov. 3):  Antetokounmpo makes early case \u201cSometimes he scares me because he says what\u2019s about to happen before it happens,\u201d said second-year forward Jaylen Brown. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the bench talking to him and he\u2019s like, \u2018we\u2019re going hit this shot\u2019 or \u2018coach is going to call a timeout\u2019 or whatever the case may be, and it happens. He\u2019s played so much basketball at a high level and he just knows the game inside and out. He\u2019s a great teacher.\u201d Irving\u2019s responsibility to lead this team, on and off the floor, changed dramatically five minutes and 15 seconds into that opener night loss in Cleveland when Gordon Hayward was lost for the season with a dislocated ankle . When he asked for a trade from Cleveland and landed in Boston , the narrative for his season shifted immediately. But Irving has not abandoned his desire to embrace each moment with his new team while maintaining a clear view of what lies ahead. There are no steps that can be skipped in the process for Boston. Every shot, every pass and every single moment along the way \u2014 no matter how insignificant it might seem \u2014 means something in the bigger picture for the Celtics. That\u2019s why nothing surprises or shocks Irving. Not the reaction of his team after Hayward\u2019s injury. And not after the way the Celtics have come together in the wake of that stunner or the wins that have piled up since then. \u201cIt\u2019s just a new season,\u201d Irving said after smoking the Hawks for a season-high 35 points. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just unexpected, more or less, because all of the input everyone had going into the season in terms of what they thought this was going to look like. The only thing that really matters is us handling our preparation and the trust that we continue to build in one another, the trust we have in this locker room, it\u2019s all reality based. We know what we want to accomplish. \u201cBut it starts with not taking any moment for granted. We\u2019ve got to better in practices and shootarounds and in every moment we have to connect, they matter. I always say, and Brad always says there are never really little things, in the grand scheme of things. Every moment matters for us to continue to build our foundation and what we want to be going forward.\u201d Irving is just 25 and seven seasons into a sensational career . He was the \u201cKid,\u201d per LeBron, in Cleveland. Not so in Boston, where he\u2019s a true elder statesman on a Celtics team where just four players \u2014 Al Horford (31), Aron Baynes (30), Marcus Morris (28) and Hayward (27) \u2014 are older. And he\u2019s universally regarded as one of the most dynamic shot-makers and shot-creators in the game, especially off the dribble and around the basket. \u201cHe\u2019s very unique,\u201d Horford said, \u201cso very unique. And he does it in so many different ways. He has a good sense of how teams are playing him, so if he\u2019s not finishing at the basket he\u2019s spraying the ball out [to open guys]. He has the ability to shoot 3s, I just think the more games he plays with our group the more comfortable he\u2019ll get and he\u2019s just going to get better, and that\u2019s the good thing for us.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s a great thing for these Celtics. None of them have been the places Irving\u2019s been, physically, mentally and emotionally, the past three seasons. Those are the places he\u2019s trying to lead them. You work until the final day of the NBA season in each of those Finals runs with the Cavaliers, where his clutch shooting and next level shotmaking helped end Cleveland\u2019s 52-year title drought two years ago, and it changes your perspective. It provides a gravity that only comes with experience. \u201cIt makes sense why he\u2019s Kyrie,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s a four-time All-Star, a NBA champion, a gold medalist, and all of the above. His talent level and scoring ability is off the charts. But the most surprising thing is he\u2019s a willing teacher. As good he is and as well he knows the game, he\u2019s able to teach and show you what he sees. And he\u2019s incredibly humble and a great dude to be around.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 4 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  29.5 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.4 assists His MVP case:  Harden was supposed to get a breather from this workload this season. But until Chris Paul can come back from his knee issues, the Rockets will need to see more and more of the Harden who has been on display early this season. All he\u2019s done is average 36 points, 10.6 assists and five rebounds in the Rockets\u2019 last five games. And that includes a 56-point, 13-assist performance (one point shy of the franchise single-game scoring record) in a win over Utah and his second triple-double of 2017-18 (35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists) in Thursday\u2019s win over LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Harden got some timely help from his friends during crunch time against the Cavs, namely Clint Capela and P.J. Tucker. The sort of help he\u2019ll get from Paul, however, is what Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni prepared Harden and his team for this season. He\u2019ll all have to settle for supernova Harden until Paul\u2019s return. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 8 Season stats:  22.0 points, 5.3 assists, 3.3 rebounds His MVP case:  No Hayward, no Horford, no problem for the Celtics\u2019 new resident superstar. Irving guided his crew to their 10th consecutive win (over the Los Angeles Lakers Wednesday in Boston) without his All-Star counterparts. It wasn\u2019t Irving\u2019s best shooting effort (7-for-21 from the floor, 0-for-7 from deep). But make no mistake, he was the steady hand the young Celtics needed to finish off yet another tightly contested game. Irving is blending in beautifully, sharing the ball and making plays for his young teammates, while maintaining his status as one of the league\u2019s great closers ( see his work in Atlanta Monday night ). His effort to make a seamless transition should not be overlooked, given all of the opportunities he\u2019s had to freelance and go off script early on this season. No one appreciates his leadership more than Celtics coach Brad Stevens and youngsters like Brown and Jayson Tatum. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 6 Season stats:  25.4 points, 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds His MVP case:  Any suggestion that Curry has taken a step or two back since Kevin Durant arrived are a bit overblown. He\u2019s not scoring at that wicked clip he did during the Warriors\u2019 73-win season and he might never get back to that level. But he\u2019s every bit as dangerous as he was a year ago, hitting his standards from last season through the Warriors\u2019 first 12 games. Curry and his fellow \u201cSplash Brother\u201d Klay Thompson remain the Warriors\u2019 sweet-shooting offensive security blanket when things are off (or when Durant is out of the lineup). Watching them combine for 50 points (22 from Curry to go along with eight assists and eight rebounds) in Wednesday\u2019s pounding of the Minnesota Timberwolves should serve as a reminder to the rest of the league of just how potent the Warriors can be without KD. With Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and the rejuvenated Philadelphia 76ers visiting Oracle Arena tonight, prepare for fireworks from the champs. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.9 points, 9.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists His MVP case:  Antetokounmpo had a monstrous night (40 points on 76 percent shooting) as the Bucks fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers, marking Milwaukee\u2019s fourth straight defeat. He\u2019s still leading the league in scoring and could pile up outlandish individual numbers forever. But he can\u2019t continue to do it alone. It\u2019s simply not a sustainable playoff model for the Bucks to continue to lean as heavily on him as they have. That\u2019s why the Bucks are hoping that new point guard Eric Bledsoe will have an immediate impact after coming over in that trade with Phoenix. A visit to San Antonio tonight will add an extra layer of spice for The Greek Freak and his new running mate. The Bucks would love for the two of them to find a rhythm quickly, as they\u2019ll have to ride the wave their new dynamic duo provides to get out of their current funk. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 15 Season stats:  30.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.3 blocks His MVP case:  You\u2019ve got to love the vibe Porzingis is fueling in and around the Knicks this season, his first as the true center of attention. He\u2019s the youngest player to average 30 points per game through his team\u2019s first 10 games of the season, passing up of all people a 22 year old Carmelo Anthony (who did it in Denver to kick off the 2006-07 season).The records, though, mean \u201cnothing\u201d to the Unicorn if they don\u2019t come with a playoff payoff in April. He\u2019s been a monster on both ends of the floor, scoring at an elite clip and rim protecting at an elite level. The only worry for Knicks fans is keeping Porzingis healthy and energized to keep playing at this high level. A sprained left ankle and contused right elbow kept him out of Wednesday\u2019s loss in Orlando. The Knicks need him back in action for Saturday\u2019s game against Sacramento at Madison Square Garden, where the surprising Knicks are 5-2 this season. The next five: 6. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 8. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 9. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers 10. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves And five more \u2026: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors; Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies, Aaron Gordon, Orlando Magic; Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers; Kemba Walker, Charlotte Hornets * * * An Inside Look at Nikola Jokic (from a Western Conference scout): \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping on my guy. I told you that last season and you didn\u2019t listen and here we are again! He\u2019s killing it, and you just don\u2019t want to listen. Like a lot of people, you\u2019re getting hung up on the fact that he\u2019s not yet a really consistent high-level scorer. And I get it, everybody in this league loves a guy that can go out and get you 22 to 26 points a night. We all want that guy. Jokic is still rounding out that part of his game. He\u2019s still working on polishing his offensive game. But when you have the ability to facilitate an offense through a guy that big, who can play out to the 3-point line and in, you allow his game to develop naturally instead of trying to force him into being something he\u2019s not \u2014 or better yet, something he\u2019s just not ready to be right now. \u201cHe\u2019s got it in him. He torched Brooklyn (for a career-high 41 points in a Nuggets win Tuesday), did it from all over the floor. Is he maybe doing a little more than I\u2019d like from distance? Yes. But having a guy who can score at every level, a guy who\u2019s capable, you don\u2019t try and manipulate his game. You allow him to continue to figure out his sweet spots while taking advantage of everything else he does for you on the floor. His vision is next level and he\u2019s as good a passer, as a big man, as there is in the game today. You forget he\u2019s just three years in, he\u2019s still so young. Once he puts it all together, you\u2019ll see more consistency from him in every phase. He\u2019s got the whole package, all of the skills needed to be in that (best big man in the game) conversation for years to come.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.
