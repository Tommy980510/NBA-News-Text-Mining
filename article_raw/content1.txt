March 22 | March 23 | March 24 Toronto is discussing potential deals for guard Kyle Lowry and forward Norman Powell, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . The 76ers and Heat are believed to be among the teams with interest, but it\u2019s unknown how far each would go to pull off a trade for either player. This season, Lowry is averaging 17.6 points and 7.4 assists, while Powell is averaging 19.5 points and 3 rebounds. Toronto has lost 9 straight and is in danger of falling out of the playoff chase in the East. \u2014 10:10 p.m. Victor Oladipo started 2020-21 with the Indiana Pacers, got dealt to the Houston Rockets in the James Harden mega-trade and, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , could be on the move again. The Miami Heat and New York Knicks are pursuing the former All-Star, but are hesitant to offer a \u201cpremium package\u201d for Oladipo, Wojnarowski reports. One thing that seems clear, however, is that Houston \u2014 per ESPN \u2014 will likely part with Oladipo before March 25. This season, Oladipo is averaging 21.2 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 5.0 apg and 1.2 spg with Houston and turned down a reported two-year extension with the Rockets back in late February. \u2014 1:42 p.m. As mentioned below, the Indiana Pacers would need a lot of incentive to part with center\/forward Myles Turner. That may not be the case with starting point guard Malcolm Brogdon, writes Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports . He reports the Pacers could be willing to part with Brogdon as they feel Caris LeVert can handle the point guard duties. The LA Clippers could be a potential suitor for Brogdon, per Yahoo Sports. Additionally, Indiana could be willing to move Aaron Holiday, too. \u2014 12:22 p.m. Former All-Star big men Andre Drummond and LaMarcus Aldridge are technically still members of the Cavs and Spurs, respectively. However, neither has played in weeks as their teams try to find new landing places for them. Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report reports that the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks and Chicago Bulls have shown interest in Drummond, while the Celtics and Miami Heat are interested in Aldridge. However, the hefty contracts both players sport continue to make them perhaps more likely to be bought out (and sign wherever they wish) than traded on or before March 25. \u2014 11:12 a.m. In terms of total blocks and blocks per game, no one in the NBA this season is better than the Indiana Pacers\u2019 Myles Turner. The center\/forward is enjoying one of his best overall seasons (13.2 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.4 bpg) and has Indiana in the mix for \u2014 at worst \u2014 a shot in the Play-In Tournament. J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star reports while the list of suitors for Turner is lengthy, Indiana would need to get a \u201cno-brainer\u201d trade scenario to part with him. Among the teams interested in Turner, per Michael, are the Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers and New York Knicks. UPDATE:  Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports reports the Portland Trail Blazers are showing interest in McGee, but are in a tricky spot in getting him since regular starter Jusuf Nurkic should be on the way back soon. \u2014 12:19 p.m. Before the 2020-21 season began, the Los Angeles Lakers traded veteran big man JaVale McGee to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a small deal that few may have noticed. Yet McGee has been better than expected with the Cavs, averaging 8 ppg and 5.2 rpg and 1.2 bpg in mostly reserve minutes while carving out a solid role in the rotation. It is not likely he will be bought out, which means he will either be with the team going forward or be traded, writes Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com . The Cavs are happy with what McGee has brought to the team on a variety of fronts \u2014 playing time, mentoring and more \u2014 and are reportedly hesitant to move him. \u2014 8:15 a.m. UPDATE: The Magic, per Yahoo Sports\u2019 Vincent Goodwill , are seeking a first-rounder and a young asset in return for Aaron Gordon. The Minnesota Timberwolves are interested in Gordon, but the Magic aren\u2019t high on the Wolves\u2019 offering of Jarrett Culver. \u2014 12:21 p.m. Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon has reportedly asked to be traded from there and it appears the Boston Celtics may be the current leaders to land him. Matt Moore of The Action Network reports several teams \u2014 including the Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers are in pursuit of Gordon. The Celtics have reportedly offered two first-round picks for Gordon, and the trade might also include swingman Evan Fournier moving to Boston as well. However, as with most things at this stage, these are mostly trade talks and all aspects of that remain quite fluid. \u2014 8 a.m. The Memphis Grizzlies have some of the most intriguing frontcourt talent in the NBA with the likes on Jaren Jackson Jr., Justise Winslow, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson and Brandon Clarke in that mix. However, they also have a potential trade chip in that mix in veteran center Gorgui Dieng, who is on the last year of his contract. Evan Barnes of The Commercial Appeal reports it seems more likely that the Grizzlies will buy out Dieng than trade him, but his situation bears watching over the next few days. In addition, Barnes reports the Grizzlies are highly unlikely to trade a rotation player, especially considering all the injury woes Memphis has dealt with this season. \u2014 7:58 a.m."},{"id":515100,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-nba-trade-deadline-buzz-march-22-edition","date":"2021-03-23","title":"2021 NBA trade deadline buzz: March 22 edition","content":"As we close in on the official trade deadline ( March 25, 3 p.m. ET ), k eep up with the latest rumblings around the NBA \u2014 and the latest deals that have been agreed to \u2014 as deadline day approaches.  March 22 | March 23 The midseason race to take advantage of a seemingly wide-open Western Conference begins with a tentative first step. The Clippers have agreed to deal Mfiondu Kabengele, a future second-round pick, and cash considerations to Sacramento in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. The move creates an open roster spot for the Clippers and gives them extra space under the hard cap that could be useful should they acquire another player before this week\u2019s deadline. The trade is made possible via Sacramento\u2019s trade exception. In Kabengele, the Kings would acquire a 23-year-old big man that was drafted 27th overall in 2019. In 23 appearances this season, the former Florida State standout has put up 27 points and 14 rebounds over 94 total minutes. \u2014 11:59 p.m. The Miami Heat are expected to be busy this week. In addition to reported interest in Raptors guard Kyle Lowery, the defending Eastern Conference champions reportedly are the \u201cmost likely landing spot\u201d for Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge, according to a report from Marc Stein of the New York Times . Aldridge and the Spurs mutually agreed to part ways on March 11 . \u2014 5:50 p.m. The Sacramento Kings and former No. 2 overall pick Marvin Bagley III have had some ups and downs together and trade chatter has followed the promising big man at times in his career. Per Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes , the Detroit Pistons recently turned down an offer of Bagley III for promising rookie Saddiq Bey. Bagley is averaging 13.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and shooting 50.2% but has struggled with injuries all season. He recently was ruled out for four weeks with a broken hand. Bey, the No. 19 pick in last year\u2019s Draft, is averaging 10.5 ppg, 4.1 rpg and shooting 40.4% for the struggling Pistons. \u2014 3:35 p.m. Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon has apparently asked to be moved from the only NBA team he has ever known, per Jared Weiss and Sam Amick of The Athletic . The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2014 draft is averaging 14.7 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game for the Magic this season, but has been hampered by injuries in 2020-21. Josh Robbins and Kelly Iko of The Athletic report the Houston Rockets have shown interest in acquiring Gordon. Overall, Gordon has played in 426 career NBA games, all of them with the Magic, and he ranks in the franchise\u2019s top 10 in rebounds, blocks and games played. \u2014 10:29 a.m. In acquiring Andre Iguodala from the Memphis Grizzlies last season, the Miami Heat also received a $7.5 million trade exception that expires at 11:59 p.m. today. (For a look at what trade exceptions are and why they matter, check out this page .) Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald points out that one player the Heat could eye with that exception is Sacramento Kings swingman Nemanja Bjelica. However, in trading for Trevor Ariza last week (as a part of jettisoning Meyers Leonard), Miami went from being roughly $8 milion away from the luxury-tax line to $5.4 million.went from being about $8 million away from the luxury-tax threshold to about $5.4 million below the luxury-tax line. \u2014 9:33 a.m. The Chicago Bulls are No. 10 in the Eastern Conference, which puts them in the mix for the Play-In Tournament and a shot at the team\u2019s first playoff berth since 2017. However, Chicago may be looking to upgrade its point guard situation for the stretch run, writes Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times , and talks of potential trades involving backup guard Tomas Satoransky have been floated about. There is also talk of the Bulls being interested in New Orleans Pelicans guard Lonzo Ball, but most of that has been of the rumor variety.

That\u2019s where his career, his legend and his influence was \u2014 elevated, hanging, floating, above all others who strained their necks to observe this unusual pioneer, and also to get a good look at the bottom of his sneakers. Elgin Baylor , in a sense, was beyond the reach of many who made a living in basketball and even those who achieved the highest honor and made the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Actually, it\u2019s surprising that inside that sacred shrine, nobody got the great idea to hang his plaque a few inches higher than anyone else\u2019s. If you see the game today (rapid pace, filled with jumpers), Baylor\u2019s impact is everywhere, decades after he retired. The showmanship, the improvisation, the double-clutch \u2014 heck, the jump shot \u2013 was either introduced by Baylor or perfected by Baylor. He personified the essence of a trailblazer in a game that he helped shape. The high-flying succession of atmospheric greatness was: Baylor, then Connie Hawkins, then Julius Erving, then Michael Jordan, then everyone else. That\u2019s why his loss today is massive. Baylor died Monday at age 86 in Los Angeles, where he starred for the Lakers, and later with the Clippers became one of the first Black men to lead a team as a general manager. In fact, Baylor helped bring professional basketball to L.A. and saved basketball in the city. As a member of the franchise when it was located in Minneapolis, Baylor was the main attraction on a team that began to flounder after initial success during the George Mikan era before eventually moving to Los Angeles. The Lakers had to sign the acrobatic 6-foot-5 forward after drafting him. Bob Short, the team owner, told the Los Angeles Times : \u201cIf he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.\u201d In the big city, basketball was somewhat of a novelty \u2014 strange, given how the Lakers are massively embraced and have come to symbolize glitz and championships \u2014 but true. The Lakers didn\u2019t have a strong foothold during the early years, yet Baylor, helped by his Hall of Fame teammate and great friend Jerry West, changed all of that. In an interview a few years ago, while discussing Baylor, West bemoaned that Baylor was lost on the current generation. West was fiercely protective of Baylor mainly because Baylor had an easy personality. He connected with West quickly once they became a twosome and never begrudged the league\u2019s eventual \u201clogo\u201d for getting far more attention in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you never saw him play,\u201d West said, \u201cit was really your loss for being born too late. He was a magnificent player and everything you could imagine as a friend and a teammate.\u201d West teased Baylor and nicknamed him \u201cTweety Bird\u201d because his voice turned high-pitched when he yelled. The two friends shared almost everything in common except skin color. Baylor took pressure off West in games, and vice versa. They shared dinners on the road, spent time with each other\u2019s families, and grew up as stars together, and of course remained with the same team for over a decade. Even in retirement, the two socialized often, since they both lived in L.A. Baylor\u2019s style was unique for the time in which he played. It was groomed on the asphalt playgrounds of Washington D.C., where Baylor excelled in a game that at that time began to gain the affections of Black kids in the city. Also, basketball in the early 1950s wasn\u2019t too far removed from the set-shot days. Baylor changed all of that. With many college basketball programs still segregated, especially in the South, Baylor made his way to the West Coast, with mostly white teammates and in a mainly white region and before mostly white fans. While he wasn\u2019t the first Black player on that level, he was one of the first black superstars, along with Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, centers who unlike Baylor played close to the rim. Baylor\u2019s reputation began to soar, much like his style, not long after he entered college; the Minneapolis Lakers chose him in the 14th round in 1956, but Baylor chose to continue his college career. He was an instant NBA sensation, earning Rookie of the Year honors after averaging 24.9 points and 15.0 rebounds, and his career took off. Baylor\u2019s career average is 27.4 ppg and 13.5 rpg, numbers that really don\u2019t do justice to the impact he left behind. The 6-foot-5 forward was one of a handful of players who were not only good, but highly entertaining. His signature shot was the bank shot \u2014 until then, the only time players used the glass was for layups. Baylor used his dribble to set up his shot, which was almost impossible to block. He also used the then-unknown technique of \u201changing,\u201d where he would elevate, wait until his defender would return to the ground, then release the shot. He had plenty of iconic moments in games, but even among those a few stand out: In 1960, Baylor torched the Knicks for an NBA record 71 points \u2026 before the 3-point line. In the 1962 NBA Finals against the Celtics, Baylor scored 61 points. During that 1961-62 season, Baylor served duty with the National Army Reserve and his practice time with the team was cut almost in half. No matter; Baylor averaged 38.3 ppg and 18.6 rpg in 48 games. Baylor was snake-bit, though, in terms of championships. He had the misfortune of starring during the Celtics dynasty of the 1960s; he and the Lakers never could manage a breakthrough. And then, during the 1971-72 season, Baylor\u2019s body was beaten and his knees were worn down from years of jumping. He retired nine games into that season \u2014 and the Lakers ultimately set records for consecutive wins, total wins for a season, and won the championship a few months later. Baylor was eventually placed in charge of the LA Clippers, who were questionably run by Donald Sterling. Baylor later sued him for employment discrimination after being dismissed. Despite those issues, Baylor earned Executive of the Year honors in 2006 after assembling a Clippers team that won its first playoff series since 1976 \u2014 when they were the Buffalo Braves. \u201cI always had great respect for Elgin\u2019s basketball mind, how he handled himself and how he dealt with people,\u201d West said. In some ways, Baylor, despite his greatness and legend, was overlooked. Besides the untimely retirement and poor luck of having his prime during the Russell-era Celtics, Baylor was among the last to get a statue in front of Staples Center. That didn\u2019t happen until 2018. Besides the glorification of West, there was Oscar Robertson along with Wilt and Russell to contend with in terms of respect. Baylor never seemed bothered by that at the time, at least outwardly, although later in life he did acknowledge he felt forgotten at times in terms of his accomplishments. In a statement released by the Clippers, where West is a consultant, West said he \u201cloved him like a brother\u201d and added: \u201cI\u2019m saddened beyond belief that he is gone. I will forever cherish my days spent with him as a teammate. He was one of the most gifted and special players this game will ever see and he has never gotten his just due for what he accomplished on the court. My first few years in the league, he cared for me like a father would a son. He nurtured me and encouraged me like no one else had during that period of my life. We shared the joy of winning and the heartbreaking losses during the Finals. He was a prince both on and off of the court. There are no words to describe how I feel at this time.\u201d West urged the Lakers to recognize Baylor when the organization began to turn its immortals into bronzed statues at Staples Center. But Baylor\u2019s turn didn\u2019t happen until after the legacies of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, West, Chick Hearn, and even Shaquille O\u2019Neal were already cemented in stone. During the statue ceremony for Baylor that came too late for many \u2014 but better late than never \u2014 West once again backed his friend with emotional and heartfelt words: \u201cThere\u2019s no greater admiration for any person that I\u2019ve known than Elgin Baylor. I\u2019ve laughed with him, been to the depths of the ocean with him, I\u2019ve loved him like a brother, and I still do today. This is one of the greatest men I\u2019ve ever met in my life. He was the most unique player in the game. He was ahead of his time. There are a lot of wonderful players who\u2019ve played this game, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been anyone who combined his incredible play with the kind of person he was. He never changed.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

Boston, however, has struggled to build consistency around the pair of promising swingmen. The Celtics have not been more than three games above .500 since January. Injuries to Kemba Walker and Marcus Smart, as well as a bout with COVID-19 for Tatum, have limited the team\u2019s ability to rebound.

In Week 13, 18 teams will play four games, while the rest will play three. A whopping 22 teams (BOS, BKN, CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, GSW, HOU, LAC, LAL, MEM, MIA, MIL, MIN, NOP, NOP, ORL, PHX, POR, SAC, SAS, and UTA) will play a back-to-back set. Kelly Olynyk (PF\/C \u2013 MIA): 48% rostered Over the past seven games, Olynyk has played over 30 minutes in six. He has been a top-20 player over that span! The rebounds and three-pointers are a staple of the Olynyk menu, but it\u2019s been his contributions on the defensive end that has really been eye-opening. He has averaged two steals and 1.2 blocks per game. He even chips in some assists. Now, he is inconsistent and has put up plenty of duds this season, but he should be more than serviceable as long as he gets over 30 minutes per game. Saddiq Bey (SF \u2013 DET): 37% rostered Over the last two games, Bey has produced 20 points, two three-pointers, six rebounds, two assists, and two steals in one game and 28 points, six three-pointers, 12 rebounds, two assists, and two steals in the other. He has played 32 and 39 minutes, respectively. The rookie could be settled in and ready to be a consistent contributor. He did become a regular starter just 15 games ago. With that said, before his recent two-game heater, he did go for seven points, two rebounds, and one steal, so there will likely be inconsistencies. However, he makes up for it with his average minutes and his decent usage rate. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (SG \u2013 HOU): 24% rostered Over the last six games, Tate has averaged 30.1 minutes, 11.8 points, 0.8 three-pointers, five rebounds, two assists, 2.5 steals, and 0.5 blocks. The points won\u2019t be voluminous, but he did go for 25 points three games ago. Tate\u2019s value comes from the across-the-board production he delivers. His last game against Detroit is the perfect example, as he scored 12 points, grabbed three rebounds, dished out three assists, notched four steals, and blocked one shot while shooting 62% from the field. On the season, he has converted 51% of his shot attempts. Moses Brown (C \u2013 OKC): 33% rostered The Thunder only play three games this week with no back-to-backs, so the playing time and production may not be there this week. This is more of a stash to see what happens at the trade deadline, as Al Horford has been a potential trade candidate since arriving in Oklahoma City. The team is likely going to develop their youth down the stretch. Moses has started two of the last three games. In those starts, he went for 20 points, 16 rebounds, and five blocks in one game and for 13 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal, and one block in the other. He played 30 and 24 minutes, respectively. Now, it\u2019s within the range of outcomes that Horford doesn\u2019t get traded. In that scenario, Brown isn\u2019t completely useless, as he played 24 minutes in the last game with Horford and would likely start when the team sits him on back-to-backs. Danny Green (SG\/SF \u2013 PHI): 32% rostered Green\u2019s rostership increased by nine percentage points since last week. Yipee! I usually feel gross when writing up Green, but he has been a top-50 player over the last 13 games. Like Jae\u2019Sean Tate, the points won\u2019t be voluminous, but he has been contributing in every category: 10 points, 2.8 three-pointers, 3.8 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.8 steals, and one block over the last 13 games. However, his field goal percentage stinks, though, as he has gone 39% from the field. At least he doesn\u2019t turn the ball over. Jordan Poole (PG\/SG \u2013 GSW): 33% rostered Poole started the last two games due to Steph Curry\u2019s injury, and he played 38 and 34 minutes. He went for 26 points, three three-pointers, four rebounds, five assists, and one steal in one game and for 25 points, three three-pointers, two rebounds, two assists, and one steal in the other. Curry shouldn\u2019t be out long, so Poole\u2019s minutes will obviously go down, but he was playing in the low-20s with Curry. He scored double digits in all five of those games with a high of 26 points. The usage rate was in the mid-20s. He looks to be the microwave off the bench for the Warriors. Matisse Thybulle (SG\/SF \u2013 PHI): 13% rostered Need defensive production? Then you\u2019ve come to the right place. Thybulle has notched a steal and block in five straight games. He has gone on a three-game stretch with three, three, and five steals. He\u2019s a sub-10 usage player, so don\u2019t expect many points or assists, but he will chip in some three-pointers and rebounds. Josh Hart (SG\/SF \u2013 NO): 33% rostered Hart\u2019s main value comes from rebounds, as he averages 7.4 of them per game. He will chip in three-pointers and will occasionally pop off with double-digit points, but he is all about the rebounds (and will get you some steals). Dwight Howard (C \u2013 PHI): 44% rostered With Joel Embiid out for a while, Howard is going to be a viable fantasy player. While he doesn\u2019t start, he\u2019s played 21, 30, and 28 minutes the last three games. He has double-doubled with points and rebounds in each game, and he logged zero, one, and three blocks. He should provide you with blocks and rebounds consistently. Tomas Satoransky (PG\/SG \u2013 CHI): 18% rostered Satoransky has started the last four games and has averaged 30.3 minutes per game. He won\u2019t score many points, but he will contribute those precious assists while chipping in some three-pointers and rebounds. He\u2019s been a top-100 player over the last four games, and it looks like Billy Donovan will continue starting him at point guard because he fits better alongside Zach LaVine than Coby White."},{"id":517014,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-league-pass-games-to-watch-week-14","date":"2021-03-22","title":"NBA League Pass Games to Watch: Week 14","content":"Note: All stats and records through games played on Sunday, March 21 .

The Hawks have been better on both sides of the ball during the win streak \u2013 their offensive rating of 116.4 ranks sixth in the league in March, while their defensive rating of 105.0 ranks second. Prior to the streak, the Hawks ranked 11th in offense (112.7) and 23rd in defense (112.9). The Hawks won the first meeting with the Clippers, 108-99 on Jan. 26 , behind 38 points from Trae Young, but LA did not have either Kawhi Leonard or Paul George in the lineup. Tuesday, March 23 Phoenix (28-13) at Miami (22-21)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Suns and Heat are two teams that have experienced massive turnarounds this season. After starting the season 8-8, the Suns are an NBA-best 20-5 since Jan. 28 as they have climbed to second place in the West, just two games back of Utah. The Heat opened the season 7-14 through Feb. 3. Since then, they have gone 15-7 to climb to fifth in the East despite dropping their last three games. Chris Paul just became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career assists and is in pursuit of Magic Johnson for fifth place. He needs 138 assists to reach the top five all-time, which would take him 16 games based on his current average (8.8 apg). Wednesday, March 24 Memphis (19-20) at Oklahoma City (18-24)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Grizzlies and Thunder have split their first two meetings of the season. In their last game on March 14, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored a game-high 30 points to lead OKC to a 128-122 win. But as always, you never know when Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant will strike with a ridiculous highlight like the one below. These two young stars are worthy of League Pass Alert status just about every time they step on the court. SGA leads the NBA in drives per game (25.2), while Morant ranks third (19.4) and both players rank in the top five points points and assists off drives this season. Friday, March 26 Denver (25-17) at New Orleans (18-24)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Zion Williamson enters Week 14 riding an incredible streak as he has scored at least 20 points on at least 50% shooting in 20 consecutive games . Since the 1983-84 season, only two other players have put together such a streak \u2013 Karl Malone with 20 games spanning two seasons (April 4-Dec. 1, 1989) and Shaquille O\u2019Neal with 25 games two decades ago (Jan. 7-March 15, 2001). Can Zion surpass Shaq\u2019s mark? If he can keep it going against the Lakers on Tuesday, Zion will face a Nuggets team that he scored 30 points on 69.2% shooting in the first meeting on March 21. Saturday, March 27 New York (21-22) at Milwaukee (27-14)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Bucks enter Week 14 riding a six-game win streak \u2013 the second-longest active streak in the league \u2013 as Milwaukee climbed within two games of top-seeded Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Knicks are in a race of their own as they currently occupy the No. 7 seed, which would put them in the Play-In Tournament, and are trying to climb into the top six for a guaranteed playoff berth, which would snap a seven-year postseason drought . The Bucks and Knicks have split their first two meetings \u2013 each winning by 20 points or more. Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging 25.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and 7.5 assists on 63% shooting against the Knicks, while fellow All-Star Julius Randle is averaging 18 points, 11 rebounds and 6.5 assists against the Bucks. Giannis is set to miss Monday\u2019s game with a sprained knee, but hopefully he is back in the lineup by Saturday."},{"id":517013,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nikola-jokic-giannis-antetokounmpo-potw-week-13","date":"2021-03-22","title":"Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo named NBA Players of the Week","content":"Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo have been named the NBA Players of the Week for Week 13.

He was 86. The Lakers announced that Baylor died of natural causes in Los Angeles with his wife, Elaine, and daughter Krystal by his side. \u201cElgin was the love of my life and my best friend,\u201d Elaine Baylor said in a statement released by the Lakers. \u201cAnd like everyone else, I was in awe of his immense courage, dignity and the time he gave to all fans. At this time we ask that I and our family be allowed to mourn his passing in privacy.\u201d With a silky-smooth jumper and fluid athleticism, Baylor played a major role in revolutionizing basketball from a ground-bound sport into an aerial show. He spent parts of 14 seasons with the Lakers in Minneapolis and Los Angeles during his Hall of Fame career, teaming with Jerry West throughout the \u201960s in one of the most potent tandems in basketball history. Baylor had an uncanny ability to hang in mid-air indefinitely, inventing shots along the way with his head bobbing. Years before Julius Erving and Michael Jordan became international superstars with their similarly acrobatic games, Baylor created the blueprint for the modern superstar. \u201cElgin Baylor set the course for the modern NBA as one of the league\u2019s first superstar players,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement . \u201d An 11-time All-Star during his Hall of Fame career with the Lakers, Elgin produced remarkable results with his athleticism and groundbreaking style of play, including setting an NBA Finals record with 61 points in Game 5 of the 1962 championship series \u2013 a performance made all the more extraordinary by the fact that he had spent part of that season away from his team while on active duty in the Army. \u201cIn addition to his legendary playing career, Elgin was a man of principle. He was a leading activist during the height of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s and an influential voice among his fellow players. After his retirement, Elgin remained a part of the NBA family as both a coach and an executive, imparting his wisdom to generations of NBA talent. Elgin will be deeply missed, and we send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Elaine, his family and friends.\u201d Born on Sept. 16, 1934, in Washington, D.C., Baylor played one season at the College of Idaho before transferring to Seattle University, where he led the team to their first NCAA championship game before being drafted first overall by the Minneapolis Lakers in 1958. Baylor averaged 24.9 points, 15.0 rebounds and 4.1 assists as a rookie en route to Rookie of the Year honors. Baylor would go on to play 14 seasons for the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers, earning NBA All-Star honors 11 times with 10 First Team All-NBA appearances. After retiring from basketball in 1971, Baylor went on to serve as a coach for the New Orleans Jazz and Vice President of Basketball Operations for the LA Clippers. The 6-foot-5 Baylor played in an era before significant television coverage of basketball, and little of his play was ever captured on film. His spectacular style is best remembered by those who saw it in person \u2014 including West, who once called him \u201cone of the most spectacular shooters the world has ever seen.\u201d From 1960-61 through 1962-63 he averaged 34.8, 38.3, and 34.0 points, respectively. He led the Lakers to the NBA Finals eight times, was a 10-time All-NBA First Team selection, and played in 11 NBA All-Star Games. At one time Baylor owned records for most points in a game, in a playoff game, and in one half of a playoff game. In 1962-63, he became the first NBA player to finish in the top five in four different statistical categories \u2014 scoring, rebounding, assists, and free-throw percentage. Because his career paralleled the succession of juggernaut Boston Celtics teams in the 1950s and 1960s, Baylor never played on a club that won an NBA Championship. His best years as a scorer coincided with Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s peak years, and Baylor never captured a scoring title. Baylor became the first NBA player to surpass 70 points with a 71-point game Dec. 11, 1960, against New York. Chamberlain set the record of 100 points in 1962. \u201cElgin was THE superstar of his era \u2013 his many accolades speak to that,\u201d said Lakers Governor Jeanie Buss said in a statement released by the Lakers. \u201cHe was one of the few Lakers players whose career spanned from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. But more importantly he was a man of great integrity, even serving his country as a U.S. Army reservist, often playing for the Lakers only during his weekend pass. \u201cHe is one of the all-time Lakers greats with his No. 22 jersey retired in the rafters and his statue standing guard in front of STAPLES Center. He will always be part of the Lakers legacy. On behalf of the entire Lakers family, I\u2019d like to send my thoughts, prayers and condolences to Elaine and the Baylor family.\u201d As a rookie in 1958-59 Baylor was sensational. He finished fourth in the league in scoring (24.9 ppg), third in rebounding (15.0 rpg), and eighth in assists (4.1 apg). He registered 55 points in a single game, at the time the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks\u2019s 63 and Mikan\u2019s 61. In 1961-62, Baylor hit his stride along with West, the Lakers\u2019 hotshot second-year guard. Unfortunately, Baylor was playing at a time when eligible males were required to perform military service, and his season was curtailed. He spent half of the year stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington, playing only when he could obtain a weekend pass. He appeared in 48 games that season. Still, with Baylor (38.3 ppg) and West (30.8 ppg) combining for almost 70 points per game, the Lakers won the Western Division by 11 games and advanced to the NBA Finals. In what would become a familiar matchup, the Lakers played the Celtics for the championship \u2014 and lost. Boston won Game 7 in overtime, 110-107, to claim a fourth consecutive title. Baylor was phenomenal in the playoffs. He scored 61 points in Game 5 of the title series, setting a single-game playoff record that would stand for 24 years until Jordan with the Chicago Bulls scored 63 against the Celtics in a first-round contest in 1986. Knee troubles began plaguing Baylor during the 1963-64 season, and many said he was never quite the same player afterward. Although he would never again average more than 30 points after 1962-63, he had five more All-Star seasons ahead and was a major scoring force for six of the next seven years, averaging at least 24 points in every season except 1965-66, when his output fell to 16.6 points per contest. The Lakers remained a winning team throughout those years, although they were constantly overshadowed by the Celtics, who won 11 championships in 13 seasons from 1956-57 through 1968-69. In 1965-66 Baylor\u2019s knee problems limited him to 65 games and a 16.6 scoring average. But West (31.3 ppg), Rudy LaRusso (15.4), and Walt Hazzard (13.7) picked up the slack as the Lakers won the Western Division and advanced to the NBA Finals for the third time in four seasons. Once again they ran into the Celtics who were poised for a rout after taking a 3-1series lead. In Game 5, Baylor ripped the net for 41 points and led the Lakers to a 121-117 win in Boston. After taking Game 6, the Lakers ran out of steam as the Celtics escaped with a 95-93 Game 7 win and another title. Two games into the 1970-71 season Baylor went down with a knee injury that all but ended his career. He missed the rest of the campaign and then returned for only nine games in 1971-72 before retiring at age 37. Ironically, later that season the Lakers won their first championship since moving to Los Angeles. Baylor had ended an illustrious 14-year career without a championship ring. Shortly after his playing career came to a close, Baylor tried his hand at coaching. He was hired by the expansion New Orleans Jazz as an assistant coach for the team\u2019s inaugural 1974-75 season. He served two full years in that capacity before replacing Butch van Breda Kolff as head coach early in the 1976-77 campaign. Baylor guided the young Jazz for the rest of that season and for the next two seasons, compiling an 86-135 record. His teams failed to reach the playoffs and finished no better than fifth in the Central Division. Baylor stepped down after the 1978-79 season. During his coaching stint with the Jazz, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1980 he was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team, and in 1996, he was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. Baylor won named NBA Executive of the Year in 2006, when the Clippers would win their first playoff series since 1976. He resigned from his post in L.A. in October of 2008 and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the team in February 2009, claiming he was \u201cdiscriminated against and unceremoniously released from his position with the team on account of his age and his race.\u201d In 2011, a jury rejected his claim of age discrimination and harassment and declined to award him any damages. The racism allegations and all allegations against the league were dropped by his attorneys before that trial. Baylor was made a permanent fixture outside the Staples Center in Los Angeles in April of 2018 when the Lakers unveiled a statue of him outside the arena. Baylor\u2019s statue was, at the time, the sixth that decorates the front of Staples Center, joining West, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and Chick Hearn.

Ariza is the most swapped player in NBA history; he\u2019s now with the Heat \u2014 his fourth team since the end of the 2019-20 season \u2014 and therefore is running up a collection of jerseys with his name on the back. Ariza has received a phone call wishing him well in the future from his general manager 11 times. Most of his trades were done for convenience, either for salary cap reasons or his team needed help at another position or simply didn\u2019t feel Ariza was in its present or future plans. That\u2019s why Oklahoma City sent him to the Heat for nothing. Meyers Leonard was told by OKC not to bother showing up and will also decline Leonard\u2019s option for next season. And by the way, Ariza never stepped foot in OKC, either; he was held out for this very reason \u2014 a trade. Ariza has been a decent player in his career. However, trading All-Stars are more complicated. Those are only done if the player becomes devalued for any reason, or gets disgruntled with the direction of the club, or turns old. Trading a star once isn\u2019t too unusual; more than once is odd. With the NBA trade deadline approaching \u2014 and Ariza apparently not on the block \u2014 on March 25, here\u2019s a list of 10 current or past All Stars who have been dealt at least twice, and the circumstances that made them happen. Dwight Howard (traded four times): In a pure and perfect world, Howard would still be with Orlando, where his career began, where it was built, where his legacy was at its highest and best. But: Howard became ornery and quirky and burned his way out of town \u2014 remember the uncomfortable Dwightmare period where he and the Orlando Magic tried and failed to prevent a divorce? Since then, Howard has stayed in places where his welcome was quickly worn out: A poor relationship with Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in L.A., another one in Houston with James Harden, a return to his home city in Atlanta that fell flat and then being dumped on the Hornets who had no use for him. From there, the future Hall of Famer has lived on a steady diet of cheap short-term free agent deals at various stops; at least one, a return to the Lakers, resulted in a championship. Chris Paul (four times): Of all the trades involving Paul, the one that stands out is the one that didn\u2019t happen: Paul to the Lakers, where he would have teamed up with Kobe. But the pre-Pelicans Hornets were in disarray then, and the league had to step in to manage the club, and commissioner David Stern didn\u2019t think the Hornets received enough in return so he vetoed the deal. Eventually, Paul was sent to the Clippers, where \u201cLob City\u201d was born but, unfortunately, no championship followed. Since then, Paul has traveled to places where he made a difference. With the Rockets, he helped Houston and James Harden to the brink of a Finals appearance in 2018 before a costly hamstring injury benched him in the West finals with the Rockets up 3-2 on the Golden State Warriors. With the Thunder, Paul was a solid leader and All-Star during his one season in OKC. And now with the Suns, he\u2019s a difference-maker for a once-perennial basement-dweller that\u2019s now among the best in the West. Carmelo Anthony (four times): His trade from the Nuggets to the Knicks in 2011 had quite the ripple effect. Remember, this was when Anthony was nearing his peak as a lethal scorer, and so he had value and also leverage because he was in a contract year. Rather than wait three months and sign him outright in free agency, the Knicks (strongly encouraged by owner James Dolan) traded a chunk of their rotation for Melo. This caused the hasty departure of GM Donnie Walsh, built the Nuggets into a consistent 50-game winner, enhanced then-Nuggets GM Masai Ujiri\u2019s reputation as a deal-maker and turned Melo into a New York savior at least for six years. Least memorable is when Anthony was traded to the Hawks in 2018. That might be the shortest and most forgettable stint in recent NBA history involving a player of his magnitude. His five-day, no-play stay in Atlanta ended with a buyout, and it was sandwiched between other forgettable stays, first in Oklahoma City and then Houston, where Melo began his free-fall from stardom. In between those stays, Anthony logged trade No. 4 when he was dealt to the Bulls (but never played there either) in 2019. Neither the Rockets nor the Thunder knew how to use his skills, and just as well, as a former franchise player with the Nuggets and Knicks, Anthony wouldn\u2019t embrace being a role player, not like now with the Blazers. Jimmy Butler (three times): Not long ago, Butler said he never saw himself leaving the Bulls, the team that drafted him. But the business of basketball had other ideas, and three teams later, Butler is in Miami with the Heat, where he\u2019s enjoying his best times. There\u2019s no question about his worst time: Minnesota. That was an experience that barely lasted more than a season, and very little of it memorable except for the infamous team scrimmage which quickly became legend. That\u2019s when Butler and four bench players whipped the other starters, with Butler talking smack the entire time, as if to prove a point about the Wolves\u2019 lack of killer instinct. Minnesota, by the way, surrendered Zach LaVine to the Bulls to get Butler, and has nothing to show for the subsequent trade that sent Butler to Philly. James Harden (twice): The first trade broke up a potential dynasty, the second one broke a franchise. Each time he left town \u2014 first in OKC (in 2012) and then Houston (2021) \u2014 Harden left shattered pieces if not feelings. Leaving the Thunder will always be debated for decades as Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook reached The Finals before any of them turned 25. Naturally, the future of the franchise seemed solid. But with Harden\u2019s rookie contract still having another year to run, OKC panicked, refused to give a sixth man (at the time) $54 million over four years while knowing Durant and Westbrook would cost more, and sent him to Houston. Given his own team to run, Harden became a superstar and the Rockets tried admirably yet failed to build a championship nucleus around him. When those attempts were exhausted, Harden surrendered. His exit strategy was to moan, whine, report late and disrupt enough to force the Rockets to accelerate his departure. It worked, as Harden is in Brooklyn and reunited with Durant. They\u2019re poised to travel further in the postseason than he ever did in Houston, which is in shambles. Russell Westbrook (twice): He was destined to spend his entire career in OKC mainly because the Thunder super-maxed him and also the club needed a credible player after Durant (and before him, Harden) left town. But once Paul George leveraged his way to the LA Clippers to join a new co-star (Kawhi Leonard), OKC was left with a dilemma: Rebuild around Westbrook \u2014 who, at this point, began to show decline \u2014 or press the red button and scrub him (and more importantly, his remaining salary) off the roster? That began a process of Westbrook\u2019s bloated salary being kicked to someone else, with OKC preceding the Rockets preceding the Wizards, and here we are. With his shooting range shrinking by the minute while his salary soars into the $40 million-a-year range, Westbrook is no longer an All-Star. We\u2019ve all seen this movie before: he\u2019ll either be a buyout guy or his contract will be kicked to someone else. Paul George (twice): George has the distinction of not once, but twice asking to be traded from a team that didn\u2019t want to let him leave. This became fodder for Damian Lillard last fall when the two stars trolled each other during their bubble dust-up . The good news for George is not only did he wind up where he ultimately wanted to be \u2014 Los Angeles \u2014 but with the Clippers he probably has a better shot at contending for a title than in Indiana and OKC. Plus, he signed a whopping contract extension two months ago , so what\u2019s not to like from his end? His trade from the Pacers was harder on the locals than when OKC shipped him. George only played two seasons there and so the roots didn\u2019t run as deep (he was drafted by and spent seven seasons with the Pacers). Still, as a multiple All-Star and All-NBA selection with the Pacers, he should have his jersey retired in Indiana \u2026 but that\u2019s probably not in the works. Kyle Lowry (twice): It\u2019s easy to forget Lowry once had a previous NBA life. Even tougher to comprehend that in this previous life is that he couldn\u2019t beat out Aaron Brooks for the starting point guard spot. But, while strange, it\u2019s true: Lowry was a steady-but-unspectacular player before he joined the Raptors and made himself a champion and potential Hall of Famer. Before backing up Brooks in Houston (Lowry eventually became the starter for the Rockets), Lowry lost out to Mike Conley in Memphis. He became unhappy, and the Grizzlies did him a solid by sending him to the Rockets, who in turn did him a bigger one by jettisoning him to Canada. Long story short: Other than Vince Carter, nobody has had a bigger impact on basketball Up North than Lowry. Andre Iguodala (three times): Iguodala has been with five teams but joined two essentially through free agency (Denver and Golden State). He then was a Warriors\u2019 trade casualty because the club needed to refresh after three championships and was dealt to Memphis. Then Iguodala became part of a trend: He stayed away, by mutual agreement, from the rebuilding Grizzlies until the team could trade him. In Miami, Iguodala is valued for his wisdom and leadership. However, it\u2019s also clear his best basketball was two teams ago. Jrue Holiday (twice): He\u2019s probably the league\u2019s most valuable player despite having made only one All-Star team (and that was eight seasons ago) and no All-NBA teams. Why\u2019s this? Because Holiday indirectly was involved in desperate attempts by his team to keep its franchise player happy and in town. Holiday was traded from Philly to New Orleans in 2013 mainly so he could compliment Anthony Davis, and four years later was given a big extension mainly to pacify Davis. But Davis demanded out anyway two years after that. Last fall, Holiday was sent to the Bucks mainly to pacify Giannis Antetokounmpo, who then signed a supermax contract. Good news also for Jrue: He\u2019ll have the hammer this summer during contract negotiations because the Bucks must sign him or else have nothing to show for a trade that cost them a handful of first-round picks. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In collecting career assist No. 10,0000, Paul only further bolstered his legendary status in the game. The 11-time All-Star hit 10,000 assists in spectacular fashion, throwing a perfect alley-oop pass to big man Deandre Ayton, who was streaking down the lane and finished with a powerful two-handed jam. Paul finished with a triple-double on Sunday, contributing 11 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in Phoenix\u2019s 111-94 win. In notching that dime, Paul became the sixth player in NBA history to reach the 10,000-assist milestone along with John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Mark Jackson and Magic Johnson. At his current rate, Paul will pass Johnson this season and might catch Jackson and Nash. Here are a couple of stats takeaways from Paul in the wake of his milestone moment \u2026 1. Paul has connected with several players en route to his 10,000 assists , but no one more than with Blake Griffin. When Paul and Griffin were on the LA Clippers (from 2011-16), Paul dished out 1,157 of his assists to Griffin. After that, his second-most assisted-to teammate was David West \u2014 which coincided with West and Paul being teammates on the New Orleans Hornets (2005-11) as he found him for 1,120 of his dimes. 2. While Paul has played for five franchises in his career , he racked up the most of his career assists with his first NBA team, the Hornets. Here\u2019s a team-by-team breakdown of his assists by team in his career \u2026 3. In his 16th NBA season, Paul ranks fifth in the NBA with 8.8 assists per game. If he maintains his spot, this would be Paul\u2019s 13th season ranking in the top five in assists per game. He owns four assist titles \u2014 2007-08 and 2008-09 with New Orleans; 2013-14 and 2014-15 with LA Clippers \u2014 and has just one season where he finished lower than seventh place in his career."},{"id":516887,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10000-and-counting-the-point-god-shows-no-signs-of-age","date":"2021-03-22","title":"10,000 and counting: Chris Paul shows no signs of age","content":"PHOENIX \u2014 Chris Paul says he knows the secret for why he\u2019s still a dominant NBA point guard at an age when most of his peers are getting into coaching or figuring out their next steps in life. \u201cI told the guys in the locker room I\u2019ve got the easy job,\u201d Paul said grinning. \u201cI just pass it to them.\u201d The 35-year-old Paul continued adding to the resume of his Hall of Fame-worthy career on Sunday night, passing 10,000 assists in the Phoenix Suns\u2019 111-94 victory against the Los Angeles Lakers.

I remember when he was in college at Wake Forest and no one could see this on the horizon. It comes down to a lot of hard work, sacrifice, an unreal family that he comes from and a dedication to the game.\u201d Williams and Paul have a unique relationship, operating almost as equals instead of the usual coach-player dynamic. The two have known each other for years and Williams was Paul\u2019s coach in New Orleans a decade ago. Now they\u2019re reunited and Williams is proud to call Paul a friend. \u201cChris is somebody I\u2019ll ask for advice,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody that I can tell the truth to and he can tell me the truth. You\u2019d have to ask him, but I value our relationship now because we\u2019re both older.\u201d Later Williams added: \u201cWhen we\u2019re done with this I\u2019m going to be checking up on his kids when they\u2019re getting 10,000 assists when they\u2019re in the league.

Now teammates, the 24-year-old said it\u2019s been a privilege to get an up close look at Paul\u2019s relentless routine of eating right and taking care of his body. \u201cAll the nicknames he gets, he fully deserves,\u201d Booker said. \u201c\u2018The Point God,\u2019 everything. \u2026 You see no slippage.\u201d Paul\u2019s in his 16th season in the league but he\u2019s still playing at an elite level. He made his 11th All-Star team earlier this year and is averaging about 16 points and nine assists per game.

Teams near the bottom could line up over on the left as the franchises most willing to part with a proven veteran or solid mid-career role player, based on accepting their plights as rebuilding or at least lottery-bound operations. Teams near the top, meanwhile, were lined up to the right as those most likely to be seeking help, a transformative starter or even a surgically added piece who might push them up a berth or two and, perhaps, extend their postseason to something memorable. Now, though, it\u2019s not so easy to find the sellers. And without sellers, wannbe buyers might have to sit on their wallets. Low inventories of available players can either bid up their prices \u2013 or it can dry up the market quickly. What\u2019s going on? This is Year 2 of the NBA\u2019s play-in mechanism, which gives even sputtering and clearly flawed teams hope that they can get in on some playoff action. For context, let\u2019s go back two years ago to the 2018-19 season, the last pre-pandemic \u201cnormal\u201d NBA campaign. By the trade deadline of Feb. 8, 14 of the 16 eventual playoff teams already were spoken for. The West was set, with the top eight teams at the deadline maintaining their playoff spots to the end. Five teams were under .500 and all five stayed that way. In the East, six teams headed to the postseason already held down the top six spots. That left two \u2013 Orlando and Detroit \u2013 who finished in a rush to leap-frog Charlotte and Miami. But in this conference too, the bottom five teams at the trade deadline were the same bottom five when the regular season ended. So that meant a third of the league\u2019s 30 teams were playing for lottery odds or something in the future, presumably making them willing at least to entertain offers for key players. This season? Only three or maybe four teams \u2013 Minnesota and Houston in the West, Detroit and possibly Orlando in the East \u2013 truly seem to be out of it. Everyone else, particularly those in the Nos. 9-13 spots, might choose to keep their powder dry for a possible play-in opportunity. Expanded this year from the Orlando bubble version in 2020, the play-in system will pit No. 7 vs. No. 8 and No. 9 vs. No. 10. The winner of the former game will qualify as the seventh seed and the loser of the latter game will be eliminated. Then the loser of 7-8 will face the winner of 9-10, with the team that wins that one earning the eighth seed. After that, it\u2019s traditional best-of-seven playoff series. That\u2019s why Chicago, Indiana and Toronto currently are in good shape competing for the East\u2019s No. 9 and No. 10 spots. Even Washington and Cleveland can see the possibility of snagging one of those. In the West, Golden State at No. 9 and Sacramento at No. 13 were separated heading into Sunday\u2019s games by only 4.5 games with about 30 to go. Getting a taste of the postseason, even via a play-in game or two, might be considering edifying enough to keep one\u2019s roster intact and focused. Meanwhile, the logical fear of qualifying simply to face a pummeling against a dominant No. 1 or No. 2 team might be quelled by softness at or near the top in both conferences. Philadelphia, Brooklyn and the Lakers have had injury issues, Phoenix is sniffing rarefied air for the first time with its core and Utah was 4-5 in its past nine games through Friday. The allure of the Draft always is strong, both in reality and as a marketing tool for cranky fan bases. But remember, the lottery odds were flattened in 2019 to disincentivize losing. It\u2019s nearly a coin flip now that the team with the league\u2019s worst record will snag the No. 1 pick (52.1%) or slip to No. 5 (47.9%). The three teams with the worst records all have the same odds of either getting the top pick or falling out of the top three. And the top four slots are determined by lottery these days, rather than top three previously. That all adds an element of \u201cwhy not push for the play-in?\u201d to what\u2019s left of the regular season. That\u2019s why differentiating the sellers from the buyers in that sweet spot of play-in possibilities is trickier this year. A team such as New Orleans might choose to step back and deal away Lonzo Ball, while another such as the Cavaliers might hang onto a Larry Nance Jr. The Bulls seem more driven to be part of the postseason action, however brief, than to move Lauri Markkanen or a perfect-for-a-contender Thaddeus Young. The NBA, through the play-in mechanism, might have juiced the chase for playoff spots even as it dampened the activity at the trade deadline. And that seems like a trade about which the league can be happy. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In fact, Irving has at least 37 FanDuel points in 13 of his last 14 games, providing a 46-point average in that span. That\u2019s right on par with what his pricing says, but this matchup makes him nearly impossible to avoid. Washington plays at the fastest pace in the NBA while surrendering the third-most fantasy points to opposing shooting guards. Maxi Kleber (DAL) $3,800 Kleber has been hard to trust in DFS for quite some time, but his role is monstrous right now. He\u2019s reached at least 28 minutes in eight-straight outings, averaging 23.4 FD points per game across 34 minutes a night in that span. That 34-minute total is the real key here because Kleber can be a fantasy-point-per-minute player. In this same matchup on Friday, he showed that, dropping 30 FanDuel points against this subpar Portland defense. Ben Simmons (PHI) $8,500 With Joel Embiid out of the lineup, Simmons is being asked to do a ton more. Simmons is averaging 1.3 FD points per minute with him off the floor, which is an incredible rate from a guy who should play 35-40 minutes here. That would equate to 46 FD points in 35 minutes of play which is all you can hope for from a sub-$9K player. UPDATE: Simmons was ruled out of Saturday\u2019s game and is questionable here. If he sits, look for Shake Milton and Mattisse Thybulle to be good values. Mason Plumlee (DET) $6,000 Plumlee\u2019s minutes and price have been dropping, but his production hasn\u2019t. Over his last 17 games played, Plumlee is averaging 35 FD points per game in less than 30 minutes a night. That makes this $6K price tag hard to figure, especially against a Bulls team that surrenders the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing centers. Josh Richardson (DAL) $5,200 Dallas has been playing much better over the last month, and J-Rich is a major reason why. Since February 1, Richardson is averaging over 26 FD points per game across 33 minutes a night. That\u2019s a hefty sample size of 5X production, and it makes it hard to believe he\u2019s only $5,200. The matchup against Portland is pretty, too, with the Trail Blazers ranked 29th in defensive efficiency. Delon Wright (DET) $6,200 Wright\u2019s pricing has been off for most of the season, and it makes no sense why. In the 21 games before his injury, Delon averaged 32 FD points per game. You\u2019d think his production has fallen off with this price tag, but he\u2019s scored at least 30 fantasy points in four-straight fixtures, averaging 35.4 FD points per game in that span. What makes it even more peculiar is that Chicago ranks fifth in pace and 24th in total defense. Larry Nance Jr. (CLE) $5,300 Nance has had a very similar season to Wright. The big man averaged 31.4 FD points per game across 35 minutes a night in his first 15 games before an injury and has shown some of that form recently. Larry has played at least 34 minutes in each of his last three games, averaging 34 fantasy points per game in that span. Toronto isn\u2019t too shabby of a matchup either, surrendering the third-most fantasy points to opposing power forwards. Dennis Schroder (LAL) $6,100 We like Schroder no matter what, but he\u2019s an absolute lock with LeBron James out. He\u2019s already been good without Anthony Davis anyway, averaging over 31 FD points per game with him sitting this year. Look for that to be his floor without LBJ. Robert Covington (POR) $6,100 Covington was horrendous in his first month with Portland, but he\u2019s become the defensive stud we all know and love recently. In fact, he\u2019s averaging 32 FD points per game across 36 minutes a night over his last 16 outings. He\u2019s done a lot of that damage through hustle statistics, and it\u2019s crazy to think how nice of a line he could have if some threes go down. That could definitely happen here, with Dallas ranked 24th in defensive efficiency. Tomas Satoransky (CHI) $4,400 Satoransky has found himself as the starting point guard in Chicago, and it\u2019s done wonders for his fantasy value. He actually averaged 25 FD points per game in this same role last year and is averaging 26 fantasy points per game across his first four starts this year. You really can\u2019t ask for more from someone this cheap, and it makes him one of the best punt plays on the board."},{"id":515850,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-leaves-lakers-game-with-right-ankle-injury-will-not-return","date":"2021-03-20","title":"LeBron James out indefinitely with high ankle sprain","content":"LeBron James left in the second quarter with a high right ankle sprain that the Lakers said will sideline him indefinitely, and Los Angeles went on to fall 99-94 to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday. Two hours after the game, the Lakers announced that James is out indefinitely. The defending NBA champions already are without All-NBA big man Anthony Davis, who has missed 14 consecutive games with a right calf injury and likely won\u2019t play again until April. \u201cNothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates!\u201d James tweeted later Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m hurt inside and out right now. The road back from recovery begins now. Back soon like I never left.\u201d James was hurt when he rolled his ankle under Solomon Hill, who was called for a foul as he reached awkwardly for a steal. The 36-year-old superstar screamed and fell to the court clutching at his ankle, yet he got up and briefly stayed in the game. \u201cI haven\u2019t necessarily seen him scream and squall like that, probably ever, not even with that groin,\u201d said Kyle Kuzma, who was with the Lakers when James missed 17 games with a groin injury two seasons ago. \u201cIt had to hurt a little bit, for sure.\u201d After the injury, James hit a corner 3-pointer that extended his NBA-record streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,036, but he called a timeout and left the court shortly afterward. James knocked over a chair in frustration as he went to the locker room. \u201cThe mood of the team is we\u2019re disappointed we lost, and we\u2019ve got to come back and get one tomorrow,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cI won\u2019t disclose what LeBron was like (in the locker room). It\u2019s in-house.\u201d John Collins had 27 points and a season-high 16 rebounds, and Trae Young added 14 points and 11 assists for the Hawks. They opened an eight-game trip with their eighth straight victory under new coach Nate McMillan \u2014 but only after their defending champion opponents lost their 17-time All-Star to an injury that could shake the NBA\u2019s balance of power if it turns out to be serious. With James out, the remaining Lakers rallied and actually took a one-point lead to halftime, but missed their first 11 shots of the second half. Danilo Gallinari scored 14 of his 18 points after halftime for the Hawks, who are on their longest winning streak since January 2015. \u201cThat was the first thing I told the guys: We can\u2019t relax because LeBron is out of the game,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWe have to keep up the pressure, and I thought our guys did that.\u201d James\u2019 absence left the Lakers without three starters in the second half, and the Hawks capitalized for their first road victory over Los Angeles since March 2016. Along with Davis, Marc Gasol missed his seventh straight game since February after sitting out under the NBA\u2019s health and safety protocols. Recovery rates vary, but high ankle sprains typically take anywhere from six weeks to three months to mend. The Lakers\u2019 final regular season game is in roughly two months, on May 16. James had missed just one game this season, when a left ankle sprain kept him out against the Kings in the final game before the All-Star break. He hasn\u2019t missed significant time since a hamstring injury cost him 17 straight games midway through the 2018-19 season. Per ESPN Stats & Info, it will mark only the fifth time in James\u2019 18-year career that he\u2019s missed at least five consecutive games.

Over that three-game stretch, he\u2019s averaged over 34 FanDuel points per contest and now faces a Spurs squad that surrenders the third-most FanDuel points to opposing point guards this season. Andrew Wiggins (SG \u2013 GS) $5,200 Wiggins sees an elite 28.7% usage rate without Steph Curry on the floor this season, as evidenced by his 40-point explosion on the Grizzlies Friday night. With Curry doubtful to suit up on Saturday, the Warriors will have to run their offense through Wiggins once more. Look for the 26 year old to hoist 20+ shots and flirt with 7-8X value with upside for more. Keldon Johnson (SF \u2013 SAS) $4,800 Johnson exploded with a 23-point, 21-rebound performance in Friday\u2019s win over the Cavaliers and is back at it again as the Spurs play on the second leg of a back-to-back set. The Bucks have been stingy against opposing small forwards, but Johnson is feeling it at the moment. He\u2019s currently seeing a 21% usage rate without LeMarcus Aldridge on the floor. Draymond Green (PF \u2013 GS) $6,600 Green has been out of this world from a fantasy perspective over his last few games. He\u2019s posted at least 39.7 FanDuel points in three of his last four games and is averaging 10.2 rebounds and 10.2 assists over his last four games. If Steph Curry sits, the Warriors will lean heavily on him to facilitate the offense once again. Dwight Howard (C \u2013 PHI) $5,000 Howard has seen 29 and 27 minutes respectively over his last two games and has logged a double-double in each of them. He\u2019s now gifted a dream matchup against a Kings\u2019 defense that is giving up the second-most FanDuel points to opposing centers this season. On top of that, this matchup boasts the highest over-under on the slate, so the 35-year-old vet should have plenty of chances to produce value. Jordan Poole (PG \u2013 GS) $4,600 Poole has averaged 20 points over his last six games and would be in line for an expanded role if Steph Curry were to sit once again. The 21 year old can be a bit scoring dependent, thus adding to his risk, but is fresh off a 25-point outing against the Grizzlies on Friday. Bismack Biyombo (C \u2013 CHA) $3,600 Biyombo will be given a larger role on Saturday, with Cody Zeller officially ruled out. In 820 minutes with Zeller off the court this season, Biyombo is averaging 0.81 FanDuel points per minute. Tyrese Maxey (SG \u2013 PHI) $3,500 There is certainly risk associated here, but this is the kind of player to target on small slates such as this one. Maxey should see some increased run with Seth Curry officially ruled out, and the Kings are giving up the most FanDuel points to opposing guards this season. The 20-year old rookie sees a 23% usage rate with Curry off the floor. Desmond Bane (SG \u2013 MEM) $3,500 The rookie sharpshooter is knocking down 44% of his 3s this season and faces a Warriors team that is middle of the pack when it comes to defending the perimeter. Bane is a risky pick due to his low floor, but he could be a lucrative play if he hits. Harrison Barnes (SF \u2013 SAC) $5,900 Barnes sees heavy minutes for the Kings and has scored over 33 FanDuel points in his last two contests. As previously mentioned, this matchup has the highest over-under on the slate, so Barnes should have ample time to produce value."},{"id":515713,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/keldon-johnson-racks-up-spurs-1st-20-20-game-since-tim-duncan","date":"2021-03-20","title":"Keldon Johnson racks up Spurs' 1st 20-20 game since Tim Duncan","content":"The Spurs are doing their Spurs-y best, somehow comfortably residing in the Play-In places and threatening to steal one of those solid top 6 seeds, even in this crowded West.

Tucker says a move to the championship-contending Milwaukee Bucks offers the 35-year-old veteran a breath of fresh air and a chance to turn around a frustrating season. Tucker practiced with his new team Friday after the Bucks officially announced they had acquired the 6-foot-5 forward along with guard Rodions Kurucs from the Houston Rockets The Bucks sent guard D.J. Augustin plus forward D.J. Wilson to Houston. As part of the trade, the Bucks gave up their 2021 and 2023 first-round picks and got back their own 2022 first-round pick and the Rockets\u2019 2021 second-round selection. \u201cMan, I was nipping at the bit today to get in practice, to get in there just to hit bodies and talk and be with the guys,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt felt great. It feels good just to have my battery recharged.\u201d Tucker gives the Bucks a solid defender and quality 3-point shooter \u2013 especially from the corners \u2013 as they bid for their first NBA title since 1971. Bucks general manager Jon Horst said in a statement that Tucker \u201cchecks all the boxes\u201d with his versatility and all-around game. \u201cHis defense is at an elite level,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. Budenholzer cited \u201chis ability to guard multiple positions, his ability to guard the best players in the league, the physicality he brings to that level of the court, the playoff experience he brings and the ability to space the court, make 3\u2019s, play the right way, play smart with high basketball IQ.\u201d Tucker hasn\u2019t played in a game since March 3 but is expected to be available Saturday when the Bucks host the San Antonio Spurs. The Rockets said last week they were attempting to trade Tucker, who is in the final season of a $31.8 million, four-year contract. Tucker had started each of the 32 games in which he appeared and was averaging 4.4 points as the Rockets have struggled after dealing Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Tucker was shooting 31.4% from 3-point range but had been a more reliable 3-point shooter in previous seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating year from all standpoints,\u201d Tucker said. Tucker leaves behind a team that was near the bottom of the Western Conference standings to join a club competing for the top seed in the East. The Rockets have suffered a franchise-record 19 consecutive losses, including a 113-100 setback against the Detroit Pistons on Friday night. The Bucks (26-14) have won five straight games and nine of their last 10, putting them 1 1\/2 games behind Philadelphia and Brooklyn in the Eastern Conference standings. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve got a chance to win a championship and do something special,\u201d Tucker said. The addition of Tucker continues the reshaping of Milwaukee\u2019s roster that began with the offseason acquisition of Jrue Holiday. Tucker looks forward to the opportunity to play with two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cAs soon as I see Giannis today, he looked at me and I looked at him and we both said the same thing,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I don\u2019t have to go against you no more.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, and I don\u2019t have to guard you anymore.\u2019 We both laughed because we\u2019ve had some epic battles going at it. It definitely will be nice to be on the same side now.\u201d The Bucks acquired Tucker along with the 23-year-old Kurucs, who has played in 16 games for Brooklyn and Houston this season. Augustin, 33, was averaging 6.1 points, 3 assists and 19.3 minutes in his first season with Milwaukee after spending four seasons in Orlando. The 25-year-old Wilson had averaged 3.6 points in 12 games this season and hadn\u2019t been able to work his way into the Bucks\u2019 rotation."},{"id":515308,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/grizzlies-vp-rich-cho-speaks-out-against-attacks-on-asian-americans","date":"2021-03-20","title":"Grizzlies executive Rich Cho speaks out against attacks on Asian Americans","content":"Grizzlies VP of Basketball Strategy Rich Cho, one of the league\u2019s highest ranking Asian American executives, spoke out on the recent increase of attacks against Asian Americans.

He was 18 then. He\u2019s now 35, and that long-awaited Heat chance is about to happen. More than a year removed from his most recent NBA game, Ariza joined the Heat this week after being traded to Miami by Oklahoma City. The Heat are the 10th team Ariza will play for, and he said Friday that he believes he can help the reigning Eastern Conference champions in their playoff push. \u201cI always wanted to play for this franchise,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cIt\u2019s just someplace I always wanted to be. Most of my family is here, so it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m just ready to go out on the court and lace them up.\u201d The Heat swung the deal for Ariza on Wednesday, sending the Thunder a second-round pick. Meyers Leonard was also part of the trade to make the salary-matching component work; he won\u2019t play again this season because of a shoulder injury, and the Thunder have said he won\u2019t be an active member of their team. Leonard was suspended by the NBA earlier this month for using an anti-Semitic slur during the livestreaming of a video game. For the Heat, it is a low-risk, potentially high-reward move. \u201cHe\u2019s everything that Miami Heat organization players are about,\u201d Heat forward Jimmy Butler said. \u201cHard-nosed, defense, make shots, get everybody involved, team-first kind of guy. \u2026 I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s a part of our team.\u201d Ariza has averaged 10.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals in his career, one in which he has been traded 11 times. He was drafted by Isiah Thomas with the New York Knicks in the second round of the 2004 draft, then was either traded to or signed with these teams: Orlando, the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston (three times), New Orleans, Washington (twice), Phoenix, Sacramento, Portland, Detroit, Oklahoma City and now, Miami \u2014 the city where he was born. He\u2019s felt like he would fit with the Heat for a while. \u201cI just feel like it matches my style of person, period,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cI work hard, extremely hard worker, what you see is what you get.\u201d Ariza didn\u2019t accompany Portland to the bubble last summer for family reasons, and never played for Oklahoma City. He\u2019s been working out in Miami, anticipating that he would eventually be traded someplace. He\u2019s learning the new NBA policies about masks, testing and other ways to stay safe. That\u2019s the biggest adjustment he\u2019s making; the on-court things are the easy part, he said. \u201cThey let me know exactly what it is that I need to do, my spots,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cThe players have been great as far as bringing me along and catching me up to what they do here.\u201d"},{"id":515115,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/family-ties-gary-payton-ii-wins-g-league-defensive-player-award","date":"2021-03-19","title":"Family ties: Gary Payton II wins G League defensive player award","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Gary Payton II is following in his father\u2019s footsteps when it comes to elite defense.

Lillard leads all players in clutch points (124) and is shooting 60.3% from the field, 53.3% from 3-point range and 100% from the free throw line with the game on the line. \u2022 Luka Doncic scored a game-high 44 points in the first meeting with Portland. He has four 40-point games in 2020-21, tied with Nikola Jokic for the second-most 40-point games of the season. However, Lillard is tied with Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid with a league-high five 40-point games this season. The Mavs are 3-1 when Doncic scores 40 or more (the only loss came to Portland); the Blazers are 5-0 when Lillard scores 40 or more. \u2022 The Blazers and Mavericks both rank in the bottom four in the league in passes made per game (Portland 239.5, 30th; Dallas 268.1, 27th) and assists (Portland 20.1, 30th; Dallas 22.6, t-27th). Both teams rely heavily on isolation play as this matchup features three of the top 15 isolation scorers in the league: Damian Lillard (5.4 ppg, 2nd), Luka Doncic (4.7 ppg, 6th) and CJ McCollum (3.7 ppg, 13th). \u2022 The Blazers are 4-4 on second night of back-to-back this season, averaging 117.1 ppg in those eight games, which is 2.3 ppg higher than their season average (114.8, 9th in NBA).

Having already missed 10 of Philadelphia\u2019s first 41 games, Embiid could sit out an extended period due to a bone bruise in his left knee that was initially expected to keep him out two to three weeks. As colleague Steve Aschburner noted in his most recent Defensive Player Ladder , 1978 MVP Bill Walton is the only player to have ever won that award playing in fewer than 80% of his team\u2019s games. If Embiid\u2019s injury forces him to sit another seven games, he would finish at 55 games \u2014 provided he doesn\u2019t miss any more after \u2014 in a 72-game season, to put him at 76.4%. \u201cHe was happy it wasn\u2019t as bad as a lot of people thought it was, probably including himself,\u201d 76ers coach Doc Rivers said on Sunday. \u201cNow that he knows all it takes is rehab, he has a game plan, we have a game plan, and now we\u2019re moving forward with it.\u201d Other MVP candidates are trudging ahead, too. Nikola Jokic moves into the No. 1 spot, while Damian Lillard continues to rise up the board along with reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who finally cracks the top five. Former Kia MVP James Harden is coming for one of the top spots as well, after cooking Indiana on Wednesday for his 100 th 40-point game . Harden tallied 10 rebounds and 15 assists in that game, too, to join Vince Carter as the only other Nets player to ever put together a 40-point triple-double. Harden is just the fourth player in league history to roll up 100 40-point games, and he joins elite company in Wilt Chamberlain (173), Michael Jordan (122) and Kobe Bryant (100). Harden pulled off the feat in 868 games played, which ranks as third in NBA history. Meanwhile, the performance against the Pacers marked Harden\u2019s 11 th triple-double this season and his 16 th career 40-point triple-double; good for No. 2 in NBA history behind only Oscar Robertson (22). So, keep an eye out for Harden, who is generating some serious momentum in helping Brooklyn to victory in 14 of its last 15 games. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 27.1 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 8.6 apg, 1.6 spg He racked up his 10 th triple-double to help Denver captured its seventh win in eight outings, playing just 28 minutes and three quarters while scoring 12 points on seven shots. The performance marked a record-setting night around the NBA , as six players around the league put up triple-doubles. Jokic dished 10 of Denver\u2019s season-high 37 assists on the night, and also posted his 228 th career double-double to move past Dikembe Mutombo for the franchise record. Jokic leads the league this season in double-doubles with 36 in 40 contests . Last ranking: No. 4 Season stats: 30.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 7.8 apg Maybe people will finally realize that \u201cDame Time\u201d is a real thing. The man dropped a season-high 50 points Wednesday to help Portland rally from a 17-point, fourth-quarter deficit vs. New Orleans. The most eye-popping part of Lillard\u2019s night was the fact he scored 50 points on a ridiculous 20 shots, which ranks No. 3 for the fewest field-goal attempts during a 50-point night in the shot-clock era (1954-55), according to Elias Sports Bureau. Lillard scored 36 points Thursday in another win against the Pelicans and poured in 15 of the team\u2019s first 20 points. Last ranking: No. 7 Season stats: 29.1 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 6.2 apg, 1.3 spg, 1.3 bpg Similar to Stephen Curry, Antetokounmpo plays with a level of joy that\u2019s just fun to watch. We saw that Wednesday, as Milwaukee won its fifth-straight game after trailing by 14 at intermission. The reigning two-time Kia MVP, Antetokounmpo scored just four points in the first half, before erupting for 19 in the fourth quarter and overtime. Apparently, Antetokounmpo worked up an appetite for some of the Philadelphia local fare on the heels of the Bucks sweeping their latest three-game road trip. Antetokounmpo has put up 31 points or more in seven of his last 10 games , including three triple-doubles over that span. Last ranking: No. 3 Season stats: 25.5 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 8.0 apg, 1.1 spg James started off the week logging back-to-back triple-doubles, becoming the oldest player (36) in NBA history to accomplish that feat. James pushed his total to five triple-doubles on the season, and helped Los Angeles to a four-game winning streak out of the All-Star break after Thursday\u2019s 116-105 triumph against the Charlotte Hornets. James now ranks No. 20 all-time in games played (1,305). Too often, we get caught up in the offensive numbers. He\u2019s getting it done on defense , too. Still, the Lakers are 7-7 since Anthony Davis\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day injury. Last ranking: No. 1 Season stats: 29.9 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 3.3 apg, 1.2 spg, 1.4 bpg It\u2019s been a week since Embiid suffered a tough break on a nasty dunk in a win over the Washington Wizards, and it\u2019s estimated the All-Star big man could be out for the next two to three weeks due to a bone bruise in his left knee. Embiid is also a front-runner to win the 2021 Kia Defensive Player of the Year Award, but colleague Steve Aschburner makes a salient point here in pondering how the expected absence could negatively affect his candidacy for both awards. 6.

None of them \u2014 or any other Timberwolves rookie for that matter \u2014 scored as many points in his rookie season as Anthony Edwards did on Thursday night. The No. 1 overall pick of the 2020 draft poured in a career-high 42 points in Minnesota\u2019s stunning 123-119 win against the Phoenix Suns. The performance bests previous Timberwolves rookie nights by Zach LaVine (37), Karl-Anthony Towns (35), and Christian Laettner (35), and also surpasses Philadelphia\u2019s Tyrese Maxey for most points scored by a first-year player this season. At 19 years and 226 days old, Edwards becomes the third-youngest player in NBA history to score 40 or more in a game, trailing only LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Edwards is also the first rookie to score 40 or more points in a game since Grayson Allen dropped 40 on the LA Clippers as a rookie with the Utah Jazz on April 10, 2019. Edwards got to the rim at will against a Suns team boasting the fourth-best defensive rating in the league. He shot 11-for-18 inside the arc and earned a game-high 13 free throw attempts, too. His driving layup with 2 minutes, 36 seconds remaining put him past the 40-point mark and gave Minnesota the lead for good. Edwards has been unleashed since Timberwolves coach Chris Finch replaced Ryan Saunders on Feb. 22. In the 10 games since, the 6-foot-4 guard is averaging 24.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals while shooting a markedly improved 41.9% from the field. \u201cI put in the work,\u201d Edwards said after Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cI work in the dark.

Towns and Edwards become just the seventh pair of teammates to each score 40 or more in the same game over the last 20 seasons, and the first since Kawhi Leonard and Paul George did so on Dec. 13, 2019.

Thursday\u2019s victory pushes the Knicks (21-21) back to .500, good for a tie with idle Boston for seventh place in the Eastern Conference.

He\u2019s double-doubled in two straight games and put up at least 30 FD points in three of his last four games. There\u2019s a good chance Moses Brown, and Isaiah Roby will match up against him, and frankly, that\u2019s barbecue chicken. Anthony Edwards (SG \u2013 MIN): $7,100 at PHX The Rookie fears no one, not even the Suns. He\u2019s put up at least 35 FD points in four of his last five contests with 5.5x value over that span. He scored 25 points with five rebounds against the Suns in their first matchup this year, and fantasy managers should have no issues plugging Edwards into their lineup. With the Suns favored by 10.5 points, Edwards is ripe with opportunity. Deandre Ayton (C \u2013 PHO): $6,800 vs. MIN Roll with Ayton tonight because Minnesota is awful at defending opposing centers. They let up 43.1 FD points to the center position this season, ranking last in the NBA. Ayton got a 20 and 10 double-double in their first matchup (shooting 9-of-11 from the field), so he should be able to replicate these numbers. With an encouraging game total of 228.5, he\u2019ll have a big game if he can stay out of foul trouble. Lonzo Ball (PG \u2013 NOP): $6,700 at POR Ball\u2019s salary increased by $100 since last week, which is drastically understated considering his play as of late. He dropped 17 assists versus Portland on Tuesday and put up over 37 FD points in his last two games. Good thing he faces the Trail Blazers again on Thursday, as both teams play minimal defense and offer a ton of value given the projected high totals in a competitive matchup. Montrezl Harrell (C \u2013 LAL): $6,700 vs. CHA Harrell\u2019s been a monster. In his last three games, the reigning Sixth Man of the Year is averaging 23.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.7 assists with 1.7 steals, and 1.3 blocks across 29 minutes per game. He\u2019s put up over 41 FD points in three of his last four and faces a team that\u2019s allowed the eighth-most FD points per game to opposing centers. He\u2019s a mismatch against the Hornets frontcourt. Kyle Kuzma (PF \u2013 LAL): $6,000 vs. CHA Kuzma has been an excellent source of fantasy points in FanDuel lately, providing 6.0x value over his last five games. Even under 30 minutes, Kuzma is contributing off the bench for the Lakeshow. The Lakers are 8-point favorites, and with Charlotte playing the second game on a back-to-back, the Lakers bench will get plenty of time to produce, which bodes well for Kuzma. Danilo Gallinari (SF \u2013 ATL): $5,700 vs. OKC Gallinari is red-hot for the Hawks lately. He faces the Thunder, who let up the third-most Fanduel points to opposing small forwards this season (52.4 FD points). But how hot is Gallo? He\u2019s averaging 21.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.6 assists, with 1.2 steals and 4.0 threes in his last five games. With a revenge narrative in play against his former team, this is one of the slate\u2019s best value plays. Jaylen Nowell (SG \u2013 MIN) \u2013 $4,600 at PHO Also known as \u2018Father Christmas,\u2019 Nowell has been a revelation off the bench for the young Timberwolves, contributing 25.0 FD points per game over his last three games. Fellow FantasyPros expert Alex Burns has been touting Nowell for weeks, and in a potential blowout scenario, Nowell is a strong value play. Moses Brown (C \u2013 OKC): $4,400 at ATL Brown is taking full advantage of his playing time, registering 1.33 FD points per minute, and providing 5.9x value in his last five games. His per-36 minute averages are ridiculous \u2013 19.5 points with 15.4 rebounds. He scored 53.2 FD points against Chicago on Tuesday, and if Clint Capela sits, Brown could be in for another busy night. Ty Jerome (SG \u2013 OKC): $4,200 at ATL Theo Maledon is questionable, and Lu Dort is out, leaving Jerome with more opportunity to shine. He\u2019s provided at least 23 FD points in his last three games, seeing an average of 29 minutes per game. Jerome contributed 11.3 points, 4.3 assists and 4.3 rebounds over that span and has a 25-point ceiling in FanDuel tonight."},{"id":514502,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-nba-tv-thursday-march-18-2021","date":"2021-03-18","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: NBA TV Thursday, March 18, 2021","content":"Bradley Beal is averaging 35.6 points on the second night of a back-to-back this season. \u2022 The Jazz remain the only team ranked in the top five in both offensive (116.6, 2nd) and defensive (108.5, 4th) rating.

The NAACP has given him its Jackie Robinson Sports Award. And, for the first time, the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization is recognizing more than one person by honoring the WNBA Players Association. \u201cI would borrow a Maya Angelou quote to describe Steph and his leadership: \u2018I\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel,\u2019\u201d Warriors general manager Bob Myers said in an email. \u201cSteph has certainly made people in the Bay Area and all over the world feel joy. His commitment to social activism and support of women are another part of the fabric that makes up the person that he is. I\u2019m honored to know him for what he does both on and off the court,\u201d Myers added. \u201cAnd a much deserved congratulations to the women of the WNBA who continue to fearlessly pursue what is right.\u201d The 33-year-old Curry, Golden State\u2019s two-time MVP, held a YouTube question-and-answer forum with Fauci last March near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Jackie Robinson award \u2014 named for the late Dodgers great who broke baseball\u2019s racial barrier \u2014 recognizes athletes for their success as well as their commitment to social justice, civil rights and their communities. \u201cHe has a strong platform and he utilizes it to the best of his ability,\u201d teammate Kelly Oubre Jr. said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great individual.\u201d The WNBA players have been applauded for their activism in a unified movement that has featured kneeling for the national anthem, messages supporting Black Lives Matter and protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake in August by following the Bucks\u2019 lead in not playing. WNBA players also notably called out former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican and former co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, for her criticism of the league\u2019s social justice efforts. Some players sported T-shirts reading \u201cVote Warnock\u201d in support of Atlanta pastor Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who defeated Loeffler in a runoff race in January.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. Though they added playmaking and shooting in the offseason, the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 offense still falls off a cliff when Trae Young goes to the bench. The Hawks have scored 13.7 more points per 100 possessions with Young on the floor (116.2) than they have with him off the floor (102.5). That differential is down from last season ( 15.5 ), but is still the fourth biggest on-off OffRtg differential among players who\u2019ve played at least 500 minutes. The top 10 has a lot of the players you\u2019d expect \u2026 and Kelly Olynyk. Biggest on-off differential, team\u2019s points scored per 100 possessions eFG% = Player\u2019s effective field goal percentage. Minimum 500 minutes on the floor. Young is thought of as a shooter, but he\u2019s been the least effective shooter of that group. His effective field goal percentage* of 50.0% is well below the league average (53.8%) and ranks 106th among 136 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. Young has shot below the league average in the restricted area, on other shots in the paint, and from mid-range. His 3-point percentage (37.5%) is above average (36.7%), but ranks just 48th among 87 players who\u2019ve attempted at least five 3-pointers per game. And because only 60% of his shots have come from the restricted area or 3-point range (the league average is 70%), he\u2019s not maximizing his percentages. * Effective field goal percentage = (FGM + (0.5 * 3PM)) \/ FGA So how is Young such a difference maker on offense? First of all, he gets to and shoots well from the free throw line. Young\u2019s 9.5 free throw attempts per game rank third and his 87.3% ranks eighth among 37 players who\u2019ve averaged at least five attempts per game. On his first offensive possession after returning to the game in the second quarter on Tuesday, Young turned the corner on Jae\u2019Sean Tate and then, instead of taking off with one foot, hit the breaks to draw a foul under the basket\u2026 With free throws, Young is above the league average in regard to scoring efficiency. While his effective field goal percentage ranks 106th among those 136 players with at least 300 field goal attempts, Young\u2019s true shooting percentage* of 59.4% ranks 51st . * True shooting percentage = PTS \/ (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA))) And what really makes Young so important to the Hawks\u2019 offense is his passing. Young ranks third in the league at 9.4 assists per game. He\u2019s second in total assists in the restricted area (181) and seventh in assists on 3-pointers (308). Most of those assists come out of the pick-and-roll. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Young has used 1,982 ball screens, most in the league. That\u2019s 52.2 per game or 1.5 ball screens for every minute that he\u2019s been on the floor. And with all the reads that Young can make out of the pick-and-roll, you can understand the high volume. Young has 98 assists to John Collins and 79 assists to Clint Capela . Those are the second and third most assists from one player to a single teammate, topped only by Draymond Green\u2019s 108 assists to Stephen Curry. And in Capela and Collins, Young has two lob threats who can take advantage of the attention that their defender puts on Young in a pick-and-roll, even if no actual screen is set. According to Second Spectrum, there\u2019s been contact on less than half (47%) of the ball screens that the Hawks have set for Young. That rate is 57% for Luka Doncic and 59% for Damian Lillard, by comparison. Late in the second quarter on Tuesday, Collins slipped out of a screen for Young and got behind his defender for a lob \u2026 Young is about as good a lob passer as there is in the league. Here\u2019s one for Capela off a staggered screen (with contact), where Robin Lopez came out just far enough for Young to squeeze the pass between him and the non-committal weak-side tag from Russell Westbrook \u2026 If that weak-side defender takes away the lob, Young can kick out to the weak-side shooter \u2026 Or just wait things out and find another angle \u2026 Turnovers can be an issue. Young has the seventh highest turnover rate (12.3 per 100 possessions) among the 48 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. Against a switching defense, he can get stuck \u2026 But if he can gain an advantage somewhere, Young has the patience and vision to find what\u2019s open \u2026 The Hawks will go for their seventh straight win in a matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder tonight ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). On that game-winner against the Raptors last week, Young obviously got credit for the assist and Tony Snell, shooting an amazing 41-for-70 (59%) on catch-and-shoot 3s , got credit for making the shot, but Kevin Huerter also deserves acknowledgment for helping Snell get open. When Young turns the corner on Stanley Johnson, Kyle Lowry comes from the weak side (he was guarding Snell in the right corner) to help in the paint. That left Norman Powell guarding Snell and Huerter on the weak side \u2026 If both Snell and Huerter remain stationary, Powell can close out to either one. But Huerter sees Lowry\u2019s help and dives to the rim. That draws Powell into the paint and leaves Snell all alone on the right side of the floor. A weak-side dive behind (or in front of) a ball-watching defender can often turn into a highlight \u2026 It can also be an \u201cassist\u201d of sorts, drawing a weak-side defender into the paint to free up a teammate beyond the arc. On the same night of Snell\u2019s game-winner, the Suns got two open 3-pointers as a result of timely weak-side dives. First, a Mikal Bridges dive behind Nasir Little drew help from Damian Lillard and freed up Jae Crowder \u2026 Later, a Cameron Payne dive drew the attention of Rodney Hood and opened up a kick-out to Abdel Nader \u2026 We probably don\u2019t need to track \u201cdive assists\u201d like we do \u201c screen assists ,\u201d but the sacrificial dive man should be acknowledged. LaMelo Ball gets the headlines and Terry Rozier ( now 10-for-18 on clutch 3s ) hits the big shots, but a big reason why the Charlotte Hornets have seen the league\u2019s fifth biggest jump in offensive efficiency (they\u2019ve scored 5.3 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season) is the addition of Gordon Hayward, who is averaging a team-high (and efficient) 20.7 points per game. The Hornets like to run; They rank second in the percentage of their possessions that have been in transition (19.4%) and sixth in points per transition possession (1.16). Hayward had his own fast-break highlight on Monday, dunking on De\u2019Aaron Fox amid Charlotte\u2019s comeback from seven points down with 4 1\/2 minutes to go. But a staple of the Hornets\u2019 half-court offense is getting Hayward matched up with opposing guards. And we saw a lot of that in that win over Sacramento, with Hayward setting ball screens that the Kings switched, and then taking the guard into the post. Midway through the first quarter, Hayward set a \u201cpistol\u201d screen along the right sideline for Ball. Buddy Hield switched the screen and Hayward didn\u2019t let Fox get on the other side of him. With a perfect high-low pass from Cody Zeller (and a goaltending violation from Richaun Holmes), Hayward had a bucket \u2026 A few minutes later, Hayward set the same screen for Devonte\u2019 Graham, put Tyrese Haliburton on his back, and drew a foul (prior to the layup) \u2026 And later in the first quarter, Hayward set a \u201chorns\u201d screen for Graham, took Cory Joseph into the paint, and got an easy bucket \u2026 Midway through the third quarter, Hayward had Fox on him via another switch. But Holmes saw what was happening, drifted off of Bismack Biyombo and \u201cscrammed\u201d Fox, switching onto Hayward. Harrison Barnes slid down to take Biyombo, and Fox picked up Miles Bridges \u2026 The result was Rozier isolating against Hield and missing a contested shot in the paint. Hayward got another bucket against a Kings guard late in the fourth quarter. Matched up with Haliburton after a miss on the other end of the floor, he didn\u2019t need to set a screen. He just ducked in, nudged the rookie out of bounds, and had himself a layup \u2026 Hayward is only 6-foot-7, but he\u2019s strong and comfortable with his back to the basket. According to Second Spectrum tracking, he set the same number of ball screens last season with Boston (4.7 per game) as he has with Charlotte. But when he was screening for Kemba Walker, that was mostly to free up the point guard. A lot of those screens were part of \u201cdouble-drag\u201d actions meant for Walker to attack opposing bigs. With the Hornets, Hayward has more often set screens to get himself a bucket, in the mold of Dirk Nowitzki (ball-screen, take the guard to the nail, go to work). He has only 23 post-up possessions according to Synergy tracking, but that\u2019s up from 15 last season and the 1.35 points per possession Hayward has scored on post-ups ranks first among 79 players with at least 20 post-up possessions. The Hornets are most fun when they\u2019re getting up and down the floor. But Hayward is their best weapon for the more deliberate half-court offense that they need down the stretch of close games and in the playoffs. As they land in Los Angeles for a game against the Lakers on Thursday ( 10:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV ) and another against the Clippers on Saturday ( 10 p.m. ET, League Pass ), the Hornets are in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. But their loss in Denver on Wednesday began a stretch where they\u2019re playing seven of nine against teams that currently have winning records. The Eastern Conference still has just five teams over .500 , but it has a 53-35 record against the West over the last 30 days, with the sixth, seventh and eighth spots looking stronger than they did a month ago. That race to finish fifth or sixth (to avoid the Play-In Tournament) or seventh or eighth (to avoid the need to win two Play-In games to reach the playoffs) will be fun to watch. Anthony Davis has now missed the last 12 games for the Lakers. And while offense has been a struggle, the Lakers\u2019 defense has remained strong without its best defensive player. L.A. ranks sixth defensively (108.0 points allowed per 100 possessions) over the time that Davis has been out, and remains comfortably in the top spot for the season (106.0). A couple of possessions from the first quarter of the Lakers\u2019 win over the Warriors on Monday can show you why. On both occasions, Montrezl Harrell addresses the Stephen Curry threat by blitzing a handoff. On the first play, Wesley Matthews tags James Wiseman\u2019s roll and then recovers out to his man (Andrew Wiggins). Then Talen Horton-Tucker slides down to cover Wiseman until Harrell recovers. Horton-Tucker then recovers to his man (Kent Bazemore) with a controlled close-out and Bazemore misses from the corner after hesitating \u2026 On the second play, Matthews again tags the Wiseman roll. But when Curry throws a skip pass to Wiggins in the left corner, Kyle Kuzma rotates down. Dennis Schroder then leaves Curry (a risk, for sure) to rotate to Draymond Green. Horton-Tucker helps on Green\u2019s drive and then contests another Bazemore 3-pointer with another controlled close-out. The ensuing airball led to a Lakers\u2019 break \u2026 That\u2019s five defenders working hard and on a string. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Only one team \u2014 the New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 has publicly acknowledged a team-wide vaccination effort so far, doing so this past weekend after state rules in Louisiana were amended and made it possible for the team to start the process for players, coaches and staff. No one in the NBA will be considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after receiving the final vaccine dose. Once that happens, rules for some of those individuals will change, the NBA said in a memo sent early Thursday to teams and obtained by The Associated Press. Daily point-of-care testing will not be required for players or head coaches prior to entering team facilities, nor will testing still be required on days off. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said at the All-Star Game earlier this month that changes would be in store for those who choose to get the vaccine. \u201cRight now we operate under this so-called work quarantine protocol, where players are largely only going between their homes and the arenas,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOnce they get vaccinated, they\u2019ll be able to do more in their communities. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve already begun talking to the players association about. So, there will be some real advantages and benefits to getting vaccinated for the players.\u201d The contact tracing part of the new rules will be a major benefit. Being flagged by contact tracing has been an issue for many players this season including Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, both of whom had to miss the All-Star Game and the start of the season\u2019s second half because a barber that they visited tested positive \u2014 but they did not. Had they been fully vaccinated, they would not have had to miss any time even after being around someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Other benefits for those who are vaccinated, the league said, would include the ability to have other family members and friends visit their homes without a need for testing; being able to have visitors at the team hotel on road trips; eating outdoors at restaurants at home or on the road; and being able to commute to and from team facilities with other fully vaccinated individuals. And when a team has 85% of its personnel vaccinated, those individuals who got the shots will not be required to wear facemasks at their team\u2019s practice facility, may eat indoors or outdoors at restaurants as local rules allow, eat on flights, leave the team hotel more freely on road trips and schedule more user-friendly testing times. Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet revealed earlier this week that he tested positive for the virus and that his recovery process, at times, was not easy. VanVleet returned to the Raptors\u2019 lineup on Wednesday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here, I\u2019m alive, I\u2019m breathing and I know there\u2019s a lot of people that didn\u2019t make it through COVID. So, my thoughts and my heart are with the families and people that\u2019s been affected by this thing that weren\u2019t as fortunate as I was \u2014 as I am.\u201d The NBA said earlier this week that three new players out of 490 tested between March 10 and March 16 returned positive COVID-19 results. More than 100 players have tested positive this season, nearly half of them doing so in November just before training camps around the league opened."},{"id":514361,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-academies-get-a-moment-to-shine-in-ncaa-tournaments-spotlight","date":"2021-03-18","title":"NBA Academies get a moment to shine in NCAA Tournament's spotlight","content":"The annual basketball Big Top carnival known as the NCAA Tournament begins Thursday, and it will attract the usual eyeballs belonging to students, alums and highly stressed gamblers. Almost all of them will be confined to these shores, because March Madness is mainly a domestic phenomenon. And yet, increasingly, the reach is becoming more elastic, with curious observers sprouting in Africa and Australia and China and India. In certain pockets of these faraway places, there are rooting interests too, and maybe even a bracket or two is being filled out, albeit in a foreign language. They\u2019re paying special attention to Baylor. And Tennessee. And Iona. Those schools, and five others in the men\u2019s NCAA Tournament, have players who were weaned on NBA Academies in their countries and are now seeing the benefits of that early basketball training. The organizers, coaches and current participants in those programs are sensing something big and enduring is taking root as a result. Ultimately, the academies spread across Australia, China, India, Mexico and Senegal would love to see their teenaged graduates eventually graduate to the highest level of basketball. That would be the NBA, of course. But, baby steps. The grassroots program launched in 2016 , and some players are indeed professionals in other leagues. What began as a trickle into the NCAA has become a pipeline in such a short time. There are also academies for women that began in 2018 and eight players will be in the women\u2019s NCAA Tournament. The men\u2019s NCAA tourney \u2014 the world\u2019s most visible basketball platform outside the NBA \u2014 will showcase a few such players from the academies, namely Santiago Vescovi of Uruguay (who starts at point guard for Tennessee), Jonathan Tchatchoua of Cameroon (reserve forward for Baylor) and Nelly Junior Joseph of Nigeria (who\u2019s getting groomed by Rick Pitino at Iona). \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see all these players play on the biggest platform possible with March Madness,\u201d said Chris Ebersole, the NBA senior director who oversees the elite development of the academies. The academies are geared to roust basketball interest among teenagers, then identify those with the best potential, and then herd the most promising players to facilities and coaches so they can maximize their opportunity. It is year-round, hands-on and all-encompassing \u2014 elite players leave their families, live in dorms, travel for games and not only are exposed to basketball, but other benefits designed to aid their matriculation to colleges and beyond. The academies are offspring of Basketball Without Borders and the Jr. NBA , both NBA-backed programs designed to tap into underserved markets to find and nurture talent. A growing number of NBA players are discovered in this manner \u2014 it\u2019s up to 76 now that have made the jump to the NBA \u2014 most notably All-Stars Joel Embiid and Pascal Siakam as well as Jamal Murray \u2014 to name a few \u2014 from BWB. \u201cIt\u2019s a full-on, holistic program,\u201d said Ebersole of the academies. \u201cWe wanted to find players with a high amount of upside, give them the tools on and off the court to develop and put them on the pathway to ultimately a career in basketball. It\u2019s academics, life skills, strength and conditioning, nutrition, putting all those pieces together and put them on a pathway, whether to college basketball, G League, other pro leagues around the world, and of course the NBA.\u201d The NCAA Tournament, canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, will shed light on those trained by the academies. In addition to Vescovi, Junior Joseph and Tchatchoua, others who\u2019ll get a taste of the tournament are Francisco Caffaro (Virginia), Timothy Ighoefe (Georgetown), Anyang Garang (Oklahoma), Oumar Ballo (Gonzaga) and Olivier Maxence Prosper (Clemson). Tchatchoua only started playing basketball five years ago in Cameroon. While his friends naturally migrated to soccer, he began shooting on a hoop created by a broom stick, a basket and a soccer ball. The academy upgraded those tools and gave him a springboard. In a recent interview, he said: \u201cI went to this camp in Cameroon. I did okay \u2026 me and four other guys were selected for Basketball Without Borders. I did alright and got a scholarship to one of the first NBA Global Academy programs in Australia. In Africa, it\u2019s more about getting a scholarship to go to the U.S. My dad was all-in to get a scholarship in the U.S. I told him it was my dream. Australia was different, but it was backed up by the NBA, so I thought it was a good thing for me.\u201d Tchatchoua\u2019s nickname is \u201cEveryday John\u201d because of his personality and approach to basketball, which has obviously become a passion and he averages 6.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. And there\u2019s the likelihood that he could become part of a national-championship team, since Baylor enters the tournament as a strong favorite. Ebersole said: \u201cJonathan was one of our first players in the program when we started, the inaugural class of players in Australia. He joined our program when we had no track record. He took a leap with us and we\u2019ll always be grateful for him and the rest of those players in that inaugural program. To see it pay off for him is satisfying \u2026 his journey hasn\u2019t been the smoothest, he started at UNLV, sat out a year, then had the COVID year, and now he\u2019s having an impact with one of the best programs in the country.\u201d The task of placing academy grads in college is largely the role of Greg Collucci, a former college player and coach who\u2019s a senior manager of NBA academies. The elite players from the academies are showcased at the Final Four in a Saturday game labeled Next Generation Showcase, giving scores of NCAA coaches a first-hand look at potential talent without having to fly overseas to scout them. But for those coaches who do wish to use their passport, there\u2019s an academy showcase game each summer. There are 43 players who have made college rosters form the academies, and seven advanced to play professionally overseas. \u201cOnce the colleges coaches were able to get out and see how the players were doing and how much talent they have, it became tangible for college coaches and they were ready to begin the recruiting process,\u201d Collucci said. Junior Joseph was recently named the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year. After playing at the Senegal academy, he was a late arrival to campus and preseason practices. But, he caught on fast with Pitino and the Gaels to become one of the best front court players in the MAAC. Pitino said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of Nelly \u2026 he came to us late due to visa issues with the pandemic forcing shutdowns of the embassies in Senegal and Nigeria, only to deal with all of the COVID-19 related issues we\u2019ve had. He\u2019s been a pleasure to coach, always works hard and is willing to get better every day. We\u2019re excited for Nelly\u2019s potential to become an outstanding basketball player and his development will be very fun to watch.\u201d Likewise, Vescovi was a late arrival at Tennessee, yet impressed quickly and captured a starting job with the Volunteers. The clever guard was one of the better players for Tennessee\u2019s run in the SEC Tournament semifinals and already a team leader. \u201cI think I\u2019m a guy right now that can help my teammates,\u201d Vescovi said. Collucci said the adjustment for players such as Vescovi is made easier on the next level because of the exposure to that lifestyle they get at the elite level of the academies. \u201cYou become a big brother to these kids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wear a lot of hats, we travel the world with them, they put a lot of trust in us. Santiago walks in to Tennessee in the middle of the year and becomes the starting point guard for a team in the SEC about a week later. The prior year we didn\u2019t know if he was going to land at a college. He was in programs in Italy and Australia playing against top competition prior to Tennessee. That helped him adapt in college, because all of this happened in span of nine months. It wasn\u2019t foreign to him.\u201d Players such as Vescovi, Junior Joseph and Tchatchoua will essentially become ambassadors for the academies. Their stories will be told during the NCAA Tournament, which gets high exposure \u2014 and that\u2019s not lost on Ebersole and Collucci. It can only have a positive trickle-down effect to those already in the academies. \u201cNow there\u2019s a path and trail that\u2019s been blazed by kids who have gone before them,\u201d Collucci said. \u201cThe numbers will increase, the exposure to the program will be greater, so kids in these regions now will know about our programs.\u201d A steady increase in numbers at the grassroots level will increase the odds of finding elite players at the academies, some of whom could eventually find their way to the NBA. While those who run the academies are certainly pleased by the number of campers who get college scholarships, the ultimate goal when the program began was to generate future pros. \u201cWe were always pleasantly surprised how quickly we were able to get the programs off and running,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cThe fact we\u2019ve had some success early on speaks to that foundation of already having this pipeline and groundswell of youth participation from programs like BWB and Jr. NBA. There was actually quicker wins and successes that we expected. Like any new program there\u2019s always bumps in the road but for the most part we\u2019re pleased. \u201cIn certain countries basketball isn\u2019t on the same level as, say, cricket in India. Most countries in Africa, soccer is the leading sport although basketball is growing quickly. Overall we\u2019ve been surprised by the enthusiasm and overall numbers of kids who are playing. The NBA is reaching tens of millions of kids. We always want to keep those numbers growing and the popularity of the sport.\u201d The placement of players in March Madness can only generate more interest in the tournament in places where kids will place a higher priority on playing basketball. That\u2019s the purpose, anyway. \u201cOne of the cool things of the academy program is it\u2019s developing the ambassadors who are going to inspire the future participants,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle that feeds itself. Those who make it at the top are inspiring the next wave.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In a suitcase that\u2019s now well worn, he packed sneakers, a basketball and hope, and needed all three, not necessarily in that order. Three years later, the shoes famously changed brands, the basketball is getting delivered to teammates with a slick flick of the wrist and the hope is beating loudly here in what can be classified as the most sensational NBA rookie season of any in 2020-21. He\u2019s bringing all that back Thursday in his return to Los Angeles, where he\u2019ll play against the team of his boyhood dreams, where he\u2019ll be showcased once more to a once-skeptical basketball audience that is now fully believing the hype. It seems we\u2019ve known about LaMelo for 20 years even though he\u2019s just 19. That\u2019s what the social media age can do \u2014 along with a boisterous father who\u2019s addicted to family promotion \u2014 and when you mix in an NBA-or-bust journey by a high school kid that traveled through three countries and would deter the faint of heart, it explains everything. Above all, LaMelo seems built for what he\u2019s doing already for the Hornets: Playing entertaining basketball, showing unteachable court sense, proving unshakable in tense moments of games and turning a historically-ho-hum franchise into must-watch TV, which might be the most remarkable rabbit-out-of-the-hat of all. Seriously: Aside from LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, who\u2019ll host LaMelo in his homecoming at Staples Center, there might be only five or six teams that attract more curiosity than the Hornets. It\u2019s mainly because of LaMelo, who\u2019s averaging roughly 16 points, six rebounds and six assists in just 28.7 minutes per game. He leads all rookies in assists as well as steals (1.6). Although built like a 6-iron, his height (6-foot-6) often catches opponents and observers off guard and, aided by a quick-jump, enables him to play bigger than he appears around the rim. There is also unexpected praise for his shooting: LaMelo brings a quirky push-release \u2014 apparently it runs in the family \u2014 yet his efficiency is an impressive 37.7% from deep and 45% overall. The real talent is passing and command of the floor. Only a blessed few players bring a special sense of anticipation, for where their teammates are headed, for where the defense lurks. LaMelo has the guts and dexterity to throw behind-the-back passes while running almost full speed, and a knack for tossing soft lobs that catch leaping teammates at the precise time. He\u2019s already comfortable at spotting the angles and knowing the width of passing lanes, the tools that allow for playmaking and creativity. \u201cGrowing up, with my pops having me play up (in age), I could always see passing lanes and certain stuff that I always saw at a young age,\u201d Ball explained. There are good players, and then there are good players who bring box office. LaMelo leans toward the latter and is just getting started. Speaking of that: His start as a basketball professional required a GPS. After his sophomore year he left Chino Hills \u2014 where he and his brothers helped the local high school go undefeated and win the California state championship in 2016 \u2014 because his father became embroiled in a disagreement with the coach. It was probably well and good. LaVar Ball had big and bolder plans for the boys and their future. LaMelo, the youngest, became the main test tube baby when Lonzo left for college and the NBA while LiAngelo fell through the basketball cracks. After leaving the L.A. suburbs, LaMelo played professionally in Lithuania, then rerouted back to the States to finish his high school career at an academy in Ohio, then boomeranged back to pro ball in Australia and closed the door on college basketball. While his blueprint raised eyebrows here and isn\u2019t the norm for teenaged players, it\u2019s rather typical of young elite teens in Europe. Luka Doncic was raised in a basketball academy , signed his first contract at 13, left home shortly thereafter and made his pro debut at 16. Those formative years playing against men is largely credited for Doncic being so skilled and wise to the nuances of the game in the NBA. LaMelo therefore was prepared similarly. When he left for Australia, he was on his own, away from family, accompanied only by his current business manager and mentor, Jermaine Jackson, a former college player who coached him in Ohio. \u201cI was just enjoying life,\u201d LaMelo said of those globetrotting adventures. Once he arrived in the NBA, as the third overall pick , the Hornets suspected almost immediately that LaMelo was possibly ahead of the curve compared to others taken in last summer\u2019s Draft. Gordon Hayward said : \u201cYou could tell in training camp, just in the way he handled himself and knew the game. He blended in and looked like he belonged.\u201d Michael Jordan, the team owner, mentioned recently how LaMelo \u201chas exceeded our expectations\u201d and is obviously thrilled, given the Hornets\u2019 checkered Draft history. Speaking of Jordan: LaMelo claims to have watched Jordan while growing up, which would be tricky since LaMelo was born in 2001 and Jordan retired in 2003. Anyway, the generation gap isn\u2019t so massive, because LaMelo says \u201cI call him my unc\u201d and often picks His Airness\u2019 brain for advice on basketball and other matters. The Hornets brought LaMelo along slowly, spoon-feeding him minutes initially and bringing him off the bench for the first several weeks. When his production in those minutes soon became obvious and also key to the Hornets winning games \u2014 they\u2019re right in the thick of the playoff race in the East \u2014 LaMelo could no longer be denied a meatier role. He\u2019s now treated with great affection by the highlight shows on networks, cable and the internet, which again isn\u2019t foreign to him, given his background and place in the spotlight, thanks partially to his father. This time, though, the attention is deserved and demanded for a rookie who has hit the ground running (and passing) without a stumble yet. \u201cI just came in with the mindset that I would work hard and try to be a better me,\u201d he said. Soft spoken and careful in interviews, LaMelo said: \u201cI feel like I learn day by day, game by game, practice by practice. I feel like every day you can take that as a learning school and just learn something from the day. Even if it\u2019s something big or something very small, I feel like you\u2019re always learning.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t moved by the upcoming first-meeting with LeBron, who was LaVar\u2019s favorite player before his sons reached the NBA. \u201cI mean, nah,\u201d Ball said. \u201cI grew up a little different. Not really on basketball like that. So, not really.\u201d He added that his idol was his father, not any current or former player, and therefore said: \u201cI was big on family \u2026 I go to every game with the same approach \u2014 going in to try to get a win.\u201d That said, LaMelo has adopted one of Carmelo Anthony\u2019s trademarks \u2014 poking his head after making a big shot \u2014 and exchanged jerseys with Anthony when the two met for the first time, so there is a degree of admiration for some influential stars, which is common among rookies. Maybe the best feeling for LaMelo is one of stability. There\u2019s a 99.9% chance that he will not change cities, teams and countries next season \u2014 assuming Jordan doesn\u2019t come down with a bout of craziness and, let\u2019s say, trades the franchise\u2019s meal ticket. So, it\u2019s safe, then, to buy instead of rent. After hopping around globally in search of a good game and some seasoning, teenaged LaMelo Ball finally has a home, and it\u2019s the one he always craved, the one his father always told anyone who would listen: The NBA. \u201cI thought about that after I left Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of not knowing, I now know where I\u2019ll be. That was big.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Ariza, a 16-year NBA veteran, was originally acquired by the Thunder in November. He never suited up for Oklahoma City and last played on March 10, 2020 for the Portland Trail Blazers. The Thunder have no plans to keep Leonard, and may either trade him in the coming days or simply elect to not pick up his $10.2 million option for next season. \u201cLeonard will not be reporting to Oklahoma City and will not be an active member of the organization,\u201d the team said in a statement. Leonard needed to sign off on the trade because of his contract status and did so quickly, according to a person who was familiar with the negotiations leading up to the swap being finalized. He had been away from the Heat for more than a week after a video surfaced of him using the slur. He apologized for the incident, which was roundly criticized by the Heat, Jewish groups, other athletes and celebrities. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined Leonard $50,000 and barred him from being around the Heat for one week. The team had previously said Leonard would be away from the team indefinitely. Silver has said that he believes Leonard \u201cis genuinely remorseful\u201d for using the slur. \u201cMeyers Leonard\u2019s comment was inexcusable and hurtful and such an offensive term has no place in the NBA or in our society,\u201d Silver said last week. Leonard\u2019s mandate from the league to participate in a cultural diversity program will remain in place. He has already met with representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish organization that works to stop extremism and delivers anti-bias education. The second-round pick the Thunder will get is to be conveyed in 2027, and gives Oklahoma City \u2014 which has collected more than 30 picks to use over the next seven years through various other trades \u2014 four second-rounders in that year\u2019s draft alone. Marc Stein of The New York Times  reports that once Ariza makes his way to Miami, shedding Leonard\u2019s salary will help Miami be a stronger contender in the market for San Antonio Spurs big man LaMarcus Aldridge. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich announced last week the team and Aldridge have mutually agreed to work on opportunities elsewhere . The Heat will get to add wing depth for the second consecutive season through a trade for a player who had been sitting out for months. They did it last year as part of a trade with Memphis that brought Andre Iguodala to Miami, and now do it with Ariza \u2014 who was part of three trades in a six-day span this past November and ended up with Oklahoma City, though has never played for the Thunder. The 35-year-old Ariza was born in Miami, has been working out in Miami of late and is about to make the Heat the 10th team that he has played for in 17 seasons \u2014 not even including Detroit and Oklahoma City, two of the teams that acquired him in those trades late last year. He most recently played for Portland, starting 21 games and averaging 11 points for the Trail Blazers last season.

Tucker to Bucks","content":"P.J. Tucker and the Houston Rockets decided last week it was time to move on , and Wednesday found a solution for their collective impasse. Houston sent Tucker and Rodions Kurucs to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday for D.J. Augustin, D.J. Wilson and the Bucks\u2019 first-round pick in 2023. Houston also received the right to swap their 2021 second-round pick for Milwaukee\u2019s 2021 second-round pick. Aside from getting Tucker and Kurucs, Milwaukee also re-acquired their 2022 first-round pick from Houston, which it had obtained from Cleveland via a four-team trade earlier this season. The news was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed by  several others . Shortly after the deal was made official, the Bucks posted video of Tucker\u2019s arrival in Milwaukee. \u201cP.J. Tucker checks all the boxes,\u201d said Bucks GM Jon Horst said in a statement Friday. \u201cHe is a great teammate who brings a veteran presence with playoff experience. P.J.\u2019s a versatile, high-IQ defender, and on the offensive end he plays with discipline, is unselfish, and spaces the court with his ability to knock down the three. \u201cRodions is a talented, young player we feel will benefit from Coach Bud\u2019s system that emphasizes player development and building good habits. Both players are highly competitive, and we welcome them to our family.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 next game is March 20, when they will host the San Antonio Spurs ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ). After a modest 12-8 start to the season, Milwaukee has gone 14-6 and has been one of the best teams in the NBA since Feb. 1. Tucker is averaging 4.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 30 minutes per game this season. He\u2019s struggling with his shot, firing away at career-low clips of 31.4% from 3-point range and 36.6% overall. Kurucs was shipped to Houston by Brooklyn earlier this season as a part of the James Harden mega-trade . He has played in 16 games this season and is averaging career-lows in virtually every major statistic. In a separate move earlier in the week, the Bucks sent forward Torrey Craig to Phoenix for cash considerations.

Bradley, the 7\u20196\u201d former NBA player with the Dallas Mavericks, was struck from behind by an automobile while riding his bicycle a mere block from his home in St. George, Utah. The accident caused a traumatic spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed. After undergoing neck fusion surgery, Bradley has spent the last eight weeks hospitalized and undergoing rehabilitation. Bradley, a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, spent two years performing missionary work in Australia after his freshman year at Brigham Young University. Following his mission, Bradley was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as the number two pick in the 1993 NBA Draft, but he spent the majority of his career with the Dallas Mavericks. His very strong sense of faith is being tested as he participates in grueling physical therapy and learns how to cope with the challenges of paraplegia. Doctors have advised him that his road to recovery will be both long and arduous, perhaps an even more difficult physical challenge than playing professional basketball. With his wife Carrie at his side around the clock, and supported by an amazing team of rehabilitation specialists and family, Bradley is in good spirits. He plans to use his accident as a platform to bring greater public awareness to the importance of bicycle safety. Bradley asked to convey his deep appreciation for the outpouring of well wishes and prayers he has received from family, friends and fans. Their support has energized his recovery and bolstered his confidence that he will manage the long process ahead successfully. He does not plan to issue further public updates, preferring to devote his full concentration on his rehabilitation. Mark Cuban: \u201cWe are saddened to hear of Shawn\u2019s accident. Shawn has always been incredibly determined and shown a fighting spirit. We wish him nothing but the best in his recovery. He will always be a part of our Mavs family.\u201d Donnie Nelson: \u201cWe are deeply saddened to hear of Shawn\u2019s injury and our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family. In his eight-plus seasons in Dallas, Shawn demonstrated all of the qualities you want in a person representing your organization. He has always exhibited unwavering grit and determination and we are thinking of him at this difficult time. He is a Maverick for life.\u201d"},{"id":513649,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-wednesday-march-17-2021","date":"2021-03-17","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Wednesday, March 17, 2021","content":"Bucks (25-14) at Sixers (28-12)  7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 This is a matchup of the second-ranked offense in the league (Milwaukee, 117.3 offensive rating) against the second-ranked defense in the league (Philadelphia, 107.8 defensive rating). \u2022 The Sixers enter Wednesday riding a six-game win streak. During the streak , Tobias Harris has averaged 22.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists, while shooting 54.2% from the field, 42.9% on 3-pointers and 89.5% on free throws while playing in five of the six games. \u2022 The Bucks are on a win streak of their own as they have won four straight games entering Wednesday. Giannis Antetokounmpo has tallied a triple-double in each of the past three games \u2013 the longest such streak in Bucks history. In those three games, Giannis is averaging 29.3 points, 12.0 rebounds and 10.3 assists in 33.8 minutes per game. \u2022 The Sixers (16.4 ppg) and Bucks (15.7 ppg) rank first and third, respectively, in fast break points this season. The Bucks are led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who averages a league-high 5.2 fast break points per game. The Sixers are led by Ben Simmons at 4.0 fast break points per game, which ranks fifth in the league. \u2022 The Sixers are 18-3 at home this season, the second-best home record in the league behind Utah\u2019s 16-2. Philadelphia is better on both sides of the ball at home as their offensive rating is 2.6 points higher and their defensive rating is 2.0 points lower at home compared to the road . The Sixers\u2019 assist percentage is nearly seven points higher at home (59.3%) than the road (52.8%) and their effective field goal percentage is nearly four points higher at home (56.1%) than on the road (52.3%). Clippers (26-15) at Mavericks (20-18)  9:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 The Clippers defeated the Mavericks 109-99 on Monday to even the season series at 1-1 . Kawhi Leonard led seven Clippers in double figures with 22 points in the win, while Luka Doncic recorded his ninth triple-double (25 pts, 16 ast, 10 reb) of the season in the loss. \u2022 The Clippers forced Luka Doncic to take 23 shots to get his 25 points on Monday. Paul George (2:32) and Kawhi Leonard (2:22) split the task as being the primary defender on Doncic , with Kawhi holding Luka to two points on 0-3 shooting from the field and 2-2 from the free throw line and George allowing four points on 2-3 shooting. \u2022 Luka Doncic ranks seventh in the league in scoring at 28.1 points per game; he scores over half of his points from 2-point range (50.8%), including 41.7% of his total points coming in the paint. 88.4% of his 2-point field goals are unassisted, which is the third-highest percentage in the league among players who have played at least 30 games this season. \u2022 The Clippers continue to dominate the perimeter both offensively and defensively. They\u2019re hitting 41.8% of their shots from beyond the arc (1st in the NBA), making 14.5 3-pointers per game (6th in the league). The Clippers also hold teams to 36.2% shooting from 3-point range on 32.5 attempts per game, placing them 9th and 7th in the league, respectively, for fewest allowed. \u2022 This game features three of the top 15 scorers on catch-and-shoots : Dallas\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis (8th, 7.7 ppg, 53.3 eFG%) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (12th, 6.9 ppg, 60.5 eFG%) and LA\u2019s Marcus Morris Sr. (15th, 6.4 ppg, 70.4 eFG%).

Sure, his $9,500 salary cap hit remains high. That\u2019s fine. He hit 5x value against it the last time he took the court, and Sacramento\u2019s awful defense paves the way for him to go off again. They give up the third-most FanDuel points per game (FDPPG) to shooting guards. Richaun Holmes (SAC) $6,900 If you follow the man Zak Hanshew on Twitter, you would\u2019ve fired up Holmes on Monday for his monster 61-FD point showing. I don\u2019t usually like chasing points, but the Wizards give up the most FDPPG to centers, and the loss of Bagley frees up Holmes to get more usage. He could have another high-ceiling game again tonight. Kevin Porter Jr. (HOU) $6,300 Porter Jr. is another player that Hanshew has been recommending (and he\u2019s been doing so since KPJ was literally still in the G League), and with Houston\u2019s depleted roster, he should be a valuable asset again tonight. He did play 41 minutes in the front half of Houston\u2019s back-to-back, but with Oladipo likely out, he makes a safe target anyway. Christian Wood\u2019s potential return could mess with the value of other guys like Jae\u2019Sean Tate, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve left the other Rockets off this list. If Wood continues to sit, the team\u2019s other reserves-turned-starters should have value. Jakob Poeltl (SAS) $5,600 Poeltl had a double-double his last time out, and he\u2019ll have an even easier opponent tonight in the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls give up the sixth-most FDPPG to centers, and they just allowed Moses Brown to go off for 20 points and 16 rebounds last night. Look for Poeltl to capitalize on the poor matchup and hit 5x value tonight. Rui Hachimura (WAS) $5,000 Hachimura spends his minutes between two positions: power forward, where the Kings just lost Bagley, and small forward, to which the Kings give up the seventh-most FDPPG. He should get a lot of run in tonight\u2019s high-scoring battle, and he has hit 5x value against this price in both of his most recent outings. Nemanja Bjelica (SAC) $4,500 With Bagley out, Bjelica is in line for lots of extra run. He averaged 12 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists across Bagley\u2019s two earlier absences. While I\u2019m a little concerned that he didn\u2019t see more usage when Bagley got hurt against the Hornets, I suspect that he\u2019ll get more run tonight. The Wizards field a mid-pack defense against the position, but that may not matter if this turns into a barnburner. Daniel Theis (BOS) $4,400 Theis\u2019 salary has crashed due to his decreasing role, but with Tristan Thompson sidelined, he should see plenty of run for now. He even double-doubled in 26 minutes against the Jazz last night. He has an easier task ahead of him tonight, as the Cavaliers surrender the seventh-most FDPPG to power forwards and rank around the league average against centers. Caris LeVert (IND) $4,400 Uh\u2026 why is LeVert\u2019s salary still so low? The man has played 25-plus minutes in both of his games for the Pacers, turning them into 20.4 (4.6x value) and 30.4 FD points (6.9x value), respectively. He\u2019ll play his old team, the Nets, tonight, and they give up the sixth-most points per game to shooting guards. LeVert should be chalk tonight, but he is good chalk. Tomas Satoransky (CHI) $3,900 Satoransky has made back-to-back starts for the Bulls, and he is averaging 33.3 FDPPG (8.5x value) through those appearances. That\u2019s a phenomenal value at this salary! The Bulls are expected to leave him in their starting lineup over Coby White, so keep riding him at this incredibly low-end price point. James Wiseman (GSW) $3,800 I\u2019ll end with one somewhat risky play. If Wood suits up, don\u2019t use Wiseman. However, if he doesn\u2019t, Wiseman is a fantastic, low-risk asset at this price. The Rockets give up the ninth-most FDPPG to centers, and Danilo Gallinari just throttled them for 29 points and six rebounds from the five last night."},{"id":513555,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-rookie-ladder-march-17-edition","date":"2021-03-17","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Anthony Edwards showing why Minnesota selected him No. 1 overall","content":"Anthony Edwards ought to like his climb up the Kia Rookie Ladder this week, even if he doesn\u2019t like the topic we\u2019re going to discuss. The Timberwolves\u2019 young potential star and the No. 1 overall pick in November\u2019s 2020 Draft apparently grew weary of the chatter he heard and even questions he faced through the season\u2019s first half about his Draft position relative to Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball. Ball has been the consensus favorite for most of the season after being drafted No. 3 overall behind both Edwards and Golden State\u2019s James Wiseman. \u201cWhoever is still talking about that, they can just kick rocks,\u201d Edwards told reporters Sunday, after scoring 34 points against Portland. What the rookie from Georgia should realize is that anyone reviving what was looking like a closed case is doing so because he\u2019s forcing the issue. With performances quite befitting a No. 1 overall pick. Edwards\u2019 season-long traditional stats are solid enough \u2014 15.8 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game \u2014 but some flaws in shooting (38.1% overall, 31.5% on 3-pointers) and decision-making had weighed against them. Defensively, as you\u2019d expect with most rookies, he had lots to learn. And of course Minnesota was losing at a miserable rate \u2014 9-31 now \u2014 with injuries, Malik Beasley\u2019s suspension and a coaching firing thrown in. Lately, though, Edwards has found a groove. In five games prior to Tuesday, he averaged 25 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.0 steals. And as veteran Wolves radio play-by-play announcer Alan Horton found , Edwards was answering critics by driving to the basket. He was in the company of some big-time interior scoring threats with 26 buckets from the restricted area in those five games. Then he got 29 points and sank four of his six 3-pointers against the Lakers in L.A. Tuesday. Quickly, the conversation is changing from what Edwards doesn\u2019t do to what he does, and skipping some of the second-guessing about his Draft position. Veteran Wolves point guard Ricky Rubio, who mostly has been dour about his team\u2019s season, perks up when Edwards gets discussed. \u201cIf you put together all that\u2019s going on with COVID, changing of coaching, everything,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cI think it\u2019s the toughest rookie season for any rookie that I\u2019ve been a part of, especially for a No. 1 pick. \u2026 I just try to keep him engaged and not lost, deal with the big picture.\u201d Edwards\u2019 personality has mostly stayed buoyant through the tough lessons. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, every game and every situation seems like it\u2019s the end of the world sometimes when it\u2019s not working,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut his character is special. I said it from Day 1, I think we have a gem here.\u201d Teammate Karl-Anthony Towns, the No. 1 pick in 2015, flat-out said it, that drafting Edwards was the \u201cright decision.\u201d Now, Towns happens to play the same position as Wiseman and is buddies with D\u2019Angelo Russell, who plays the same position as Ball. Edwards slipped more comfortably into Minnesota\u2019s depth chart. And there undoubtedly is some confirmation bias at work here among the Wolves and their fans \u2013 it\u2019s not like anyone gets a mulligan or a do-over for Draft night. But Edwards still has time to create some drama in the Kia Rookie of the Year race. And even if he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s worth noting some of the NBA\u2019s young stars who did not win that award, such as Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid, Jamal Murry and Nikola Jokic. Other No. 1 picks have gone on to thrive, too, without that particular trophy in their bag, including Williamson, John Wall and, way back when, a fellow named Earvin Johnson (Larry Bird snagged the ROY). The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, March 15) Season stats : 15.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.3 apg Since last Ladder: 15.3 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 1 Nobody in the Class of 2020 has narrowed the gap between himself and Ball so far in the Rookie of the Year race. While the folks at the Elias Sports Bureau got a bit overexuberant in their stat-mining on him (steals were only made an official NBA stat 48 years ago), they\u2019re probably right anyway and certainly in spirit. Ball\u2019s grasp of the game and flair have made him the cornerstone of coach James Borrego\u2019s offense. Ball didn\u2019t start for the Hornets\u2019 first 20 games, but it\u2019s unthinkable that he\u2019d be out of the starting lineup on his or any teammates\u2019 merit going forward. He\u2019s so much more than scoring, but there is this: Ball has a 60.8 true-shooting percentage when he plays at least 30 minutes, compared to 50.2 when he doesn\u2019t. Season stats : 15.8 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.5 apg Since last Ladder: 27.3 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 2.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 3 When Edwards scored 34 points to help beat the Blazers Sunday at Target Center, he took over top position for all Wolves teenagers (Kevin Garnett, Stephon Marbury and Andrew Wiggins each managed 33 in a game before turning 20). He impressed a couple of critics with some work on defense and in his shooting form too. And since the Wolves actually won that game, a fan on Twitter \u2013 referring to Edwards\u2019 spectacular, poster-worthy slams that seemed to some like empty calories as his team lost and he played inefficiently \u2013 had a question: \u201cIs it OK to enjoy his dunks now because they won?\u201d Season stats : 12.8 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.4 apg Since last Ladder: 19.0 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 2 Challenging week for the Knicks newbie, getting the first two starts of his young career, being tested by Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving and James Harden, scoring 21 that night, tweaking an ankle Tuesday at Philadelphia and missing a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 11 seconds left. Quickley didn\u2019t like missing that on a 1-for-5 night from the arc, though he said he was confident in taking the clutch attempt. The No. 25 pick is carrying some added load as the Knicks patch together their point guard spot. Season stats : 12.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 5.2 apg Since last Ladder: 5.7 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 4 A minutes restriction in his return from a calf injury that cost him four games had Haliburton out of rhythm and, by his own words, playing \u201cawful.\u201d \u201cI was playing really well before I got hurt,\u201d he said after Sacramento\u2019s loss to Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to get it back, but I\u2019m playing really bad right now.\u201d He shot 7-for-23, including 3-for-11 on 3-pointers, in his first three games back. But his minutes are headed up, so some rust should flake off. Season stats : 11.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 0.6 apg Since last Ladder: 12.3 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 0.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 7 Even as Wiseman was benched for missing a COVID test and subsequent practice, coach Steve Kerr was promising we\u2019d see more minutes for the No. 2 pick. And we did, with Wiseman responding well and showing solid progress against top competitors the Jazz and Lakers (a combined 23 points and 12 rebounds on 11-of-18 shooting in 51 minutes). The Warriors believe they see the lessons on and off the floor sinking in for the 7-footer. 6. Saddiq Bey, Detroit Pistons Season stats : 10.0 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.1 apg Since last Ladder: 11.3 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 0.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 5 His 79 3FG in his first 37 games ranked as 5th most in NBA history. 7.

So, we\u2019re already fantasizing about some of the potential matchups on the horizon. Before going there, though, here\u2019s a FAQ on the Play-In Tournament. It is set to take place during the window after the conclusion of the regular season and just before the opening round of the playoffs involving the teams finishing seventh through 10th in their respective conferences. (The dates to mark on the calendar are May 18-21, FYI.) Basically, the teams finishing the season seventh and eighth in both conferences will receive two shots at winning one game to advance to the postseason, while the teams sitting at ninth and 10th will need to win two consecutive outings to earn a playoff berth. So, once the regular season ends, the teams in both conferences with the seventh-highest winning percentages will host the squads finishing at eighth in their conferences in a play-in game, with the winner of those contests taking the seventh seeds in the East and the West. For the teams finishing ninth and 10th in their conferences, the format is virtually the same as above. The ninth-place teams will host the clubs with the 10th-highest winning percentages in their conferences. The winners of those contests will advance to play the losers of the games involving the seventh and eighth seeds on the road, with the victors of those outings taking the eighth seeds in the postseason for their respective conferences. In the Eastern Conference, the 11th place Toronto Raptors are currently just two games behind the eighth-place New York Knicks. You see a little more separation in the West, where the New Orleans Pelicans and Oklahoma City Thunder \u2014 tied at 11th \u2014 are four games back of the eighth-place Dallas Mavericks. The seventh and 10th spots in the West are separated by just three games. There\u2019s still plenty of basketball left to play. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from taking a quick look at five potential matchups for the upcoming Play-In Tournament that we think would serve as a perfect appetizer for postseason NBA action: Everything\u2019s big in Texas, they say. This won\u2019t be any different with a pair of the league\u2019s best, not to mention longest-tenured, coaches in Gregg Popovich and Rick Carlisle matching wits for a berth in the playoffs. On the surface, the Mavericks appear to hold the advantage here since they\u2019re led by a transcendent star in Luka Doncic, not to mention they\u2019ve already beaten the Spurs twice so far this season. In fact, since the 2019-20 season, Dallas is 5-1 against San Antonio. But the playoffs are a different story, which is where Popovich\u2019s greatness could come into play. These teams haven\u2019t met in the postseason since 2014, when the Spurs knocked off Dallas 4-3 in the opening round. The way the Hornets and Hawks are rolling, we might not get a chance to see this matchup. But hey, we can dream, right? Could you imagine young Atlanta star Trae Young and rookie sensation LaMelo Ball going at one another in a playoff atmosphere? From what we\u2019ve seen so far, you can bet Ball won\u2019t be scared. Charlotte beat Atlanta during a pair of matchups in January, including one in which Ball became the youngest player in league history to post a triple-double (22 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists). Pay attention to the April 11 matchup between these teams because it could serve as a potential Play-In Tournament preview. First off, shout-out to first-time All-Stars Zach LaVine and Julius Randle. Both players lead historic franchises that are fighting to make it back into the postseason. You can expect a major scrap between the teams if this matchup somehow materializes, especially when you consider the fact these clubs haven\u2019t clashed in the postseason since 1996. This isn\u2019t exactly the playoffs, but it\u2019s close enough. The storyline of Knicks guard Derrick Rose, a Chicago native, facing the team that drafted him No. 1 overall in 2008 adds an extra level of intrigue. Both teams haven\u2019t been in the same playoffs since 2013. Popovich and Steve Kerr sound great as a future presidential ticket , but there\u2019s some interesting recent history between these franchises. Remember, the Spurs eliminated Golden State in the Western Conference semifinals in 2013, when the Warriors were still learning to win. Then, after San Antonio had captured its fifth title, the Warriors knocked out the Spurs in embarrassing fashion in 2017 and 2018, winning eight of the nine playoff games en route to NBA titles those years. The teams are now vastly different, not to mention younger, with both seeking to return to form as perennial contenders. This one\u2019s easy: Ja Morant vs. Zion Williamson in a matchup featuring the top two picks of the 2019 NBA Draft and the future faces of this league. Morant captured the 2019-20 Kia NBA Rookie of the Year Award, but Memphis hasn\u2019t fared well against New Orleans since both players came into the league. The last time the Grizzlies defeated the Pelicans (Feb. 9, 2019), neither player was in the NBA. New Orleans has beaten Memphis five games in a row, but the stakes with a potential postseason berth hanging in the balance should raise the level of competitiveness. Both of these franchises appear to be in the beginning stages of building something special. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Lillard dropped 50 points on the New Orleans Pelicans as the Blazers climbed from a 17-point hole with six minutes, 53 seconds left to score a 125-124 win that was one of Portland\u2019s most memorable of 2020-21. Here\u2019s a look at the raw, basic stats from Lillard\u2019s performance: The last two free throws Lillard made not only got him to 50 points, but came with 1.2 seconds left that capped Portland\u2019s rally from that 17-point deficit. Lillard scored 20 of his 50 points in the fourth quarter in a performance that will always be memorable to him. \u201cI think with how it happened and the position we were in down the stretch, this will be one I remember,\u201d Lillard said after the win. In logging this latest 50-point performance, Lillard left some memorable marks in the NBA record books as well. First, he had the third fewest field goal attempts in NBA history (per Elias Sports) en route to a 50-point game in the shot-clock era (since 1954-55). Here\u2019s a look: Lillard also moved into a tie with two other players \u2014 one of whom is a Hall of Famer \u2014 among players who have had the most games with 50 or more points and 10 or more assists in the same game: Lastly, this outburst vs. the Pelicans marked the 12th time in Lillard\u2019s career he has crossed the 50-point plateau. That ties him for 7th all-time, which is solid. But keep in mind he needs more than 100 of these games to come close to surpassing the all-time leader, Wilt Chamberlain, for the record: Lillard\u2019s lore continues to grow in the Pacific Northwest, a feat not lost on anyone close to him on a daily basis. \u201cHe continues to do things that are remarkable,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Tuesday night. \u201cFifty points and 10 assists, and game-winners, and all the things that he does. I\u2019m never surprised, but I never take it for granted.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":513258,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-fred-vanvleet-returns-to-practice-details-his-covid-19-experience","date":"2021-03-17","title":"Raptors\u2019 Fred VanVleet practices, details his time with COVID-19","content":"Fred VanVleet has been giving out a lot of hugs lately, for the simple fact that he\u2019s thrilled to know the worst of his COVID-19 experience is now over. For the Toronto Raptors, that news couldn\u2019t come quickly enough. VanVleet and three other Raptors \u2014 Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw \u2014 were back with the team for practice Tuesday, after missing more than two weeks for virus-related reasons. Siakam, Flynn and McCaw are questionable to play Wednesday in Detroit; VanVleet and OG Anunoby are likely to remain out until at least Friday\u2019s home game in Tampa, Florida against Utah. VanVleet revealed that he tested positive for the virus, adding that the symptoms gave him some problems. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here, I\u2019m alive, I\u2019m breathing and I know there\u2019s a lot of people that didn\u2019t make it through COVID. So, my thoughts and my heart are with the families and people that\u2019s been affected by this thing that weren\u2019t as fortunate as I was \u2014 as I am.\u201d Siakam has missed six games, while VanVleet and the other Raptors have missed five. Toronto was also without coach Nick Nurse and some assistants for some of that time; the Raptors won the first game without Nurse, but one game was postponed and the other five all become losses since. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough stretch for everybody, not just the guys that were locked up,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cThe rest of the guys that were trying to put the pieces together, I feel for them.\u201d But the Raptors have had some mini-celebrations in recent days, as players and coaches return to the mix. \u201cActually almost had a whole roster out there tonight,\u201d Nurse said after practice Tuesday. \u201cI was running some 5-on-0 and had to run three teams, believe it or not. Big jump forward.\u201d VanVleet said he was dealing with body aches, a fever and other issues. He also had to separate himself from his family and teammates immediately after testing positive. \u201cAt that point, it was just a matter of trying to get somewhere and get isolated and get away from my kids and my girl and my family,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cI hunkered down. I had it. I had symptoms, a few days of symptoms. It was pretty rough, a few of those days.\u201d The league has had about 100 players test positive this season \u2014 48 of those in the week before the start of training camp \u2014 and has had to reschedule 31 games for virus-related reasons, such as positive tests and contact tracing keeping teams from having enough players to take the floor. Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid could not play in the All-Star Game for a contact tracing issue, and the New Orleans Pelicans had some players and staff get their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine this past weekend. VanVleet learned on Sunday that he would be allowed back in the gym to start conditioning again Monday. He said he couldn\u2019t even sleep Sunday night, in anticipation of finally getting back to work. \u201cI forgot how much I love this (stuff),\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cI really love the game. I really love basketball. I love being in the gym. I don\u2019t always love everything that comes with it, but I really love the game. It\u2019s just a blessing to be able to be back.\u201d"},{"id":513055,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lebron-james-becomes-partner-in-group-that-owns-red-sox","date":"2021-03-17","title":"Reports: LeBron James becomes part owner of Boston Red Sox","content":"LeBron James is becoming a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox. Not only that, but he made it clear he has his sights set on owning a team in the NBA someday, too. A person with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday that James \u2014 the Los Angeles Lakers star \u2014 and his longtime business partner Maverick Carter are now partners in the Fenway Sports Group. The person, who did not reveal the size of the investment made by James or Carter, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because none of the parties involved had announced the moves publicly. Following the Lakers\u2019 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday, James said he wants to own an NBA team someday. \u201cI got so much to give to the game, I know what it takes to win at this level, I know talent and I also know how to run a business as well,\u201d James said, per Reuters . \u201cSo that is my goal. My goal is to own a NBA franchise, and you know it\u2019ll be sooner than later.\u201d The Boston Globe first reported the news, and The New York Times and ESPN also reported that James and Carter were becoming partners. Fenway Sports Group is the parent company of the Red Sox as well as the Liverpool Football Club of the English Premier League and the Roush Fenway Racing NASCAR team. Fenway Sports Group Chairman Tom Werner did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the Red Sox and FSG declined to comment. Per ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan , James already owned 2% of Liverpool and in joining FSG, James and Carter will become the company\u2019s first Black partners. James said he\u2019s excited to be a part of the Red Sox ownership group and particularly that he gets to do so with Carter. \u201cFor me, and for my partner Maverick (Carter), to be the first two black men to be a part of that ownership group, in the history of that franchise, I think it\u2019s pretty damn cool,\u201d James said, per Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty amazing thing and for me to continue to build my portfolio off the floor also in a beautiful game like baseball.\u201d At the 2019 NBA All-Star Game, James told reporters he hoped to own a team. \u201cI believe if I wanted to, I could own a team or be part of a basketball team. I know I got so much knowledge of the game that I don\u2019t want to, once I stop playing \u2014 I just [do not] want to get away from the game.\u201d It is a most unusual relationship in one respect: James has long professed to being a New York Yankees fan, though he has also shown allegiances to the Cleveland Indians and Los Angeles Dodgers in recent years. And now, he\u2019ll be linked to the Red Sox \u2014 the Yankees\u2019 biggest rival. James has had a relationship with FSG since 2011, when he signed a marketing deal in exchange for a small ownership stake in Liverpool. Cleveland Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said James being able to buy into the group is a huge step, especially when considering the example it sets for diversity in business. \u201cI think when you look at him in particular, and his forethought to be able to put himself in position to change generational wealth, has been amazing,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cAnd you look at not only what he\u2019s done for himself but what it allows him to do for other people. It\u2019s something that inspires, something for others to marvel at.\u201d The move only enhances James\u2019 business empire. The four-time NBA champion with Miami, Cleveland and the Lakers is believed to have the NBA\u2019s top endorsement portfolio. He also has the media company Uninterrupted and a production company, SpringHill Entertainment. \u201cYou knew that he has a great eye and passion for business,\u201d Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t set any boundaries on where he can take it. He\u2019s a big Yankees fan, so I think that that makes it fun.\u201d James has spoken often in recent years about his off-court role in society, and how he values that part of his life as much as he does still being one of basketball\u2019s elite players. \u201cI still know what I do on the floor and obviously, I give everything to the game,\u201d James told AP in December. \u201cBut I can make a greater impact off the floor right now, more than I can on the floor. And I want to continue to inspire people with the way I play the game of basketball. But there\u2019s so many more things that I can do off the floor to help cultivate people, inspire people, bring people together, empower them.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":513017,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-tuesday-mar-16","date":"2021-03-16","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Tuesday (Mar. 16)","content":"Kevin Porter Jr: $6,000 vs. ATL My love for Kevin Porter Jr. has been unmatched this season, and I\u2019ve loved watching him shine in his first three games as a Rocket. He\u2019s averaged 17.0 points, 8.3 assists, 3.3 boards and 2.3 combined blocks\/steals since his call up from the G League, and with John Wall and Christian Wood out yet again, expect KPJ to see another heavy-usage performance tonight as he handles point guard duties. Kevin Huerter: $5,700 at HOU Huerter has averaged better than 25 FD points per game this season, and he continues to see plenty of run in Atlanta\u2019s starting lineup. Tonight, he\u2019ll face a Rockets squad that hasn\u2019t been able to stop anyone this season. I\u2019m happy to pay $5.7K for a guy who can heat up quickly from deep. Lauri Markkanen: $5,500 vs. OKC Markkanen has averaged 29 FD points across his last three games while scoring at least 20 real points in two of those contests. He\u2019s a nightly threat for big point totals while chipping in some serviceable numbers on the boards. He\u2019s quite a value at just $5.5K. Dwight Howard: $5,200 vs. NYK Joel Embiid is out, and Howard should continue to see minutes in the low-to-mid 20\u2019s in the interim. Expect some quality production from the veteran big in a favorable matchup against the Knicks. Jaylen Nowell: $4,500 at LAL Is it December already? Not quite, but Nowell (aka \u201cFather Christmas\u201d) should be delivering DFS presents to those who choose to roster him tonight. He\u2019s scored no fewer than 20 FD points in each of his last three, including a 47-point eruption against New Orleans last week. With Malik Beasley still suspended, Nowell should continue to enjoy a prominent offensive role for the Timberwolves, making him a great value on this slate. Aleksej Pokusevski: $4,500 at CHI It\u2019s Poku season around the NBA after Oklahoma City\u2019s young seven-footer went off Sunday to the tune of 23\/10\/4 in his third straight start. The big man can play both forward positions and based on his recent play, he should be a staple in the Thunder\u2019s lineup for the rest of the season. I love him at this price on tonight\u2019s slate. Tomas Satoransky: $4,200 vs. OKC Satoransky drew his first start of the season Sunday and put up 10\/7\/6 with two blocks and a steal in 26 minutes. It\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll remain in the starting five moving forward, but he\u2019s averaged better than 20 minutes per game this season and can still provide meaningful production off the bench. Moses Brown: $4,200 at CHI Al Horford is out again, and Brown could draw his second straight start in a favorable matchup tonight. He\u2019s averaged 24.5 FD points in each of his last three, and it looks like the rebuilding Thunder is giving its young guys some run down the stretch. Brown is a nice tournament pivot away from more expensive and more popular options at center. Kenyon Martin Jr: $3,500 vs. ATL This is one of the most blatant examples of mispricing I\u2019ve ever seen. Martin Jr. has averaged 35.9 FD points across 30 minutes per contest since coming up from the G League three games ago, and again, both Wood and Wall remain out tonight. Martin Jr. is an easy salary-saving option who could return 10x value. Kenrich Williams: $3,500 at CHI Williams had a short run in the starting lineup earlier this season, but in 12 games since returning to the bench, he\u2019s still logging 22 minutes per contest. Williams has carved out a meaningful role in the Thunder\u2019s rotation, and he\u2019s more than capable of returning 6 or 7x value. He\u2019s scored better than 20 FD points in each of his last two games and makes a fine tournament play tonight."},{"id":513012,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-rookie-killian-hayes-hip-cleared-for-on-court-activities","date":"2021-03-16","title":"Pistons rookie Killian Hayes (hip) cleared for on-court activities","content":"The Pistons medical team has evaluated the rehabilitation progress on Killian Hayes\u2019 right hip subluxation and results have shown significant positive improvement and advancement towards recovery.

Kemba Walker was the primary defender on Mitchell for a team-high 5:16 (40.2% of total offensive matchup) and gave up 12 points (33.3% of his points) on 4-6 shooting. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics that game with 33 points, 10 of those (30.3%) coming in 6:46 of matchup time against Joe Ingles (54.3% of his total offensive matchup time). \u2022 Utah leads the NBA in 3-pointers made (16.9 per game) and connects at the third-highest percentage (39.6%). On defense, the Jazz allow the fewest 3-pointers of any team (10.9 per game) and hold opponents to the sixth-lowest 3-point percentage (35.3%). \u2022 The Jazz have gone 5-5 in their last 10 games , giving Utah as many losses in the past 10 games as they had in their first 28 games (23-5). During this 10-game stretch, Utah\u2019s offense has remained on par with its early season success (116.0 last 10 games, 116.6 first 28 games), but the defense has dropped off (110.7 last 10 games, 107.4 first 28 games). \u2022 Boston enters Tuesday with a 12-5 record at home this season. At home, the Celtics rank 10th in both offensive (114.6) and defensive efficiency (109.9).

Lillard also dished out 16 assists in the game. This was only the fifth game since 1983-84 that a player has posted at least 43 points and 16 assists in the same game with Lillard joining James Harden (2x), Trae Young and Isiah Thomas. \u2022 Delivering in clutch situations is something Lillard has become accustomed to throughout his career. He leads the NBA with 114 clutch points this season and is shooting 33-54 (61.1%) from the field, 15-17 (55.6%) from 3-point range and a perfect 33-33 from the free throw line when the game is within five points in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. Since entering the NBA in 2012-13, Lillard has finished outside the top 10 in clutch points only twice in nine seasons (16th his rookie year and 15th in his fourth year). \u2022 Zion Williamson matched his season high with 36 points in the first meeting with Portland on Feb. 17. Zion Williamson won his individual matchup with Robert Covington by scoring 25 points (69.4% of his total) and drawing four shooting fouls during 6:58 of matchup time (64.4% of Zion\u2019s offensive time). \u2022 The Blazers rank second in the league in 3-pointers made (16.2 per game) and eighth in 3-point percentage (38.2%). CJ McCollum, who has been cleared to play on Tuesday , led the NBA with 4.8 3-pointers made per game before he went down to a foot injury after 13 games. Lillard ranks third in the league with 4.3 3-pointers made per game, with Stephen Curry sitting between the Blazers\u2019 sharpshooters. \u2022 Damian Lillard (18 games) and Zion Williamson (17 games) have the second- and third-longest active streaks of 20-point games .

The original team is said to have the \u201cright of first refusal.\u201d Restricted free agency exists in the following situations: There are five basic options for a restricted free agent: Offer sheets When a restricted free agent wants to sign with another team, he and the new team sign an offer sheet. The terms of that deal \u2014 which must be for at least two seasons \u2014 are given to the player\u2019s original team, which has two days to match. If the team matches, then the player is under contract with his original team, but at the principal terms of the offer sheet. If the team passes on matching within two days, the player is under contract with the new team. If the player for some reason refuses to report for a physical with the original team within two days of the match, the first refusal exercise notice is in play until the player reports. The original team also can withdraw its first refusal exercise notice if the player doesn\u2019t report for a physical. At that point, the notice and the offer sheet are invalidated and the player becomes a restricted free agent again. He cannot sign with or be acquired by the offer sheet team for one year. The team making the offer must have enough salary cap room for the offer sheet and must maintain that room until the offer sheet becomes official or the original team exercises the right of first refusal. The original team cannot match an offer greater than its salary cap room. That original team must have room for both the regular salary and any unlikely bonuses the offer sheet includes. Qualifying offers For a player to become a restricted free agent, his team must submit a qualifying offer to the player between the day after the last game of The Finals and June 29. The qualifying offer is a standing offer for a one-year guaranteed deal, which becomes a regular contact if the player decides to sign it. This ensures that the team does not gain the right of first refusal without offering a contract themselves. If a player is coming off a regular (non-Two-Way deal), he may qualify for a higher or lower qualifying offer provided he met (or did not meet) the \u201cstarter criteria\u201d the previous season \u2014 or the average of the previous two seasons. Starter criteria are based on starting at least 41 games or playing at least 2,000 minutes in the regular season. Qualifying offers expire on Oct. 1, but can be extended. However, the extension of a qualifying offer cannot go past March 1. If the deadline passes and the qualifying offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted, the player continues to be a restricted free agent. Teams and players are free to negotiate a new contract after the qualifying offer expires as the deadline only affects the player\u2019s ability to accept his qualifying offer. Players can always accept the qualifying offer and play the following season under its terms. This is sometimes done to ensure unrestricted free agency in the following offseason. Unrestricted Free Agency In short, an unrestricted free agent (UFA) is free to sign with any team. Once they sign, they are a part of that new team. However, some unrestricted free agents have options on their existing contracts that, if exercised, may impact their choices. Free Agency Moratorium The Free Agency Moratorium is a negotiation period from July 1-6 in which teams may not sign most free agents or make trades. Starting at 6:01 p.m. on June 30, teams may negotiate deals with free agents but cannot officially sign them until Noon on July 6. Any deals struck during the moratorium period are characterized as agreements, but do not count toward team salary and are not binding for the player or team. Either side can back out in this situation \u2014 a scenario that took place in 2015 when DeAndre Jordan reneged on his verbal agreement with the Dallas Mavericks to instead re-sign with the then-incumbent LA Clippers. Some signings can take place during the moratorium period, which are: Otherwise, all other signings must wait until after the moratorium period ends. Team Options A team option grants the original team the right to keep a player for another year. If a player has a three-year contract with an option for the fourth season, that means if the option is exercised (by the team in this example), the contract extends through the fourth season. If the option is not exercised (by the team in this example), then the contract ends after the third season. Once an option is exercised it cannot be revoked \u2014 meaning (in this case) the team can\u2019t change their mind of the option once they exercise it. Conditional team options are not allowed, which means the option cannot be contingent on something like number of games played, team wins or scoring average. There can be only one option year (except in the case of rookie-scale contracts). For rookie-scale contracts for first-round picks, those contain a team option before both the third and fourth seasons. Option years cannot have a lower salary than the previous season. Player Options A player option grants the player the power to decide whether to stay for another year or become an unrestricted free agent. If a player has a three-year contract with an option for the fourth season, that means if the option is exercised (by the player in this example), the contract extends through the fourth season. If the option is not exercised (by the player in this example), then the contract ends after the third season. Once an option is exercised it cannot be revoked \u2014 meaning (in this case) the player can\u2019t change their mind of the option once they exercise it. Conditional player options are not allowed, which means the option cannot be contingent on something like number of games played, team wins or scoring average. There can be only one option year (except in the case of rookie-scale contracts). For rookie-scale contracts for first-round picks, those contain a team option before both the third and fourth seasons. Option years cannot have a lower salary than the previous season. Early Termination Options An early termination option gives the player the right to end a signed contract. The option cannot be exercised before the end of the fourth year of an existing contract, which means the contract must be for five seasons. If the player declines to exercise the option, he remains with the original team. If the option is exercised, he becomes an unrestricted free agent and is free to sign with any team. Early termination options are always held by the player (in other words, there are never team early termination options). A contract that has an ETO cannot be extended if the ETO is exercised.

In the 2020-21 season, the All-Star Game was held March 7 in Atlanta and the 2021 trade deadline is on March 25 at 3 p.m. ET. January 1947 Trade deadline extended, from January 1 to midnight January 20 January 1949 Trade deadline extended to February 10 February 1965 No trades or sales among NBA teams are permitted after midnight, February 1 June 1978 Trade deadline changed from February 1 to February 15 April 1987 Trade deadline changed to 9 p.m. ET on the 16th Thursday of the season May 1999 Trade deadline changed to 6 p.m. ET on the 17th Thursday of the season 2002 Trade deadline time changed to 3 p.m. ET July 2017 Trade deadline moved from Thursday after the NBA All-Star Game to Thursday 10 days prior to the All-Star Game ** VIEW EVERY DEADLINE DEAL SINCE 1987 ** Editor\u2019s note: Settle in, because this one is complicated. For one year following the date of the trade of a player contract to another team, a team may replace that traded player with one or more players acquired by assignment. There are rules pertaining to non-simultaneous and simultaneous trades, which are as follows: \u2022 For a \u201cnon-taxpaying\u201d team , a traded player may be simultaneously (i.e., in the same transaction) replaced by one or more players acquired by assignment whose salaries in the aggregate do not exceed the greater of (i) the lesser of (A) 175% of the salaries of the players being traded plus $100,000, or (B) the salaries of the players being traded plus $5 million, or (ii) 125% of the salaries of the players being traded plus $100,000. \u2022 For a \u201ctaxpaying\u201d team , a traded player may be simultaneously replaced by one or more players acquired by assignment whose salaries in the aggregate do not exceed 125% of the salaries of the players being traded plus $100,000. \u2022 A traded player may be replaced in a non-simultaneous transaction by one or more players acquired by assignment whose salaries in the aggregate do not exceed 100% of the salary of the player being traded, plus $100,000. \u2022 A team below the Salary Cap may simultaneously acquire one or more players by assignment whose post-trade salaries, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the team\u2019s salary cap room plus $100,000. \u2022 In certain circumstances in connection with sign-and-trade transactions , the player traded will not generate the Traded Player Exception amounts described above. Specifically, if a team that is over the Salary Cap enters into a sign-and-trade contract with a Bird or Early Bird free agent using the Bird or Early Bird Exception, and the salary in the first year of the contract is in excess of 120% of the player\u2019s salary in the prior season, then for purposes of calculating the assignor team\u2019s Traded Player Exception, the player\u2019s salary will be deemed equal to the greater of the salary for the last season of his prior contract or 50% of the first year salary under the sign-and-trade contract. \u2022 For contracts entered into or extended beginning with the 2017-18 season (but in the case of extensions, only with respect to the extended term): (i) in circumstances where a player\u2019s salary protection is less than full , Traded Player Exceptions arising from the trade of such contracts will be calculated based upon the amount of the player\u2019s protected salary in the applicable season (rather than the sum of the player\u2019s protected and unprotected salary); (ii) with respect to trades conducted following the last day of a regular season, Traded Player Exceptions will be limited to the amount of the player\u2019s protected salary for the following Salary Cap Year (rather than the current Salary Cap Year). MORE ON EXCEPTIONS Exceptions cannot be added together to sign or acquire a player, except that a team may aggregate two or more Traded Player Exceptions for the purpose of acquiring \u2014 in the same transaction \u2014 one or more replacement players. Teams that are trading two more more players may elect to apply the exception separately to each of the players it is trading (or where permitted by the CBA) to aggregate the salaries of multiple players it is trading and then apply the exception. ** FULL CBA EXPLANATION FOR ALL CONTRACT EXCEPTION RULES ** SIGN-AND-TRADES Teams are prohibited from signing a free agent pursuant to an agreement that the player will later be traded to another team unless the free agent being signed is the team\u2019s own free agent. In addition, these \u201csign-and-trades\u201d are permitted only if : (i) the contract is for three or four years, (ii) the first year of the contract is fully guaranteed, (iii) the contract is entered into prior to the first day of the regular season, (iv) the player finished the prior season on the signing team\u2019s roster. NOTE: The maximum annual salary increase for a sign-and-trade is 5% of the salary in the first year of the contract. After a sign-and-trade deal, the signing team will be \u201chard-capped\u201d at the total of the then-current Salary Cap Year plus the Tax Apron Amount. EXTENSION-AND-TRADES \u2022 Max Length: 3 years (including year(s) remaining in the original term) \u2022 Max First-Year Salary: 105% of the salary in the last year of the original term. \u2022 Max Annual Increase: 5% of the salary in the first year of the extended term. If a player signs a contract extension for a longer period, a higher amount, or higher annual increases than would be permitted for an extension-and-trade, then the team is prohibited from trading the player for a period of six months following the date of the extension. If a team acquires a player in a trade, then for a period of six months following the date of the trade, the team is prohibited from signing the player to a contract extension for a longer period, higher amount, or higher annual increases than would have been permitted for an extension-and-trade. CASH TRANSFERS For the 2018-19 Salary Cap Year, teams could send or receive up to an aggregate $5.243 million, in trades. Cash sent is not netted against cash received, and vice-versa. This maximum annual cash limit in trades increases or decreases annually at the same rate as the Salary Cap. ONE-YEAR CONTRACTS A player who signs a one-year contract \u2014 excluding any option year \u2014 and who will be a Bird or Early Bird free agent at the end of the contract cannot be traded without the player\u2019s consent. If the player consents and is traded, he will lose whatever \u201cBird\u201d rights he has acquired (i.e., he will be considered to have moved to the new team as a free agent.) WAITING PERIOD FOR NEW CONTRACTS A draft rookie who signs a standard NBA player contract or any player who signs a Two-Way Contract may not be traded until 30 days following the date on which he signed his contract. A free agent who signs a standard NBA player contract (or a player who signs, or is converted to, a standard NBA player contract while under a Two-Way Contract) cannot be traded for three months following the date the contract is signed or until December 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which the contract is signed, whichever is later. For sign-and-trade transactions , the foregoing rule does not apply to the initial trade but rather applies if the contract is traded a second time. In addition, if a team\u2019s Team Salary is over the Salary Cap immediately after it enters into a new contract with a Bird or Early Bird free agent using the Bird or Early Bird Exception and the salary in the first year of the contract is in excess of 120% of the player\u2019s salary in the prior season, then the foregoing rule shall not apply and instead the player cannot be traded for three months following the date the contract is signed or until January 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which the contract is signed, whichever is later. If a team trades a player and the player is subsequently waived by the new team, the prior team will not be permitted to claim the player off of waivers or sign the player to a new contract until the earlier of: (i) one year from the date the trade was completed, (ii) the July 1 following the last season of the player\u2019s contract* *excluding any unexercised option years ** FULL CBA EXPLANATION FOR ADDITIONAL TRADE RULES ** Prior to 2018, the trade deadline was held on the Thursday after the NBA All-Star Game. In February of 2017, Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins was traded immediately following the Feb. 19 game , where he had just represented the Kings for a third time ( scoring three points ). Cousins, who had been eligible for a supermax extension at the time, was averaging 27.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. He and Omri Casspi were dealt to the New Orleans Pelicans for Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway and a pair of Draft picks. The Pelicans and Kings both played Feb. 23 , giving the five players three days to land in their new homes. The deal\u2019s timing presented a logistical minefield for the players, their teammates, coaches and the various behind-the-scenes staffers coordinating the transition. Burbling trade rumors regarding Cousins also shaded the questioning during the NBA\u2019s All-Star weekend as well. Per the official release : \u201c With the new placement of the trade deadline, teams will be able to settle their rosters before the All-Star break and avoid the disruptions that result from players joining new teams just as practices and games are beginning to resume following the All-Star break.\u201d When the trade deadline date change was announced in July of 2017, as part of the annual Board of Governors meeting in July, Commissioner Adam Silver further explained the reasoning for the shift. \u201cThe motivation for moving the trade deadline before All-Star was the sense that it was more unsettling to have a player traded right after the All-Star break,\u201d Silver said at the 2017 NBA Summer League. \u201cThat All-Star break would\u2019ve been an opportunity for the player to move himself, his family, get their family readjusted, and get adjusted to the new team, when they would have that four- or five-day period to do that. There was really no magic to it \u2014 it was something we had discussed for several years.\u201d As for the potential roster complications stemming from a cross-conference trade involving a (potential) All-Star taking place prior to the game itself, Silver added: \u201cWe talked about it with the owners and decided rather than having a hard-and-fast rule, let\u2019s make the decision at the time. It hasn\u2019t happened very often. It\u2019s something that has come up before and we\u2019ll deal with it when it happens.\u201d"},{"id":512921,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-waiting-for-dynasty-to-begin","date":"2021-03-16","title":"Celtics still waiting for their dynasty to begin","content":"Not long after tipoff in a Celtics game last week, Kyrie Irving was a blur. He dribbled through and around defenders, dropped fadeaway jumpers and pulled up for 3-pointers to finish with 40 points . He was true to the prevailing theory in Boston that, if Irving played this way most nights, the Celtics would rarely lose. Well, they lost last Thursday and it was mainly because Irving was on the other team \u2014 the one he left Boston to join. The cruel coincidence was how the other team was the Brooklyn Nets, who were fleeced by the Celtics in a trade eight years ago that was designed to give the Celtics the look of a dynasty in the near future \u2014 right about now, actually. Instead, the Nets of all teams have passed by the Celtics \u2014 in the standings, in the number of superstars in uniform, in terms of a contender\u2019s gleam \u2014 while Boston is left to wonder what happened to their golden opportunity \u2026 and whether it\u2019s gone for good. From 2013-18, the Celtics were hauling a motherlode of treasures that left most of the league jealous: lottery picks, mid-first-round picks, salary cap space and good players already on the roster. They had enough foundation-building wealth to take ownership of the Eastern Conference, and perhaps the NBA, provided they used those goodies wisely. And why wouldn\u2019t they? The man in charge was Danny Ainge, a proven talent-evaluator and slick negotiator whose reasonable risks mostly paid off even before the Brooklyn trade. Plus, this was the Celtics: a destination franchise, thick with glorious history, championship banners and money to spend. Yet as they prepare to host the Utah Jazz, the 20-18 Celtics are merely a good team (perhaps no more than that) with a pair of All-Stars (neither of whom are Kia MVP material right now). After starting 2020-21 at 8-3, they went 7-14 from Jan. 17 to Feb. 24, generating fuss from a disgruntled fan base. Some of it was directed at coach Brad Stevens, who just a season ago was hailed as an ideal steward and final piece of the puzzle because of his smooth temperament and handling of the clipboard. Since the famous trade on July 12, 2013 that dumped the aging Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Jason Terry and others on a desperate Brooklyn team and gifted the Celtics four first-round picks, Boston reached the conference finals three times, losing all three. That\u2019s not exactly a shameful showing, and two of those defeats came to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, the big picture hints at a possible lost chance. All the Celtics have to show for their picks and cap space, in terms of impact players, is All-Stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. It\u2019s also about what they don\u2019t have to show for it: Losing Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and Terry Rozier over the last two years, four crucial rotational players (and in the case of Irving, a superstar), and getting nothing of equal value in return. Here\u2019s what transpired and conspired to prevent a dynasty, in a nutshell: Isaiah Thomas got hurt (and traded), Hayward got hurt, Irving soured on the team (and vice versa), Hayward recovered but bolted for a bigger role and Horford chased long-term security elsewhere. Irving fled and his replacement, Kemba Walker, has fallen a level since arriving. And only two of those four Brooklyn picks (Tatum and Brown) are currently on the roster. Again: Good team still \u2026 just not dynastic. Not even close. And right now, not even top-three in the East. Meanwhile, all those assets are spent. While speaking to 98.5\u2019s Toucher and Rich last Thursday , Ainge was realistic when he dismissed the Celtics as a title contender\u2014 to be fair, they were dealing with injuries then to Walker and Marcus Smart \u2014 said: \u201cOur roster obviously is not good. I mean, we are a 14-14 team. There\u2019s no ifs, ands or buts about it. That\u2019s who we are. This team, where we are, 14-14, if there\u2019s somebody to blame, this is Danny Ainge to blame. This is not Brad Stevens. It\u2019s not Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown. It\u2019s not good enough right now. And we all know that. And, you know, we need to get better.\u201d In hindsight, Ainge didn\u2019t do a poor job, nor was he wasteful with those assets. This will sound strange, but a franchise that touts a shamrock and leprechaun was a bit unlucky, especially with injuries. The cap space was understandably used on Horford, Hayward and Irving \u2014 three stars who, for separate reasons, didn\u2019t work out. Here is a look back at the key moments in Boston\u2019s timeline since the Pierce-Garnett trade: The 2014 pick: It was 17th overall because Brooklyn hadn\u2019t yet fallen off a cliff. Ainge drafted James Young, a 19-year-old shooter from Kentucky. It was a reasonable risk as Young had the present-day NBA skills that were supposed to be transferable \u2026 but they weren\u2019t. He played 95 career games, shot 27.7% on 3-pointers in his career and is out of the NBA. The 2016 pick: With the third overall selection, Ainge took Brown. At the time, Brown was somewhat of a questionable pick because he didn\u2019t stand out in his only year in California. He has gradually improved and was named an All-Star reserve in 2021. Thomas hurt in 2017, gets traded: The 5-foot-9 guard was acquired by Ainge from the Phoenix Suns at the 2015 trade deadline. He instantly became a TD Garden folk hero for his shooting, clutch play and showmanship. He went 43 straight games with 20 or more points , breaking John Havlicek\u2019s club record. After mourning the death of his sister in the 2017 playoffs, he eventually returned and scored 53 points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semis. He later suffered a serious hip injury that, to this day, haunts his career, which is being spent out of the NBA. The 2017 pick: The Nets had reached rock bottom, which was great for the Celtics because it turned into the No. 1 overall pick. And Ainge deftly spun it into even more gold, trading down with the Sixers to take Tatum and also get an extra No. 1. Tatum is now a two-time All-Star and rates among the league\u2019s best swingmen. But the Celtics were a bit unlucky here: The extra pick belonged to the Kings, traditionally a fixture in the Draft lottery. Yet they played reasonably well in 2019 and the pick dropped to No. 14. Ainge took Romeo Langford, a high school phenom who hasn\u2019t grown since and had wrist surgery last fall. Just before the Celtics took Langford, Miami took Tyler Herro. Hayward arrives in 2017, gets injured and then leaves: Ainge used a chunk of cap space on signing Hayward in 2017 at four years and $128 million, reuniting him with Stevens (his college coach). It was a universally hailed move, but Hayward sadly suffered a broken tibia and dislocated ankle in his Celtics debut. That ended his 2017-18 and his next season was an inconsistent one. By the time he began having flashbacks to his good years with the Utah Jazz, he was sharing time with Brown and Tatum. Anxious to start anew and carve a meatier role for himself, he headed to Charlotte via a sign-and-trade last offseason. Irving and the 2018 pick: Seizing the chance to grab a disgruntled superstar \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t? \u2014 Ainge packaged his final pick from the Brooklyn deal, along with some filler, to grab Irving . From a talent standpoint, this easily swung in Boston\u2019s favor. Irving was not long removed from his championship-winning shot against the Golden State Warriors. He was the savior the Celtics lacked and the move was widely celebrated in Boston. After first saying he wanted to stay in Boston, Irving waffled about signing long-term after his debut season, quickly wore on his teammates and the city with his various moods and questionable comments, before finally signing with Brooklyn in 2019. As for that 2018 pick? It became Collin Sexton, a budding star in Cleveland. In a less impactful event, Horford opted out and signed with the Sixers two summers ago. It was yet another defection in a short time span that caused stress within the Boston organization and dealt the Celtics a setback. Ainge might have done a few things differently if given the chance. Instead of protecting those picks, he could\u2019ve dealt them for immediate help, much like he did to get Irving. At various times, Ainge was in play for Anthony Davis and Paul George, although in each case, signing those players to long-term deals wasn\u2019t guaranteed (and both wanted to go to Los Angeles, where they eventually landed). Plus, the best of those picks became Brown and Tatum. And so, the Celtics have arrived here: squarely in the East playoff mix and still aspiring for so much more. Tatum and Brown are young, healthy and signed long term while rest of the roster isn\u2019t so secure. Walker has suffered from nagging injuries and sub-par shooting in his time with Boston. Friendly and team-oriented, he was a welcome change from Irving in that regard, yet Irving is the better player. Marcus Smart is a solid defender and improving shooter, but may never be good offensively. Everyone else is either developing or maxed out and beyond their prime. This is what Boston is bringing against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the Sixers, and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks \u2026 and Kyrie, Kevin Durant and James Harden and the Nets. Those teams boast game-changing superstars and MVP candidates, exactly the level of talent Boston figured to flaunt by now. The dynasty projected for the Celtics years ago has yet to materialize, and that bounty they received from Brooklyn is gone. In an interesting twist, a handful of other teams have since followed Boston\u2019s example and began hoarding picks over the last few years. That strategy may pay off eventually for Oklahoma City and New Orleans and Houston. However, the Celtics are proof that nothing is for certain. In a 2013 lopsided trade that shook the league, the Celtics were initially celebrated \u2026 yet in Brooklyn right now, it\u2019s the losing team that\u2019s plotting a dynasty. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

But it\u2019s there nonetheless, and for a rare reason. First, of course, the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 center needs to heal from the bone bruise in his left knee he suffered against Washington last week. That has him on a 2-3 week hiatus . That means Embiid isn\u2019t available to help the Sixers maintain their lead atop the Eastern Conference . Though they\u2019ve won three blowouts since the All-Star break, the Sixers are 3-5 this season without Embiid, heading into their game against New York Wednesday. Then there\u2019s Embiid\u2019s front-runner status in the Kia MVP race. Based on the estimated layoff, the big man could miss another 6-9 games, which could mean 17 of Philadelphia\u2019s first 48. Even if he didn\u2019t miss any more after that, Embiid then would max out at 55 games in the 72-game season (76.3%). Only 1978 MVP Bill Walton (58 of 82, 70.7%) ever won the award while playing less than 80% of his team\u2019s games. That brings us to the issue Embiid \u2013 who has stated he wants to win the DPOY award \u2013 faces here. His Sixers teammate, Ben Simmons, is considered an equal or greater candidate for the honor. And that could split some votes when the media panel filling out ballots tries to apportion their contributions to their team\u2019s No. 2 ranked defense. Simmons is a versatile wing defender capable of shadowing everyone from point guards to power forwards. He routinely gets assigned to opponents\u2019 most potent scorers. Embiid is a load in the middle who plants himself in the minds of rim attackers everywhere, while dealing with other teams\u2019 bigs. As a tandem, they\u2019re terrific and another example of the \u201cit takes more than one\u201d philosophy Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert spoke about here last week . But this is an individual award. Teammates have appeared in the past in the final tally. Last season, Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo won it while center Brook Lopez placed 10th. In 2018, the Top 10 featured four sets of teammates: Embiid (2) and Robert Covington (8), New Orleans\u2019 Anthony Davis (3) and Jrue Holiday (7), Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green (6) and Kevin Durant (9), and Boston\u2019s Al Horford (5) and Jaylen Brown (10). None of those pairs, even with their vote totals combined, was a threat to runaway winner Gobert. But twice in DPOY voting, teammates split enough votes to allow a third candidate to win. In 2015, Green (317 balloting points) and Andrew Bogut (31) split credit for the Warriors\u2019 defensive excellence as San Antonio\u2019s Kawhi Leonard (333) won his first of consecutive awards. In 1994, it happened with the Spurs\u2019 David Robinson (22 votes) and Dennis Rodman (8) drawing votes from each other. Houston\u2019s Hakeem Olajuwon, while a worthy winner of his second straight DPOY, finished with 23. Embiid\u2019s availability might be the biggest hurdle he faces in consideration for the NBA\u2019s major awards. That actually might boost Simmons\u2019 chances, though, as voters sort through arguments on behalf of the Sixers guard and a different dominant big man (Gobert). (All stats through Sunday, March 14) Last week\u2019s ranking: 1 Even Justin Kutcher, the Washington Wizards\u2019 play-by-play announcer on NBCSports Washington and the latest, greatest critic of Simmons\u2019 game (judged by social media overreaction last week), immediately clarified his opinion to tout the Philadelphia guard\u2019s defensive prowess. An extended stretch of games without Embiid \u2013 but with Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley Jr. as solid surrogates \u2013 might test Simmons\u2019 numbers and spot atop the Ladder. Last week\u2019s ranking: 2 In two games since the All-Star break, the Jazz center has blocked a total of 10 shots against Houston and Golden State. But wait, there\u2019s more: With his 24-point, 28-rebound and 4-swat performance in the loss to the Warriors Sunday, Gobert became only the sixth player to reach those thresholds in a game since the league began tracking blocks in 1973-74, a.k.a., after both Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were retired. The most recent guy to do it was four-time DPOY winner Dikembe Mutombo in December 1999. Last week\u2019s ranking: 3 There\u2019s some interesting defensive-tandem action going on in Indianapolis, where center Myles Turner leads the NBA in blocked shots ( 122 ) and blocks per game ( 3.4 ), while backup point guard T.J. McConnell leads the league in steals ( 66 ) and steals per game ( 1.9 ). McConnell is doing that at 25.1 minutes per game. On a per-36 basis, he\u2019d be up to 2.7, the most since Chris Paul led the NBA with 2.77 while averaging 38.5 minutes in 2008-09. But this is a Turner entry, so we\u2019ll end with Lakers coach Frank Vogel on the Pacers\u2019 big: \u201cMyles is obviously the league leader in shot-blocking so we have to be smart about how we attack him there.\u201d Turner blocked only two shots vs. L.A., fewest in a five-game stretch in which he got 18 of them. Last week\u2019s ranking: 5 Big man Anthony Davis has been out a month now, yet there the Lakers sit atop the league in defensive efficiency (106.0), a sizable edge over Philadelphia (108) and Utah (108.3). And there\u2019s James, leading all players in defensive win shares (0.183) by an equally impressive margin. The 36-year-old future Hall of Famer has a defensive field goal percentage of 40.6% compared to the 46% they normally shoot. That 5.4% difference ranks seventh among players who have logged at least 30 games and face 9.5 shots or more per game. And that makes James the top-ranked non-center. Last week\u2019s ranking: N\/A We\u2019ll go with a placeholder here this week for the injured Embiid or, for that matter, any other player hoping to grab one of the top rungs on this Defensive Ladder. Green, who was named DPOY in 2017 and has been a five-time All-Defensive Team selection, touted his worthiness for consideration again this season after the Warriors beat Gobert\u2019s Jazz Sunday. \u201cWe gotta win more games,\u201d said the undersized leader of Golden State\u2019s No. 7 ranked defense. \u201cWe win more games, climb the standings, I think there\u2019s no question that I\u2019ll be Defensive Player of the Year. There\u2019s no defender better than me. So there you have it.\u201d It\u2019s good to keep defense linked with winning \u2013 no one from a sub-.500 team has won DPOY since San Antonio\u2019s Alvin Robertson in 1986. As far as analytics, Green\u2019s 6.1% difference in defensive field goal percentage isn\u2019t far behind Gobert\u2019s 6.9 and Turner\u2019s 6.4. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Play-In Tournament, which will take place after the regular season and before the first round of the playoffs, will include the teams with the seventh-highest through the tenth-highest winning percentages in each conference. Q: When is the Play-In Tournament?  The Play-In Tournament will begin Tuesday, May 18 and conclude Friday, May 21 . The teams with the seventh-highest and eighth-highest winning percentages in each conference will each have two opportunities to win one game to earn a playoff spot. The teams with the ninth-highest and tenth-highest winning percentages in each conference will each have to win two consecutive games to earn a playoff spot.  Q: How will the Play-In Tournament be structured?  At the conclusion of the regular season but before the first round of the playoffs, the team with the 7th-highest winning percentage in each conference will host the team with the 8th-highest winning percentage in a Play-In Game (the \u201cSeven-Eight Game\u201d). The winner of the Seven-Eight Game in each conference will earn the No. 7 seed. The team with the 9th-highest winning percentage in each conference will host the team with the 10th-highest winning percentage in the \u201cNine-Ten Game\u201d. The loser of the Seven-Eight Game will host the winner of the Nine-Ten Game in a Play-In Game, and the winner of that game in each conference will earn the No. 8 seed.  Q: What happens to the winners of the Play-In Tournament?  The winners of the Play-In tournament will receive the 7th and 8th-seeded positions in each conference. Following the Play-In Tournament, the NBA Playoffs will commence with the traditional 16-team, best-of-seven series structure.  Q: When Do The Playoffs Start?  The NBA Playoffs will start on Saturday, May 22 and conclude no later than July 22.

The former is something like, oh, Robert Parish and Kevin McHale for Joe Barry Carroll back in the day, arguably the most exceptional trade in league history (for the Boston Celtics, anyway). The latter is a mechanism of NBA rules and regulations overseeing team-to-team transactions, a credit voucher of sorts that has a lot more to do with salary-cap accounting than it does with post moves or perimeter shooting. Which is not to say, however, that a trade exception is entirely bloodless and without its own excitement. Since when isn\u2019t $28.5 million exciting? Consider the Celtics again, who currently hold the biggest trade exception in history \u2014 that $28.5 million \u2014 thanks to some maneuvering by team president of basketball operations Danny Ainge as free-agent swingman Gordon Hayward was packing his bags to join the Charlotte Hornets prior to this season. The timeline of the deal and the generation of the trade exception went something like this: Bottom line, the Celtics gave up two future second-round picks for the privilege of waving goodbye to Hayward. Why? Because Ainge wanted the trade exception created by the apparently lopsided deal. By trading Hayward to Charlotte and taking nothing back in salary, the Celtics created the trade exception equal to Hayward\u2019s first-year salary, in this case $28.5 million. The exception can be used to trade for a player or multiple players with salaries adding up to that amount without adding to their cap and luxury-tax liabilities. The value goes down with salaries of the players taken in \u2014 a $10 million player acquired by the Celtics would leave them with $18.5 on the exception. Oh, and these are for trades only, not free-agent signings. They\u2019re available only to teams without cap space, not those able to maneuver freely under the cap, which is $109.1 million for the 2020-21 season. It\u2019s all part of the Traded Player Exception clause in the NBA\u2019s and National Basketball Players Association\u2019s collective bargaining agreement . And it is good for one year \u2014 to be used by next week\u2019s trade deadline, in the 2021 offseason or, as often happens, not at all. The Celtics are just the greatest current example based on the size of their exception for Hayward. They also have a $5 million one from trading away center Enes Kanter ( to Portland ) and a $2.5 million one from shipping big man Vincent Poirier ( to OKC ) in November (as part of the Al Horford-to-OKC trade). Denver has a $9.5 million trade exception from the deal it struck with Detroit involving forward Jerami Grant. Houston got a $10.6 million one when the dust cleared from James Harden\u2019s move to Brooklyn . Probably half the teams in the league hold trade exceptions worth $1 million or more, or even a few hundred thousand dollars. The concept of a trade exception harkens back to older CBA systems in which teams actually held onto salary \u201cslots\u201d when players left, allowing them to slip other players of similar salaries into vacant roster spots. Only this is more like an old-fashioned gift card, with an expiration date before it loses its value. And oh yeah, if you use it, you have to spend the money. That\u2019s the quieter end of the trade-exception process, the fact that so many teams simply let them slip off the books when the year is up, because a proper trade didn\u2019t materialize, the front office shifted priorities \u2026 or ownership decided against spending the money. They at least are great for cleaning up the books in the season generated. They also enable general managers to save face in situations such as the Hayward decision, to salvage something out of a deal when their cap situation otherwise would not permit an exchange of salaries. When you think through it, another Celtics star comes to mind: Larry Bird. He was the player whose re-signing necessitated the \u201cBird rights\u201d wrinkle in the salary-cap rules, the provision enabling teams to keep their own players whether they\u2019re above the cap or not. The flip side of that, in an era when teams can exceed the cap by tens of millions of dollars, is that losing such a player doesn\u2019t necessarily open up space. The trade exception is the intended solution. If a team uses it, if a team finds deals to its liking, if a team actually is eager to push the payroll to or beyond tax thresholds. One way to look at a trade exception is like an insurance policy or an extended warranty. They are good to have, even if you never use them. Also, the folks at HoopRumors.com maintain a regularly updated list of trade exceptions. Do Ainge and the Celtics face some pressure to use all or some of the trade exception by March 25? Sure. You can\u2019t hold any asset that rates as the biggest in NBA history without focusing extra interest on what becomes of it. Add Boston\u2019s lackluster performance that has them barely above .500 and flirting with a lower playoff seed, with the much loftier expectations for this group, and fans expect to see some moves, now or certainly before the exception slips away. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Cash also recognizes the scope of her role expands beyond what transpires on the court. Hired in 2019 as vice president of basketball operations and team development for the New Orleans Pelicans, Cash entered the organization with incredible pedigree as a three-time WNBA champion (two with the Detroit Shock, one with the Seattle Storm), a four-time All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist. \u201cHer legendary experience as a player, champion and winner at every level, on and off the floor, represents everything we want this organization to be about,\u201d said Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin. In celebration of Women\u2019s History Month, Cash spent some time with NBA.com dishing on her history, her role in New Orleans, childhood acting aspirations, and the WNBA\u2019s stature as leaders at the forefront of the current movement for social justice and equality in this wide-ranging Q&A: NBA.com: What does Women\u2019s History Month mean to you? Cash: The way I look at Women\u2019s History Month is just an opportunity to spotlight women just in general. Not only women that are in the workplace, women that are stay-at-home moms, it just doesn\u2019t matter. I think when you have marginalized groups of people who have had to fight for different rights, it feels good to have that month where you can just at least celebrate them. But for me, it\u2019s the same as Black History Month; 365 [days a year] I\u2019m still a woman, I\u2019m still Black in America. We celebrate who we are as a people year-round. For us around the country, for people that just continue on a day-to-day all this time it\u2019s a good opportunity to take a pause, to spotlight and try to honor women. Before you decided to take on the executive role in New Orleans, you said you had to do your research and homework. You said you reached out to female friends in the NBA and some male allies. Who were some of those calls to, and what were some of your questions and concerns about ultimately making that decision to take the job with the Pelicans? I prefer not to disclose all of the names. One of the things I did do is I talked to [people], and I didn\u2019t reveal what opportunity it was. It was just more so trying to get their feedback because they either had been in the position or had been asked or interviewed for certain positions to be on a team. So, one of the people I will reveal was Isiah Thomas because I worked with him in New York. He was the first person that actually hired me right after my retirement to come into the front office and created the first hybrid position with the New York Liberty that I had, which was Director of Franchise Development. So, it gave me an opportunity to work on both our basketball ops side and to work with the business side. Creating that position I think was really instrumental in giving me exposure to the business and the ops side. I really wanted to get his take because he was a team president in both the NBA and the WNBA, which is really unique. Then, for me, one of my confidantes is [Virginia Cavaliers women\u2019s basketball coach] Tina Thompson. Tina\u2019s a coach now, but she\u2019s a legend in the game and has been like a big sister to me. I just was kind of getting her feedback because I was at the point of being a mom and changing careers and different things. So, talking to her was just from a holistic standpoint of where I was as a wife and as a mother. One of the funny ones though is I did have a quick conversation with Kenny Smith, just asking him about going to teams and what that kind of looks like. He\u2019s had opportunities in the past and has thought about it. So, I just wanted to pick his brain about what would make you leave the comfort of television and have the autonomy to do other things you want to do. The great advice that Kenny had given me was: \u2018You have to look at the opportunity and weigh who you\u2019re working with. Will you have the ability to impact?\u2019 That was some great advice from him because a lot of times, people just look at the opportunity. They don\u2019t necessarily look at [the reality that] you can only create change or be successful in a role, especially as a woman, if we have male allies and people who support women. I had that in [Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations [David] Griff[in] right away. So, that was good for me. You really thought this thing all the way through huh? Well, yeah, I had a one-and-a-half-year-old [son]. But you\u2019re talking about uprooting my whole family; my husband [Steve Canal], he\u2019s an entrepreneur, has a successful job, has clients and an office in New York. It\u2019s not just me. I think a lot of times, people are like, oh, you just up and go. But I was happily, and still am, married and had a child and thinking are we gonna have No. 2, which I just had. There\u2019s a lot more that goes into just taking an NBA job. I don\u2019t do anything, I don\u2019t work with partners, I don\u2019t do different stuff unless I do my research, unless it\u2019s something I feel strongly about. You and Sue Bird were roommates in college at UConn, and I\u2019ve heard her on quite a few podcasts recently. She seems like the coolest woman in the world. Is she? There are so many different stories. We just pick and choose what we share. The thing I\u2019m most impressed with is that from where we were when we were younger to see where she is now, and how she is happy in walking in her truth and being an ally and a force in this from a social justice and equality standpoint, it just makes me smile. I think one day we\u2019ll all have to sit down and talk about it. I would like for her to even share more about how she\u2019s gotten to that point. She\u2019s done a good job of communicating. But Sue wasn\u2019t always like that. Not saying she wasn\u2019t supportive, but it\u2019s hard to kind of walk in a truth whenever confrontation comes and people push back. To see her strength, her growth and us as sisters, that to me \u2026 I\u2019m just so proud of her. And the fact that she\u2019s still playing [is amazing]. I told her, \u2018Your knees and whatever Keto diet you\u2019re on, you just keep doing that.\u2019 People are starting to see the personality that she has and using her platform. I\u2019ve just been so genuinely proud, and happy about that. The one thing that is funny about Birdie is the fact that she\u2019s definitely always one to clown about some stuff. She\u2019s clowning me. Maybe like six or seven years ago, she\u2019s clowning me like, \u2018Why are you wearing glasses that don\u2019t have the prescription in them?\u2019 Or, \u2018Why are you wearing glasses that don\u2019t have the lenses in them?\u2019 I had played in China. So, a lot of my teammates over there were wearing glasses and taking the whole lens out. So, I thought I was cool and doing it. Birdie\u2019s like clowning me, right? Fast forward to maybe like a year or two ago, I see her with these glasses on, and people are like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s fashion. She\u2019s killin\u2019 it.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, so now you\u2019re the cool chick with the glasses on with no prescription? Oh, OK. I got you. But you didn\u2019t want to respect over here when I was doing it back in the day.\u2019 That\u2019s the type of stuff that we get on each other for. We love chopping it up. But Sue is really, really funny. You\u2019ve won on virtually every level. Are there certain themes, characteristics or habits that you see as just synonymous to success on and off the court? I would say part of my mentality and upbringing \u2026 basketball was always an outlet for me. People ask me all the time: \u2018When did you start preparing for life after basketball?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yo, the day they said I was the No. 2 pick and I got drafted.\u2019 My brain just went into \u2018What\u2019s the next in my survival mode after that?\u2019 And a lot of that is my upbringing. Whenever Kobe [Bryant] came out and was talking about this Mamba mentality and the ability to lock in, everything he talked about, people always think it applies to the court. To me, it was like having that type of mentality applies to life, especially when you come from humble beginnings, and you know this is your way out. This is your way to have success, get the things you want and have the life you want. So, I approached the game and I\u2019ve approached my career the same way. One of your main responsibilities as a leader within the Pelicans organization is to help that franchise establish a certain type of culture. What does that look like to you? That looks like everything. Our culture, people use it and sometimes it\u2019s one of those catchy, clich\u00e9 words. But it\u2019s just literally how you do business. How do we do business here in New Orleans? How do we take care of our players? How do we take care of our staff? When people come here, what are their expectations that are set? Is this department or that department operating in lockstep with the other one? Being a part of other winning organizations has helped me see how things kind of operate together. Being here and being able to apply different strategies, being able to streamline things, that\u2019s what you look for. How we do business is how we create culture. When you were working with Griffin at NBA TV, you engaged in plenty of conversations about the game and the players. Some of those conversations had to have gotten intense, right? Well, it was never just Griff and I getting intense. You know everybody else is in there, too. I think the greatest thing about Turner is we all could sit there in a space and have conversations, whether it\u2019s about the games going on, pop culture, things that are happening, all of that. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re on NBA TV or the guys on Inside, everybody\u2019s still there. That is what created where Candace [Parker] is right now, where Allie [LaForce] is and Stephanie [Ready]. Those are my girls. Working with them and being in that same space, it never was the guys saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s the female over there.\u2019 We were all talking hoops. I think that level of respect is something that was appreciated. With Griff coming from winning championships, having his success and coming up through the ranks of the NBA, I think he was probably evaluating me at the time, and I had no clue. You think your honesty in those basketball conversations resonated with Griff? Yeah, I think you just win people over when you\u2019re yourself. I don\u2019t expect everybody to love everything about me, but where\u2019s our common thread? Then, let me be very, very clear: I\u2019m here also learning things. I can help, and I\u2019m applying and I\u2019m doing my job. But I\u2019m also learning. I\u2019m learning from Griff. There are certain things I\u2019ve taken and learned from [Pelican GM] Trajan [Langdon]. This isn\u2019t the Swin Cash show. But it is being with a collective of like-minded people that are trying to get a job done. That, to me, is the fun part. That\u2019s why I enjoy going to work. Yes, I need to figure out how we\u2019re doing X, Y, and Z. But at the same time, I\u2019m learning a part of the business that I need to sharpen my tools with if I want to continue to grow. This isn\u2019t an end stop for me. We all have different goals that we want to achieve. But I think you have to master one thing before you can move on to the next. Everybody knows your background as a basketball player, but you are also really into entertainment and performance art. What was the experience like for you as an actress on the sequel of the movie Bring It On? Being in \u201cBring it On: All or Nothing\u201d was really fun. I think it\u2019s dope to think about being in \u201cBring it On.\u201d One day whenever my boys see that movie, I\u2019m gonna let them know I was in a movie that I played myself. For a WNBA player, that to me was the dopest thing at the time because the last time I remember would be like Lisa Leslie and Dawn [Staley] on Martin just being themselves. They say my name in the movie and the guy talks about the Detroit Shock. And even though the Shock aren\u2019t here anymore, that\u2019s history right there. That to me, was really dope. I think every kid has asked me since that movie came out about, \u2018Oh my God, you know Rihanna.\u2019 And this was like before Rihanna was Rihanna. That was super, super fun. I will tell you this: I\u2019ve been blessed throughout my career to experience things in different industries that I am very, very grateful for. What type of character could you see yourself playing? And if you were on the HBO show Insecure, what role would best fit you? Angela Bassett is like the Don. She\u2019s like the Don Dada. I love her. She is one of the best actresses, I swear. I would think on Insecure, yeah, I definitely would be Molly. I definitely would kill Molly\u2019s role. I would love to play that role. Throughout the pandemic with this backdrop of everything going on with social justice and equality, if we\u2019re being real about this, the WNBA has been at the forefront of the whole movement. What are your thoughts about the role the WNBA has played in advancing the movement?  I absolutely think the W has been and will continue to be at the forefront when it comes to social justice. What I\u2019m most proud of right now is how united our women are in not only their fight, but the demand for equality, the demand for resources, and to grow the league. I will tell you the very difficult CBA that we had signed before this recent one they did last year was very difficult because we were at a point where it was like this league could either fold, or the women are gonna realize we need to stand up and fight to change it. But timing is everything, and I think our women had recognized as the country is having this reckoning, let\u2019s have one right now about these issues. As we continue to move forward, I think it\u2019s gonna be even more prevalent. Seeing Renee [Montgomery] do what she did down there in Atlanta in becoming an executive and ownership, let\u2019s flip the script. I\u2019ll tell you right now there were times back when I played when I used to speak up and be so frustrated because we\u2019re the league, and partners of ours would do commercials or shoe companies would do commercials and they would use an actress to play a basketball player. I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, you\u2019re a partner with our league, and you mean to tell me not one of these women are worthy to be in this commercial?\u2019 So, my fight was always deeper than that because I always saw the underlying issues with it. So, now, to see people are being called out and held accountable to invest in women, to bet on women, as our WNBA players say. That, to me, makes me so proud. OK, this last question is sort of deep. But you retweeted a post from Halle Berry a while back where she said, \u201cIt\u2019s still Protect Black Women.\u201d How do you feel about sort of knowing that for the most part throughout history, it seems it has always been Black women stepping up and supporting Black men \u2014 women of all nationalities, really \u2014 but it seems collectively we haven\u2019t done the same as men? How do we do better? It\u2019s hard because it\u2019s been so long, and you have so much history, whether it\u2019s your grandma talking to you about it, your mama, your auntie. We\u2019ve had to endure. We\u2019re raised to endure. We\u2019re raised to know that X, Y, and Z is coming. I try to just continue to look forward and understand my history, but not hold people to what\u2019s happened in the past. It\u2019s, \u2018What are you doing now? How are you being better now?\u2019 I think the way that people can be better is to acknowledge, first, that there is an issue whether it\u2019s systemic racism, sexism, whatever the case may be. We have to change things whether it\u2019s in our hiring practices, whether it\u2019s in our training, there are spaces. The reason I retweeted that is I felt it in my spirit. People just assume that as Black women that we\u2019re strong, or when it\u2019s time to step up we\u2019re gonna do it. We\u2019ve shown that we do the right thing. We have a moral compass. We try to vote with the right conscience and all these different things. But what about our mental health? What about having to navigate in spaces where people have stereotypes that are about us? I just felt that in my heart, and I felt like if we don\u2019t speak up about it, if we don\u2019t keep it top of mind in our society, this microwave society right now, something that happens in 10 minutes just goes away five minutes [later] and then we\u2019re onto the next thing. I just don\u2019t want to see that happen. Because I have a platform, because I have a following, I can use that to empower and make the world better somehow. And that\u2019s not just saying that I feel that way only with Black women. Yes, I\u2019m a Black woman. So, these issues affect me. But I still speak up for all women. I speak up for all races. But I do feel that it is important to speak in your own truth. Do I feel some type of pushback or do I feel that as being an executive, you have to change that? No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. You know why? Because I think as soon as you get into a position where you feel that keeping a job is more important than protecting your rights, your son\u2019s rights or your family\u2019s ability to just exist, then you\u2019ve compromised all of your integrity. I try to pride myself on having integrity. And this fight that we\u2019re in to change not only stereotypes, but the systemic racism and other things we have in our country, it\u2019s important for a mother like me who has two young African-American sons that I want to be raised in a world that is much better and advanced than where I was. So, I guess that\u2019s my long, but short answer. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

Monday, March 15 LA Clippers (25-5) at Dallas (20-17)  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass We\u2019ve had this matchup circled on the League Pass calendar since the second half of the season schedule was released. Here\u2019s what we wrote then : This is a rematch of last year\u2019s first-round playoff matchup, which the Clippers won, 4-2. The Mavericks won the first meeting with the Clippers this season in spectacular fashion as they led by an NBA-record 50 points at the half and finished with a 124-73 win for their first victory of the season on December 27. Both teams were missing a key player in the first meeting: Kawhi Leonard for LA and Kristaps Porzingis for Dallas. Tuesday, March 16 New York (20-19) at Philadelphia (27-12)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Sixers enter Week 13 riding a five-game win streak (tied with Atlanta for the longest active streak in the league) and holding onto first place in the Eastern Conference (with Brooklyn just one game back). The Sixers climbed to second in this week\u2019s NBA.com Power Rankings despite losing Joel Embiid for the next few weeks due to a bone bruise. The Sixers blew out the Spurs in their first game since the MVP candidate\u2019s injury, but have gone just 3-5 this season without Embiid in the lineup. The Knicks enter this week ranked seventh in the East as they try to climb out of the Play-In Tournament field (7-10). Wednesday, March 17 Miami (21-18) at Memphis (17-18)  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Here comes the Heat. The defending Eastern Conference champs have won 10 of their last 11 games to climb from 11th to fourth place in the East as they enter Week 13. Jimmy Butler has averaged 25 points, 9.1 assists, 6.8 rebounds and 2.6 steals while appearing in nine of the Heat\u2019s last 11 games . Can Miami keep this momentum going against a Grizzlies squad looking to get back on track after dropping three of their last four games by a combined eight points? Thursday, March 18 New Orleans (17-22) at Portland (22-16)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass As we get deeper into the season schedule, the Play-In Tournament looms large for teams sitting in that No. 5 to No. 12 range in the standings \u2013 currently those eight teams are separated by just 5.5 games. There\u2019s a team like Portland, which enters Week 13 in sixth place in the West, and is looking to stay above the No. 7 spot in order to avoid the Play-In Tournament to qualify for the playoffs. Then there\u2019s a team like New Orleans, which enters Week 13 in 11th place in the West, and is looking to climb into the No. 7-10 range in order to qualify for the Play-In and keep their playoff hopes alive. Friday, March 19 Minnesota (9-30) at Phoenix (25-12)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Chris Paul enters Week 13 needing 30 assist to become the sixth player in NBA history to reach the 10,000 career assists milestone \u2013 joining John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Mark Jackson and Magic Johnson in the exclusive club. Paul could reach 10K as early as this game against Minnesota, which will Phoenix\u2019s third game of the week. Paul currently ranks fifth the league at 8.8 assists per game, so in order to reach 10K in three games he would need to outperform his season average a little bit. He does have 14 double-digit assist games already this season, including a 15-assist game against Minnesota on Feb. 28. Saturday, March 20 Atlanta (19-20) at Los Angeles Lakers (25-13)  3:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Hawks enter Week 13 tied with Philadelphia for the longest active win streak in the league at five in a row \u2013 all under new head coach Nate McMillan \u2013 to climb to eighth place in the Eastern Conference and within one win of matching last season\u2019s total (20-47). This game in Los Angeles begins an eight-game road trip for the Hawks that may go a long way to determining their playoff or Play-In fate. The Lakers have won three straight against the Hawks and eight of the last nine games in the all-time series dating back to November 2016. Keep an eye on Dennis Schroder, who spent the first five seasons of his career with Atlanta, who has averaged 19 points, 6.3 assists and shot 50% form the field and 56% from 3-point range in four career games against his former team. Sunday, March 21 Dallas (20-17) at Portland (22-16)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Another matchup we circled on the League Pass calendar earlier this year as it features two of the top scorers in the NBA in Damian Lillard (who enters Week 13 ranked second in the league in scoring at 29.9 ppg) and Luka Doncic (who ranks sixth at 28.2 ppg). Both players know how to deliver when the game is on the line. In the final minute of a one possession game (ahead or behind by three points or less), Lillard is 7-11 from the field, 3-5 from 3-point range and 12-12 from the free throw line; Doncic is 5-9 from the field, 2-5 from 3-point range and has four assists in those situations. In their first meeting of the season on Feb. 14 , Lillard scored 34 points \u2014 including a step-back three with 32 seconds left to break a tie and put the Blazers up for good \u2013 despite Luka scoring 44 points."},{"id":512349,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-monday-march-15-2021","date":"2021-03-15","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Monday, March 15, 2021","content":"Knicks (20-19) at Nets (26-13)  8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Brooklyn won first meeting with the Knicks, 116-109 on Jan. 13 , behind 26 points from Kevin Durant. Kyrie Irving did not play in the contest, and the James Harden trade had not been completed. This time around Irving and Harden will play and Durant will be out due to a hamstring injury; the Nets have gone 14-6 this season without Durant. \u2022 Durant has not played since Feb. 13 due to the hamstring injury; the Nets have gone 10-1 in those games with James Harden nearly averaging a triple-double with team highs of 28.1 points, 10.6 assists and 9.7 rebounds. Kyrie Irving has added 26.8 points, 5.9 assists and 5.3 rebounds during this stretch. \u2022 While the Nets lead the NBA in offensive efficiency (118.0 points per 100 possessions) and effective field goal percentage (58.6%), they will face a stingy Knicks defense that ranks fourth in defensive efficiency (108.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) and allows the second-lowest effective field goal percentage (51.2%). \u2022 Nerlens Noel ranks fourth in the league in blocks (2.0 per game) despite averaging just 22.2 minutes per game. The last player to average at least two blocks while playing fewer than 23 minutes per game also plays for the Knicks \u2013 Mitchell Robinson in 2018-19 (2.4 bpg in 20.6 mpg). \u2022 James Harden enters Monday averaging 25.2 points and 11.0 assists per game. There have been only five seasons in NBA history when a player has averaged at least 25 points and 11 assists. Harden was the last player to do it in 2016-17 with Houston; prior to that it has not been done in 44 seasons, when Nate \u201cTiny\u201d Archibald became the only player to lead the NBA in both categories in 1972-73. The only other player to do it is Oscar Robertson (3x). Lakers (25-13) at Warriors (20-19)  10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 The Lakers and Warriors have split their first two meetings of the season. LeBron James has been the Lakers\u2019 top scorer against Golden State at 19.0 ppg, while Stephen Curry has been the Warriors\u2019 top scorer against Los Angeles at 21.0 ppg. For both All-Stars it is their lowest scoring average against any team they have faced more than once this season. \u2022 While Stephen Curry nearly averages five 3-pointers made per game ( league-high 4.8 ), he has been held to 5-19 (26.3%) shooting from beyond the arc in two game against the Lakers this season. Dennis Schroder has spent the fourth-most time defending Curry of any player this season (9:16), and has held Curry to 1-13 shooting from the field including 0-10 on 3-pointers over two games. \u2022 Which team will control the paint? The Lakers rank sixth in points in the paint (51.9 ppg) while the Warriors rank fifth in allowing the fewest points in the paint (44.5 ppg). Golden State ranks second in the league in rim protection , allowing teams to shoot just 59.8% at the basket while they are defending. \u2022 The Lakers have the sixth-highest scoring bench in the league at 39.5 points per game, which accounts for 35.5% of their total offense. The bench is anchored by reigning Sixth Man of the Year Montrezl Harrell, who ranks sixth among eligible bench players in scoring (14.1 ppg) and seventh in rebounding (6.5 rpg) \u2022 The Lakers are 13-6 in games featuring clutch time (score inside of five points in final five minutes of fourth quarter or overtime). LeBron James ranks seventh in clutch scoring with 74 points on 47.6% shooting form the field and 39.3% on 3-pointers. Stephen Curry lead the Warriors (9-8 in clutch games) with 67 clutch points (12th in NBA) on 40.9% shooting from the field, 47.6% on 3-pointers and a perfect 21-21 on free throws."},{"id":512360,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-conclusion-of-elijah-millsap-investigation","date":"2021-03-15","title":"NBA announces conclusion of Elijah Millsap investigation","content":"NEW YORK AND SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 The National Basketball Association announced today the results of a joint investigation with independent, outside counsel to the Utah Jazz into an allegation made by former Jazz player Elijah Millsap on February 24, 2021 that team Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Dennis Lindsey made an inappropriate statement six years ago during Millsap\u2019s April 2015 exit interview.

With Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid all on the shelf with injuries, the Los Angeles Lakers, Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers have no choice but to wait things out. Seeding matters and all three teams have marquee games on the horizon, but a few marquee games in March are not worth risking a playoff series in May or June. Those three guys could each be the difference between an early exit and a championship. The Lakers are struggling to score without Davis.

And we\u2019re about to find out what the Sixers are without Embiid, though they got an easy win over a good team without him on Sunday.

This weekly column will highlight players rostered in fewer than 50% of Yahoo leagues who may help you ascertain fantasy glory. The Lakers are the only team to play five games this week. 20 teams will play four games while the rest will play three. 19 teams will play on a back-to-back, with the Lakers playing two of them. For a look at the schedule grid with offensive pace ratings, click HERE . Rudy Gay (SF\/PF \u2013 SA): 24% rostered Gay has scored double figures in six of the last seven games. Over the last two games, he\u2019s played 27 and 20 minutes, with the latter being a blowout, so he probably would\u2019ve played close to 27 minutes again. With LaMarcus Aldridge out of the picture, Gay should see consistent playing time in the mid-20s. He garners a healthy usage rate in the mid-20s as well, so when he\u2019s on the court, he\u2019s going to be involved. Gay can provide points, 3-pointers, rebounds, and some defensive stats from time to time. Jaylen Nowell (SG \u2013 MIN): 5% rostered If you need a jolt of points, Nowell could be an option for you. Over the last seven games, he\u2019s scored in double figures and played over 20 minutes in five of those contests. Now, four of those contests were blowouts but, more recently, he\u2019s played 28 and 28.2 minutes and scored 17 and 28 points, respectively. He\u2019s been scorching hot, shooting 50% and 84%, so you can\u2019t expect that on the regular. Case in point, in the prior two games, he shot 22% and 12%. With that said, when he\u2019s on the floor, he\u2019s going to hoist shots and can grab boards and dish out some assists occasionally. Robert Williams (C \u2013 BOS): 46% rostered The playing time is always an issue as the season-high is 23 minutes, and he often plays in the high teens. That\u2019s too bad because he racks up plenty of rebounds and blocks when he\u2019s on the court. Over the last three games, he\u2019s blocked 6, 3, and 3 shots while grabbing 4, 7, and 8 rebounds. A pleasant surprise has been the assists as he\u2019s dished out four in three of the last six games. Royce O\u2019Neale (SF\/PF \u2013 UTA): 33% rostered O\u2019Neale is the antithesis of sexy, as the usage rate and points are often below 10. He contributes a little something in every category, though, without hurting you anywhere. He\u2019s provided two 3-pointers in three straight games, double-digit rebounds in three of the last four games, at least two assists in eight games, and two steals in two of the last three games. Danny Green (SG\/SF \u2013 PHI): 23% rostered I feel so gross writing up Green, but here we are. The shooting efficiency will always be an issue. He\u2019s shooting 39% from the field on the season, but he\u2019s blocked at least a shot in four straight games with one game with three. He\u2019s racked up at least a steal in seven of the last eight games, with one of those a five-steal game. He\u2019s dished out four assists in two straight and will grab rebounds and contribute 3-pointers. Kenyon Martin Jr. (SF \u2013 HOU): 24% rostered Martin Jr. has played 29 and 32 minutes in the last two games. He\u2019s produced lines of 15 points, 10 rebounds, one assist, three steals, and one block while going for 13 points, one 3-pointer, nine rebounds, and three blocks in the other game. He\u2019s received the playing time because injuries and COVID-related protocols have ravaged the Rockets, in addition to P.J. Tucker being out of the rotation as the team looks to trade or buy him out. It remains to be seen what happens to Martin\u2019s role when everyone is healthy, but he should stick in the rotation. He\u2019s a high-energy player, so rebounds and defensive stats should be there regularly, which provides some semblance of a floor. Maxi Kleber (PF\/C \u2013 DAL): 19% rostered Over the last five games, Kleber has been a top 55 player. He\u2019s averaged 30.4 minutes, 10.8 points, 2.6 3-pointers, 6.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1 steal, and 0.8 blocks while shooting 51% from the field and 100% from the line (only one attempt per game). That ain\u2019t bad, especially the 3-pointers from the big man position. This waiver wire piece is so gross because it\u2019s littered with players who are so meh, but most play a ton of minutes and contribute a little something in every category. Dwight Howard (C \u2013 PHI): 26% rostered Joel Embiid is out for a few weeks, so Howard and Tony Bradley should split the center minutes. Both will provide rebounds and blocks."},{"id":511946,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jared-dudley-diagnosed-with-right-knee-injury-out-indefinitely","date":"2021-03-15","title":"Jared Dudley diagnosed with right knee injury, out indefinitely","content":"Sunday night, the Lakers offered an update on Jared Dudley, who hasn\u2019t played since March 3, when L.A. took on Sacramento before the All-Star break. \u201cIn addition to a right knee contusion, Jared Dudley has been diagnosed with a right MCL tear.

They\u2019re currently without Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, and P.J. Tucker, leaving Martin to feast in the frontcourt. In the two games since the break, KJ is averaging 14 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 2.0 blocks per game. More importantly, he\u2019s playing over 30 minutes a night while attempting 12 shots a game. All of those factors make him hard to fade at a minimum price. Ricky Rubio (MIN) $4,800 Rubio has remained below $5K on FanDuel for way too long. He\u2019s scored at least 21 FanDuel points in 15 of his last 17 games while averaging 27 fantasy points per game in that span. That makes this price tag mind-boggling, especially with Minnesota missing Jordan McLaughlin, Malik Beasley, and D\u2019Angelo Russell. We love the matchup against a 28th-ranked Portland defense, too. Kyle Lowry (TOR) $8,400 Lowry has been in these articles a ton recently, and rightfully so. Toronto is currently without Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and Fred VanVleet, leaving Lowry to feast. That\u2019s allowed him to score at least 33 FD points in nine-straight games, averaging 41 fantasy points per game in that span. That shouldn\u2019t be hard to duplicate against a Chicago team that ranks fifth in pace and 25th in points allowed. Enes Kanter (POR) $6,800 Kanter has been incredible since taking over starting center duties for Jusuf Nurkic. He\u2019s scored at least 27 FD points in 20 of his 24 starts for Nurkic, averaging over 34 FanDuel points per game in that span. That\u2019s a terrifying sign for the Wolves, as Minnesota surrenders the second-most fantasy points to opposing centers. Kevin Porter Jr (HOU) $6,000 It\u2019s hard to fade Porter right now. With all of the absences we mentioned in Houston, they\u2019re really throwing him out there to run the show. In his two starts since the break, Porter has scored at least 42 FD points in both, averaging 45 fantasy points per game. That\u2019s crazy production from someone in this price range, and he should continue to see monster usage with Houston in full-on rebuild mode. Goran Dragic (MIA) $5,300 While Dragic struggled in his first game back, he\u2019s been stellar since then. In fact, The Dragon is averaging 28.3 FD points per game across 30 minutes a night over his last six outings. That\u2019s really all you can ask for from a sub-$6K player, and he should continue to have a bigger role with Bam Adebayo expected to sit yet again. Dragic killed Orlando in their one meeting earlier this season, too, as he dropped 37 FD points in just 26 minutes. Paul George (LAC) $7,800 While PG has been struggling a bit recently, this price is silly. George has played at a $9,000 level throughout most of his career and has shown that ability most of this season. In fact, he\u2019s averaging 41 FanDuel points per game for the year, and he reached at least 39 fantasy points in 19 of his 28 games played. That should be an easy feat to reach again here, as he\u2019ll face a Pelicans team that ranks 29th in defensive efficiency. Larry Nance Jr (CLE) $5,400 I was concerned with Nance\u2019s role coming off of injury, but playing 28 minutes in his return on Friday is an extremely encouraging sign. While he failed to crack 20 FD points, Nance averaged 31.4 FD points per game in his first 15 outings before getting injured. If you get that at this price, you\u2019re off to a huge start. We don\u2019t mind that Atlanta ranks 23rd in points allowed, too, which was on full display when Nance dropped 39 FanDuel points against them earlier this year. Stanley Johnson (TOR) $3,500 We already mentioned all of the absences in Toronto, and it\u2019s forced Johnson into one of the biggest roles of his career. He has started the last two games, scoring at least 24 FD points in both of them. That\u2019s a huge total from a minimum-priced player, and one has to believe that if he can match the 37 minutes he played on Thursday, he should have another 24-point floor. Chasson Randle (ORL) $4,000 While Randle hasn\u2019t had many big games, his minutes are skyrocketing. He\u2019s now played 67 combined minutes in the two games since the All-Star break, stepping up in the absences of Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, and Evan Fournier.

The Bucks\u2019 superstar forward also became just the second player in franchise history to put up triple-doubles in back-to-back games, with NBA icon Kareem Abdul-Jabbar being the other. Westbrook, meanwhile, continues to inch closer to all-time great Oscar Robertson on the career triple-doubles list. The former Kia MVP now has 157 to his name, and needs 25 more to surpass Robertson. Harden continued his do-it-all surge for the Nets with Kevin Durant sidelined. His 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists helped Brooklyn stave off a late Detroit rally and pulled the Nets to within half a game of first-place Philadelphia.

Sure, NBA Top Shot \u2014 sort of a collectible highlight reel \u2014 is in its infancy, but Morey is all in on the frenzy stirred by digital dunks and nonfungible fast breaks. \u201cI just grabbed all the Sixers,\u201d Morey said. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have all of them because they\u2019re hard to get. But I\u2019ve got Joel (Embiid), I\u2019ve got Ben (Simmons), I\u2019ve got Tobias (Harris), I\u2019ve got (Tyrese) Maxey, I\u2019ve got (Matisse) Thybulle. \u201cSome of the players need to complain and say, \u2018Where are my highlights?\u2019\u201d Say, for example, Seth Curry. So Morey juggles answering questions over Zoom about his first season running the Philadelphia 76ers with a Top Shot search on his laptop for clips of their starting shooting guard. Morey needs patience completing his digital lineup. He can revel that the real one on the court has been about as good as it gets in the NBA. The Sixers (26-12) have the best record in the Eastern Conference headed into Sunday\u2019s game against San Antonio, the first one in Philly with fans since the coronavirus pandemic began. Morey says he can\u2019t wait to see and hear what the fans are all about. His Instagram Q&As are part of his appeal that connects him with fans and makes them feel like they\u2019re together in the championship chase. \u201cYounger fans want to feel like they\u2019re part of something,\u201d Morey told The Associated Press in an interview this week. Morey is here after 14 seasons running the Houston Rockets to make the Sixers feel like they\u2019re part of something they\u2019ve largely missed out on since 1983 \u2014 the championship conversation. Yes, that\u2019s the 48-year-old Morey fist-bumping general manager Elton Brand after big buckets and lingering in his row with the front-office team long after the final horn, but he oversees a team largely in place when he was named president of basketball operations in November. Simmons and Embiid, an MVP candidate , are the All-Star cornerstones and Harris is having a career year under Doc Rivers. Rivers, who coached the Boston Celtics to the 2008 NBA championship, in his first season in Philly has maximized the talent on a team swept out of the first round of the playoffs last season. \u201cHe really knows his stuff and does it as good or better than anything I would do if I dove in,\u201d Morey said. \u201cIt allows me to just focus on my job, which is try and get better players for him.\u201d The NBA trade deadline is March 25 and that means rumors and fantasy deals are at the forefront in Philly \u2014 the Sixers were in the mix for James Harden before he was traded to Brooklyn \u2014 and Morey said he\u2019s not necessarily pursuing a blockbuster to shake up the lineup. \u201cWe have a great group, a great chemistry, they\u2019re playing at a high level, they play even better against very good teams,\u201d Morey said. \u201cThat\u2019s something fragile and we need to respect it. Long story short, everyone expecting some big thing, I would ask them to be excited about who we have more than what\u2019s possible.\u201d The path toward a top seed in the East \u2014 already more rugged in the second half, starting with a six-game road trip later this month \u2014 cratered when Embiid went down Friday night with a bone bruise on his left knee. Embiid has 29.9 points and 11.5 rebounds in 31 games and blossomed into the rarified air of true NBA elite players. Simmons is a regular triple-double threat and Harris went from overpriced scapegoat to legitimate All-Star candidate averaging a career-best 20.2 points. Curry, a 44% career 3-point shooter, is just off that clip at 43%. The Sixers are 14th in the NBA in 3-point percentage but only 28th in total attempts. On Morey\u2019s watch, Houston averaged 45.3 3-pointers per game last season, tops in the league. \u201cWell, we happen to have the best inside players in the NBA,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how we win, just that we win. I would say our offense does need to be better. You want to be at least top 10. If you ask me, how are we going to make our offense better, it wouldn\u2019t be by shooting 3s. Joel, Tobias and Ben all are top 10 in terms of being able to score 10 feet and in, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d do anything much else. The other guys we have are good at spacing. But Ben, Joel and Tobias are so good inside, we don\u2019t need it.\u201d Morey and Rivers are both experienced at handling superstar players with supersized egos, and making sure one basketball can satiate three scorers hasn\u2019t become an issue \u2014 if it becomes an issue \u2014 quite yet. \u201cI\u2019ve found people are generally who they are by that age,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut I would say one source of tension that can come up that we are past, is that until everybody gets paid, I think there can be tension. All our main three guys are all paid, and hopefully feel well paid. They should. We\u2019re past where a lot of tension can come from that.\u201d Consider, the 26-year-old Embiid has two years left on a contract that paid him $148 million, the 24-year-old Simmons is signed through 2025 on a $170 million deal and Harris signed a $180 million max deal in 2019. Morey insists he still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s in this position and that he meant it when he said upon leaving the Rockets that he was taking a year off to spend time with his family. He joked he has texts from his two adult children wondering if they still loved him after he took the Sixers job. \u201cI feel like I want to grab my wife so she can tell you,\u201d he said, laughing. His wife recently joined him in Philadelphia \u2014 and his home is furnished now after a post showing his bachelor pad in January with just a folding chair and TV. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would say, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll add someone 10 days before the draft,\u2019\u201d Morey said. Once the Sixers called, Morey got right to work. He undid two of the 2019 major moves on draft night when he traded free-agent bust Al Horford to Oklahoma City and sent Josh Richardson to the Dallas Mavericks as part of a deal for Curry. Landing Curry in a trade seems like a breeze compared with trying to find him in Top Shot. Morey\u2019s excitement flickers out after he thought he had a lead on a highlight. \u201cAh, that\u2019s the issue, he\u2019s still on another team,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI don\u2019t want that. I want Sixers. I want the best Curry on the Sixers.\u201d Morey is almost an open book compared with his recent predecessors such as Bryan Colangelo or Sam Hinkie, who worked with Morey in Houston and was the mastermind behind Philadelphia\u2019s rebuild known as The Process. \u201cPeople always laugh and they think I\u2019m going to be like Sam or Sam\u2019s going to be like me since we worked together,\u201d Morey said. \u201cBut yeah, we\u2019re pretty different. I would say starkly different on a lot of things.\u201d His protegee got the championship ball rolling orchestrating the moves that landed them Simmons and Embiid. Morey\u2019s steadfast belief that the NBA is a superstar-driven league has him \u2014 talking to the AP before Embiid\u2019s injury \u2014 convinced he can finish the job he failed to achieve in Houston and win the championship. \u201cI definitely think we can win the title,\u201d Morey said. \u201cObviously challenging, but for sure, good enough.\u201d"},{"id":511199,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-saturday-mar-13","date":"2021-03-13","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Saturday (Mar. 13)","content":"Chris Boucher (PF \u2013 TOR) $6,700 The power forward position is a bit top-heavy in Saturday\u2019s slate, so I don\u2019t mind spending up a bit here to take a chance on Boucher\u2019s upside. The 27-year old has been seeing increased run over the last few games with Toronto dealing with several players in the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols, and that should continue in this one. Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and OG Anunoby have all been ruled out of Saturday\u2019s game, so Boucher should once again see 30+ minutes. He\u2019s averaged 40.8 FanDuel points across his last three contests. Robert Covington (PF \u2013 POR) $6,200 After a slow start to the season, Covington has really picked up the pace from a fantasy perspective. He\u2019s seeing heavy minutes and averaging 2.2 blocks, and 2.2 steals over his last four games en route to 37.8 FanDuel points over that span. As mentioned above, the power forward position is weak, and rolling out a safe option feels like the right move here. Mason Plumlee (C \u2013 DET) $6,100 Plumlee dropped 51.9 FanDuel points in his previous matchup against the Nets back in February and finds himself in a good spot once again on Saturday. While the Nets have improved as a team defensively, they still surrender the third-most FanDuel points to opposing big men this season. Jrue Holiday (PG \u2013 MIL) $6,100 It feels weird calling Holiday a value play as he\u2019s one of the more reliable fantasy options in the league, but his salary has fallen over $1,000 below his season average as the Bucks slowly reintegrate him after a long layoff. The good news is that he rejoined the starting lineup for Thursday\u2019s win over the Knicks but was limited due to the blowout. Saturday\u2019s matchup against the Wizards is currently the second-highest over-under on the slate, so Holiday should have no problem producing if Washington can keep the game close. On top of that, the Wizards will be on the second leg of a back-to-back set and already give up the eight-most FanDuel points to opposing point guards this season. Josh Richardson (SF \u2013 DAL) $4,900 The Mavericks leaned heavily on Richardson in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Thunder with Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis each sitting out for various reasons, and he responded by dropping a season-high 27 points. While his usage won\u2019t be as high with Doncic and Porzingis set to return, he should see heavy minutes in a plus matchup against the Nuggets, who are surrendering the seventh-most FanDuel points to his position this season. Richardson is a good bet to exceed the value in what should be a high-scoring affair. Danilo Gallinari (SF \u2013 ATL) $4,700 Despite being moved to the bench Thursday, Gallinari still produced 32.5 FanDuel points in 29 minutes of playing time. He finds himself in a perfect spot to produce once again on Saturday as this game currently has the highest over-under on the slate at 240, while both teams rank inside the bottom-six in defensive efficiency. On top of that, the Kings are giving up the second-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards this season, making Gallinari tough to pass up here. Brook Lopez (C \u2013 MIL) $4,700 Lopez is a boring play, but he\u2019s seen his price tag drop almost $300 from his season average on the season. Over his last two outings, the big man is averaging 3.5 blocks and 35.1 FanDuel points per game and has been gifted a matchup against the Wizards, who rank dead last in FanDuel points allowed to opposing centers. The stars are aligning for a monster game from Lopez. Devonte\u2019 Graham (SG \u2013 CHA) $4,700 This one comes with some risk, but Graham is now priced more than $1,000 less than his season average on the season. He was limited to 18 minutes in his return Thursday, but that should begin to increase as we move forward. While Toronto is a tough matchup on paper, they will be without a handful of key players due to COVID-19 protocols, making Graham an interesting option in a game with an over-under of 229.5. Saben Lee (PG \u2013 DET) $4,100 Lee\u2019s value has certainly been trending down over the last week, but he gets a boost with Dennis Smith Jr. being ruled out of Saturday\u2019s game due to COVID-19 protocols. Delon Wright did return from his injury on Thursday, but he should remain on somewhat of a minute restriction for the next couple of games. Lee has proven this season that he can produce in limited amounts of playing time, so all he needs is 20 minutes to smash his $4,100 price tag. DeAndre Bembry (SG \u2013 TOR) $4,100 Bembry has been gifted some extra playing time with a handful of Raptors stuck inside the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols, and that will be the case once again on Saturday. With Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and OG Anunoby already ruled out along with a few more rotational pieces, Bembry should once again see a hefty workload. In his first start on Thursday, he put up 25 FanDuel points in 36 minutes of action and now gets a Hornets team allowing the second-most FanDuel points per game to shooting guards this season."},{"id":510877,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/knee-injury-forces-joel-embiid-exit-vs-wizards","date":"2021-03-13","title":"Sixers' Joel Embiid out at least 2 weeks with bone bruise in left knee","content":"Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid will miss at least two weeks after suffering a bone bruise on his left knee in Friday\u2019s win over the Washington Wizards, the team announced. No structural damage was revealed following an MRI. Embiid has been a leading candidate for this season\u2019s Kia MVP award, but his delayed second-half debut was marred by a scary fall that resulted in him hyperextending his left knee. With six 1\/2 minutes to play in the third quarter, Embiid and Tobias Harris ran a two-man game on the right wing, a give-and-go screen-and-roll leaving the Sixers\u2019 center with a clear lane.

The defending NBA champions announced Friday night that Davis is making progress and has been cleared to enter the next phase of his rehabilitation after an examination by team doctors. He will be re-evaluated in late March. Davis missed his 10th consecutive game Friday when the Lakers hosted the Indiana Pacers in their first game back from the All-Star break. The All-NBA big man has Achilles tendinosis and a calf strain, and the eight-time All-Star selection was forced to drop out of last weekend\u2019s game in Atlanta. Davis missed five games earlier this season due to various injuries before aggravating his leg woes in a game in Denver on Valentine\u2019s Day. He is averaging 22.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.8 blocked shots in his 23 appearances this season. The Lakers have eight games in the next two weeks, and Davis is likely to miss all of them. Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel has said the team will be deliberately cautious with its superstar big man, hoping to get him healthy heading into the postseason. Los Angeles lost seven of its 10 games between Davis\u2019 injury and the All-Star break, but remained in third place in the Western Conference."},{"id":510785,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-thunder-trade-hamidou-diallo-to-pistons","date":"2021-03-13","title":"Thunder trade Hamidou Diallo to Pistons","content":"The Detroit Pistons acquired guard\/forward Hamidou Diallo from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for guard\/forward Svi Mykhailiuk and a future second-round pick, the team announced.

This wasn\u2019t a typical G League season and this particular run, aside from the surroundings, offered a twist: It featured the debut of the G League Ignite, a team that served as an incubator for NBA prospects who didn\u2019t want to go the college route. By all accounts, this was a hopeful and mostly successful opening 16-game experiment. As the G League president, Shareef Abdul-Rahim oversaw the operation and Rod Strickland served as program manager for a teenaged-fueled team that was half comprised of Draft-eligible players being schooled on NBA culture. This was nurtured by Brian Shaw, the former NBA player and assistant coach for the Lakers and Pacers who served as the Ignite\u2019s coach. \u2022 On NBA TV: Pacers vs. Lakers (10:30 ET) Shaw was handed the responsibility of introducing professional basketball to phenoms, showcase their skills under the close watch of league executives, and essentially preparing them for the Draft . The program gives players who normally would be one-and-done in college a chance to get paid \u2014 \u201clegally,\u201d said Shaw \u2014 and do so without going overseas (much like Charlotte Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball did a year ago in Australia). \u201cWhen you put apples to apples, this option is hard to beat,\u201d Shaw said. It\u2019s a big investment for the league and the goal is to entice future high school seniors who might see the G League as their best option. This is somewhat similar to the setup in European basketball, where some players \u2014 such as Luka Doncic \u2014 turn professional at an early age. The centerpiece of Ignite was 6-foot-6 guard Jalen Green, the MVP for Team USA during the U17 World Cup in 2018. He didn\u2019t disappoint, averaging 17.9 ppg for the Ignite with 46.1% shooting overall and 36.5% on 3-pointers. There were times, though, when Jonathan Kuminga showed more ability. The 6-foot-8 forward struggled from deep (24.6%) but sparkled almost everywhere else on the floor. Isaiah Todd and Daishen Nix also had moments of promise and, just like the others, were raw and underdeveloped in other areas. Green finished strongly with perhaps his best performance of the season: a 30-point, seven-assist, five-rebound effort in the Ignite\u2019s playoff loss to Raptors 905. Here\u2019s a Q-and-A with Shaw about the league, the players involved and how big a role Kobe Bryant played in motivating the next generation of professionals. Editor\u2019s Note: The following conversation has been condensed and edited. NBA.com: The season is over for Team Ignite, and in retrospect, what was the experience like for everyone involved, especially the teenagers? Shaw: It was smoother than expected just because of their willingness to be coached, and to have a beginner\u2019s mind, which isn\u2019t always easy to ask of and to expect from young elite players like we had. Also, we\u2019re in a pandemic and a bubble and they\u2019re 18-19 years old, away from home, with all the rules and protocol. It was really tough on them at that age. It was tough on me at 54. I don\u2019t know what it would\u2019ve been like for me at their age, to have to go through that and perform on a nightly basis for my future. I commend them for the job they did and how they were able to pivot and adapt to the circumstances, which were a challenge. There\u2019s such a generational gap between the young core of Team Ignite and the rest of the league, even the coaching staff. Or is that an overstatement? Before the tournament one of our guys put together a film of the team officials like Shareef (Abdur-Rahim) and Rod when they played in the NBA. They also put in footage of me playing. When Jalen Green saw me make a pass to Larry Bird, he immediately turned around and his eyes were wide open and said, `You played with Larry Bird?\u2019 It was a pure and innocent question, but it wasn\u2019t until that moment that it resonated with him and the other guys how long I\u2019d been around. They just don\u2019t know, and you can\u2019t blame them, because when we all played they weren\u2019t even born yet. What were typical questions they had about the NBA? They ranged from just curiosity about regular basketball situations, what do I do in this situation, how much film to watch, who had the best footwork out of the guys you worked with, what was this player\u2019s work ethic like, how important is it to lift weights. They were really all over the place. Obviously they had plenty of Kobe questions, correct? Absolutely, because they knew I played with and coached Kobe and also because that was their guy. I told them about his work ethic, his killer instinct, his footwork, which was all superior. I told them that there was no accident he was as good as he was because he put in the work. He also had the dedication and discipline not only about the game itself, but also the little things like icing his body and warming his muscles down after a workout. And the other thing Kobe did was do everything at game speed in practice, so when you get into the game it\u2019s not foreign. Do that, rather than go through the motions when you\u2019re warming up before the game. It makes all the difference, especially in the long run. There are only a handful of former great players who can still connect to the next generation \u2014 guys like Michael Jordan of course, and Allen Iverson and of course Kobe. In the case of Kobe, did he register the most of all the past greats with the teenagers? He did, and so when I wanted to get their attention, I mentioned his name quite a bit. I told them I played with him, against him and coached him. So when I said \u2018Kobe,\u2019 it got their attention right away all the time, because I was in those battles right along Kobe. With the AAU culture and the way kids are glamorized at such an early age \u2014 their highlights are on YouTube when they\u2019re just 14 in some cases \u2014 putting a structure around them when they\u2019re on the cusp of getting drafted must be, let\u2019s just say, an adventure, right? It\u2019s just the way things are. When we started training camp before coming to Orlando, I had some rules and they were non negotiable: No parents, no agents, no workout guys, no hanger-oners in our facility to watch practices. They can\u2019t live with you in your apartments, either. I did that with the purpose in mind to create some independence with them, and to block out all the outside noise that comes along with that. And I made sure the parents knew that I\u2019m a parent also. But just as I would never tell them how to raise their child, you don\u2019t tell me how to coach your child. You\u2019re turning them over to us, so trust in me I know what I\u2019m doing and I can help them get to where they want to go. I think they can see the benefit of that now. What were your impressions of Green? Oh, he\u2019s a future star, has effortless athleticism, is as competitive as they come. The young man has a high skill level. And Jonathan Kuminga? He was the most NBA-ready in terms of strength and physicality. He\u2019ll be the best two-way player in this upcoming Draft. He can make 3s, drive to the basket, finish through contact, has midrange and can defend one through four. Just a special talent. Isaiah Todd? You know, I don\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t been on everybody\u2019s radar. At 6-10 he has good size and I had him in drills with the guards. He can shoot as well as any of them from 3. He has an off-the-dribble game, a skill set that allows him to play on the perimeter and in the post. He was the energy of the team. You don\u2019t have to pump him up to get him going and he was probably the favorite teammate of everyone. I saw some of the mock Drafts and they didn\u2019t have him first or second round which makes me scratch my head. He\u2019s a first-round player. He opened a lot of eyes to his talent. Because of this test run, high school players will take notice of what happened this season with the Ignite and begin to weigh their options, which was the goal anyway. Other than a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament, does college ball offer a better advantage for 5-star players with realistic NBA aspirations? The college players started before we did this season. They were on TV first. Our guys were waiting our turn, but once the season started we were getting coverage. We also had the NBA machine behind us, fueling this whole program. Those kids can go to college if they want, but this is better preparation because of the competition we offer. I guarantee that all these teams in the G League would beat any and every college team out there, so the level of competition was high. And other advantages for Team Ignite? Our guys are getting a head start at the big boy line, the 3-point line. College has a shorter line. There\u2019s also the NBA rules, the sets, the terminology, the speed. What we offer is the same thing happening in the NBA. The college guys have to learn this later on down the line. How has this benefitted you personally? You had a successful run as an assistant coach, did some TV work, and was once a head coach with the Nuggets. Do you see yourself sticking with this, or using it as a springboard back to the NBA? I was doing NBA TV and some Warriors games on TV before I got the call to do this. This is the perfect opportunity. It has helped me in areas that were weak for me in my first go round with Denver, in terms of dealing with this generation of players and relating to them better and knowing all the things they go through. I can see myself riding this out and see wherever it takes me. I\u2019ll take it as it comes. I believe in it, the vision of it. I see a personal obligation to see this through. You don\u2019t always get these opportunities. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Following Thursday\u2019s 125-105 loss to the Sacramento Kings \u2014 Houston\u2019s 14th straight defeat \u2014 Houston coach Stephen Silas told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to figure out something that works for him and works for us as far as him not being on the team anymore.\u201d \u201cI was under the assumption that he was going to be playing tonight and he didn\u2019t play,\u201d Silas said. \u201cThat was disappointing. \u201cBefore the game I found out that he was not going to be playing. At some point there was some mutual agreement with P.J., his agent, (Rockets general manager Rafael Stone) and the organization that P.J. will not be with the team anymore.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim MacMahon were first to report the news. Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reports the Rockets are seeking a young player \u2014 as opposed to just Draft picks \u2014 in deals for Tucker. While the Rockets may want that in a trade for Tucker, other teams haven\u2019t been willing to part with that kind of asset for Tucker, per Wojnarowski and MacMahon. Tucker traveled with the Rockets to Sacramento for their game against the Kings on Thursday night but did not play and was on his way back to Houston before the game ended. Wojnarowski and MacMahon report Tucker has grown frustrated that he hasn\u2019t yet been moved to a contender and made it clear to the team he\u2019d rather sit out games until the front office finds a deal for him before the March 25 trade deadline. With Tucker, 35, averaging career lows in scoring (4.4 points) and shooting percentage (36.6), the Rockets initially planned to have Tucker come off the bench in the game against Sacramento. That would have ended Tucker\u2019s streak of consecutive regular-season starts at 216 and would have been the first time that he came off the bench since Feb. 6, 2018. He\u2019s on pace to shoot career-lows in FG% (36.6%) and 3P% (31.4%). \u201cThere is no secret it\u2019s been a rough year. He\u2019s been professional,\u201d Silas said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the lineup and trying and doing what he can but at this point we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best for the group and what\u2019s best for P.J. and that\u2019s probably not having him here.\u201d If he is traded, Tucker would be the third Houston starter from last season to be dealt away. The Rockets shipped Russell Westbrook to Washington in exchange for John Wall last December, then packaged James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a multi-team trade in January. Tucker came to the Rockets as a free agent in 2017 after previous stops with the Phoenix Suns (2012-16) and the Toronto Raptors (2006-07; 2016-17). He immediately became a starter and was known for defending opposing teams\u2019 top players. Last season, the 6-foot-5 Tucker finished as Houston\u2019s small-ball starting center as the Rockets tried to speed up the game by not using a traditional big man.

The Hawks, who trailed the Raptors by 15 with 6:13 to play, ground down the lead from there, twice pulling within three points on a closing 24-8 kick. Snell sealed it from the right wing with a clean catch-and-shoot look, holding his form the whole way through.

These additions we are announcing today will help ensure that we are doing that,\u201d said Jerry Colangelo, who has served as the managing director of the USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team since 2005. \u201cHaving a larger player pool than what we normally have is critical because of all of the uncertainties we face about availability. But for USA Basketball to receive the commitment of so many outstanding players remains an indicator of the great honor of representing your country means to these men.\u201d The USA National Team coaching staff is led by long-time San Antonio Spurs head coach  Gregg Popovich, and serving as USA assistant coaches are Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, former Atlanta Hawks head coach  Lloyd Pierce  and Villanova University head coach  Jay Wright. All told, there are 29 players who have played for the USA in an Olympics and\/or a FIBA World Cup, and together they have won 31  Olympic or FIBA Basketball World Cup gold medals and four bronze medals. The list of finalists includes nine members of the gold medalist 2016 U.S. Olympic Team, seven gold medalists from the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team and three gold medalists from the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team. Three-time Olympic medalist James (2008 and 2012 gold, 2004 bronze) could be become just the second U.S. male basketball player to make four U.S. Olympic teams (tying with Carmelo Anthony), while Durant (2012 and 2016 gold medalist) and Paul (2008 and 2012 gold medalist) are seeking to become three-time Olympians. Nine players from the gold medal winning 2016 U.S. Olympic team that went 8-0 in Rio de Janeiro remain in contention, including Barnes, Butler, DeRozan, Durant, George, Green, Irving, Jordan and Lowry. Davis, Durant, Harden, James, Love, Paul and Westbrook were members of the 2012 U.S. Olympic team that compiled an unblemished record of 8-0 and captured gold in London; while Howard, James and Paul were gold medalists with the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team. Eleven members of the USA\u2019s 2019 World Cup Team are among the 2021 finalists, including Barnes, Brown, Joe Harris, Lopez, Middleton, Mitchell, Plumlee, Tatum, Turner, Walker and White. Seven were members of the 2014 USA World Cup Team that finished 9-0 and captured gold in Spain, including Curry, Davis, DeRozan, Drummond, Harden, World Cup MVP Irving and Plumlee. Five finalists were members of the 2010 USA World Cup squad that went 9-0 and captured gold in Istanbul, Turkey, including Curry, World Cup MVP Durant, Gordon, Love and Westbrook; while Howard, James and Paul earned a bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Cup in Japan. The finalists represent 24 different NBA teams, with the Brooklyn Nets (Durant, Griffin, Harden, Joe Harris, Irving and Jordan), leading the way with six players; while the Cleveland Cavaliers (Allen, Drummond, Love and McGee), Houston Rockets (Gordon, Oladipo, Wall and Wood) and Los Angeles Lakers (Davis, Harrell, James and Kuzma) all feature four players; and the Boston Celtics (Brown, Tatum and Walker), San Antonio Spurs (Aldridge, DeRozan and White), Miami Heat (Adebayo, Butler and Duncan Robinson) and the Milwaukee Bucks (Holiday, Lopez and Middleton) each feature three players. The Detroit Pistons (Grant and Plumlee), Golden State Warriors (Curry and Green), Indiana Pacers (Brogdon and Turner), LA Clippers (George and Leonard), New Orleans Pelicans (Ingram and Williamson), New York Knicks (Randell and Mitchell Robinson), Philadelphia 76ers (Tobias Harris and Howard), Phoenix Suns (Booker and Paul), Toronto Raptors (Lowry and VanVleet), Utah Jazz (Conley and Mitchell) and Washington Wizards (Beal and Westbrook) each have two players among the 57 finalists; and represented by one player are the Atlanta Hawks (Young), Charlotte Hornets (Haywood), Chicago Bulls (LaVine), Portland Trail Blazers (Lillard) and Sacramento Kings (Barnes). Fifty-five finalists possess USA Basketball international or USA National Team experience. James leads the way with 68 games of international experience, and he is followed by Paul (50), Durant (44), Curry (40), Howard (38), Irving (33), Plumlee (31), Love (28), Westbrook (28), Tatum (26), Barnes (25), Davis (25), Harden (25), Drummond (25), Jordan (23), Green (22), Lopez (19), Turner (19), Brown (18), Walker (18), Beal (16), DeRozan (16), White (15), Gordon (14), Harrell (14), Butler (13), George (13), Joe Harris (13), Lowry (13), Middleton (13), Mitchell (13), Hayward (12), Allen (6), Conley (6), Holiday (6), Randle (6), Brogdon (5), Grant (5), Young (5), Kuzma (3), Lillard (3), Wall (3), Adebayo (1), Griffin (1), Ingram (1), Leonard (1) and Oladipo (1). Additionally, Aldridge, Booker, Tobias Harris, LaVine, McGee, Mitchell Robinson, VanVleet and Williamson have participated in previous USA National Team training camps. Only Duncan Robinson and Wood have no prior USA Basketball experience. The USA National Team\u2019s complete training schedule for 2021 will be announced at a later date."},{"id":509893,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-tnt-thursday-march-11-2021","date":"2021-03-11","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: TNT Thursday, March 11, 2021","content":"7:30 p.m. ET, TNT \u2022 Brooklyn won the first meeting of these season, 123-95 on Christmas Day , behind 37 points from Kyrie Irving \u2013 in his first game against his former team \u2014 and 29 points from Kevin Durant. Three of Irving\u2019s six highest scoring games this season have come against his former teams (37 at Boston, 37 at Cleveland on Jan. 20, 38 at Cleveland on Jan. 22). \u2022 In the first meeting, Marcus Smart was the primary defender on Irving for a team-high 4:16 and allowed 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting. Smart is expected to make his return to the Celtics after being sidelined since Jan. 30 due to a calf strain. The Celtics have gone 9-9 without Smart ; at the time of his injury he led the Celtics in assists (6.1 apg), steals (1.8 spg) and was their fourth-leading scorer (13.1 ppg). \u2022 The Nets rank second in the league in 3-point percentage as they hit 40.7% of their shots from beyond the arc. Joe Harris is a huge boost to that mark as he leads the NBA in 3-point percentage coming out of the All-Star break at 50.6%. Harris has attempted 250 3-pointers so far this season and only 59 of those attempts have come with a player within four feet of him when he took the shot. He is shooting 107-for-191 (56%) on 3-pointers when the closest defender is more than four feet away. \u2022 Boston entered the All-Star break riding a four-game win streak \u2014 tied for the longest active streak in the league \u2014 with all four wins coming at home and decided by seven points or less. Overall, the Celtics have won five straight at home , but lost six straight on the road \u2014 which is where they tip off the second half of the season Thursday in Brooklyn. The Celtics have averaged just 109.5 ppg on the road (23rd) compared to 114.2 at home (13th). The Nets lead the league in scoring regardless of location \u2014 119.0 at home (1st) and 123.3 on the road (1st). \u2022 The Nets rank second in the league in assists at 27.2 per game as they create a league-high 71.1 points per game off assists . James Harden has averaged a league-high 11.3 assists per game since joining the Nets, with Brooklyn shooting 53.1% from the field and 41.4% from 3-point range off passes from Harden. 10 p.m. ET, TNT \u2022 This matchup features two of the top-scoring benches in the league. The Clippers\u2019 bench ranks second in scoring (40.4 ppg), accounting for 35.17% of LA\u2019s total points (fifth-highest). The Warriors\u2019 bench ranks eighth in scoring (38.5 ppg), accounting for 33.95% of Golden State\u2019s total points (ninth-highest). \u2022 After winning Sunday\u2019s MTN DEW 3-Point Contest and sinking eight 3-pointers to help Team LeBron to a 170-150 win , Stephen Curry is back in action with the Warriors where he averages a league-high 4.8 3-pointers made per game on 41.1% shooting from beyond the arc. However, the Clippers hold opposing teams to 36.1% shooting on 3-pointers ( ninth-lowest ) on just 32.4 attempts per game ( sixth-lowest ). \u2022 While Curry has made more 3-pointers than any other player, the Clippers have shot the 3-pointer better than any other team \u2014 ranking first in 3-point percentage at 41.9%. Only three teams in league history have shot 41% or better from 3-point range for an entire season: the 2015-16 Warriors (41.6%), the 2009-10 Suns (41.2%) and the 1996-97 Hornets (42.8%). \u2022 The Warriors rank second in the league in pace (103.47) and fifth in the league in fast break points (14.7 ppg). In a contrast of styles, the Clippers rank 26th in both pace (98.22) and fast break points (10.3 ppg). \u2022 The Warriors and Clippers split their first two games of the season series on Jan. 6 and 8. Paul George led the Clippers with 23 points per game on 50% (14-28) shooting from the field, 53.8% (7-13) shooting on 3-pointers and 100% (11-11) at the free throw line. Stephen Curry led the Warriors at 25.5 ppg, while shooting 43.9% (18-41) from the field and 50% (10-20) from 3-point range. He shot just 8-21 (38.1%) on 2-point shots, well below his season average of 56.5%."},{"id":509908,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-thursday-mar-11","date":"2021-03-11","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Thursday (Mar. 11)","content":"Clint Capela (C \u2013 ATL) : $8,500 at TOR Toronto is missing three starters, leaving Chris Boucher and Aron Baynes to man the interior. Capela will be a nightmare for the Raptors on Thursday as they have let up 51.3 points in the paint over their last three contests. He\u2019s amassed 50+ FD points in two of his previous three games, and he has the upside for another against an inferior Toronto frontcourt. Victor Oladipo (SG \u2013 HOU) : $7,700 at SAC Oladipo is playing on the front end of this back-to-back set for Houston \u2014 so use him while you can. He\u2019s also firmly on the trade block, so Houston has more incentive to give the injury-prone journeyman some significant run versus a team that ranks last in fantasy points allowed to the SG position at 55.1 FD points per game. He had one of his best games of the season coming into this game, dropping 33\/7\/5 with two steals and two blocks versus the Nets. Roll with Oladipo, especially when he\u2019s only competing with John Wall for shots. Norman Powell (SF \u2013 TOR) : $7,500 vs. ATL With the Raptors shorthanded, expect Powell to step up on offense. When Siakam, VanVleet and Anunoby are off the the floor, Powell\u2019s usage goes up by 6.1% while scoring 4.3 more FanDuel points. He\u2019s gone over 38 FD points in his last three games and he\u2019s a good bet to eclipse that mark yet again. Jerami Grant (PF \u2013 DET) : $7,300 at CHA Grant has seen a slight dip in his performance over the last five games, averaging 34.5 FD points compared to 38.6 FD points throughout the season. However, the Hornets are the perfect formula for a course correction, allowing the most points to opposing SFs this season with 54.5 FD points per contest. Despite being listed at PF in FanDuel, take advantage of the fact that he is actually a small forward that should ball out in this road matchup. Richaun Holmes (C \u2013 SAC) : $6,800 vs. HOU No Christian Wood. No Hassan Whiteside. Holmes is averaging 31 minutes over his past five contests and provides a shade under 5x value over that span (4.9). The Rockets surrender the eighth-most points to the center position this season, which bodes well for Holmes\u2019 outlook as a value play. Lonzo Ball (PG- NOP) : $6,600 vs. MIN Ball\u2019s salary fell by $300 since March 3rd. However, he\u2019s been accumulating close to 5x value in his previous five games. The Pelicans project to score 123 points and Minnesota is the worst team in the league, record-wise. That gives him the upside to score between 36 and 49 FD points in a favorable matchup. Shake Milton (PG \u2013 PHI) : $4,200 at CHI Some might assume Tobias Harris will be the greatest beneficiary of Embiid and Simmons being out of the lineup. But it\u2019s Shake Milton. He has the highest usage rate with the All-Stars off the floor, seeing an uptick in usage by 7.1 percent. He\u2019s been delivering close to 6x value in his last five games, making him a viable option against the Bulls. Nicolas Claxton (C \u2013 BKN) : $4,000 vs. BOS The young center reached double-figures in his last two contests, scoring 16 and 17 points, respectively. More importantly, he\u2019s averaging 1.36 FD points per minute with a 21.6 usage rate. That\u2019s a bit absurd considering his teammates are James Harden and Kyrie Irving. At only $4K, he\u2019s well worth the investment against a Boston frontcourt that\u2019s been mediocre at best. Dwight Howard (C \u2013 PHI) : $3,800 at CHI Howard\u2019s nearly averaged a double-double in four starts this season, averaging 8.3 ppg with 9.0 rpg. Embiid\u2019s absence allows Howard to see a healthy dose of minutes against a weak frontcourt. Howard has issues getting into foul trouble, but he should be an excellent cheap option if he can stay on the floor. Precious Achiuwa (SF \u2013 MIA) : $3,500 vs. ORL Bam Adebayo will sit this one out, allowing for Achiuwa to get more run for the Heat. When Adebayo missed two games earlier this season, the rookie averaged 13.5 ppg, 12.5 rpg and 2.5 apg. Kelly Olynyk will be a popular play tonight, but Achiuwa has more upside to produce relative to his salary."},{"id":509772,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/erik-spoelstra-meyers-leonards-words-were-distasteful-and-hurtful","date":"2021-03-11","title":"Erik Spoelstra: Meyers Leonard's words were 'distasteful and hurtful'","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Meyers Leonard\u2019s coach and Miami Heat teammates offered no excuse Wednesday for his use of an anti-Semitic slur while livestreaming a video game earlier this week , nor did they make any effort to hide their disappointment in him in their first public comments about the incident. \u201cHe said something that was extremely distasteful and hurtful,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re left with the aftermath of that.\u201d Leonard\u2019s use of the slur began circulating widely on social media Tuesday afternoon. Within a few hours, he apologized, the NBA opened an investigation and the Heat announced that he will be away from the team indefinitely. His season was already over because of a shoulder injury; it\u2019s not a stretch to say his Heat tenure may be over as well. \u201cThere are consequences to words,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd those were extremely hurtful words.\u201d The Heat went back to work Wednesday to end their All-Star break.

Spoelstra has spoken with Leonard, as have other team officials. \u201cMeyers has been a really good teammate,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good human being.\u201d Leonard issued a public apology, saying he did not know what the slur he was using meant. The NBA is investigating and could fine or suspend Leonard when that probe is completed. \u201cWe can\u2019t tolerate that here,\u201d Heat captain and 18-year veteran Udonis Haslem said of the usage of the slur. \u201cRight is right and wrong is wrong. And since I\u2019ve been here in this organization, to the day I leave this organization and beyond, we\u2019re going to try to be on the right side of everything \u2014 especially issues like this.\u201d Haslem was asked if Leonard ever used language around him that was offensive. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Haslem said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him use any language that made me uncomfortable at all.\u201d The video drew reactions from league officials, members of other teams, celebrities and even athletes from other sports. New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who has openly embraced his Jewish heritage, posted a letter to Leonard on social media and said he did so to offer perspective. Edelman also said he is in Miami often, and invited Leonard to meet for a Shabbat dinner with friends. \u201cI get the sense that you didn\u2019t use that word out of hate, more out of ignorance,\u201d Edelman wrote. \u201cMost likely, you weren\u2019t trying to hurt anyone or even profile Jews in your comment. That\u2019s what makes it so destructive. When someone intends to be hateful, it\u2019s usually met with great resistance. Casual ignorance is harder to combat and has greater reach, especially when you command great influence.\u201d Spoelstra has offered high praise for Leonard\u2019s work ethic and effort many times during the 7-foot center\u2019s year and a half with the team. Those days seem long ago now. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter the intent,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right.\u201d"},{"id":509610,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/durant-still-out-for-nets-who-will-be-cautious-with-griffin","date":"2021-03-11","title":"Kevin Durant (hamstring) remains out as Nets await Blake Griffin's debut","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant will remain out for the rest of this week and it is unclear when he will return to the Brooklyn Nets lineup, meaning he will miss more than a month with a strained left hamstring. Blake Griffin also will be sidelined when the Nets open the second half Thursday against Boston ( 7:30 ET, TNT ), though he stressed he\u2019s not injured. He and the Nets think it\u2019s smart to take their time increasing his workload after signing Monday. Durant hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 13 at Golden State. The Nets hoped at first the injury wouldn\u2019t be serious, but announced on Feb. 26 that a follow-up MRI showed a clearer picture of the injury and would keep Durant sidelined through the All-Star break. \u201cI think when we got the second scan we knew this was going to be longer,\u201d coach Steve Nash said Wednesday. \u201cThe first scan there was bleeding and the imaging wasn\u2019t as clear. So I think we realized the second scan that this was type of timeline we were looking at and we\u2019ll see, that could change. But we were expecting the potential for this to be a month or whatever it may be.\u201d Nash added that Durant will have another scan of the injury next week. He said the All-Star forward has been on the court doing individual shooting but unable to do full-court running drills, and the Nets want to see appropriate healing when they review the injury again. \u201cSo who knows?\u201d Nash said. \u201cWho knows what the scan says, who knows where this takes us and how soon he\u2019s back, but I think when we got the second scan we knew that this was probably what we were looking at.\u201d Durant returned this season after missing all last season while recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured right Achilles tendon. Nash said the Nets don\u2019t believe the injury to the opposite hamstring came from overcompensating for the injury suffered in the 2019 NBA Finals. \u201cThrough his history, through medical history and assessments, we don\u2019t feel like those two are related at all,\u201d Nash said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing very well right now and we all feel very positive about the direction he\u2019s going, but we just need to be vey cautious because he\u2019s a really important player for us.\u201d Griffin hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 12, sitting out the rest of his time with the Detroit Pistons before agreeing to a buyout last Friday.

If no trades are worked out, the team could simply buy Aldridge out and let him sign elsewhere as a free agent. \u201cLaMarcus is not with the team,\u201d Popovich said before the Spurs played the Dallas Mavericks. \u201cHe\u2019s healthy, in that respect, but we\u2019ve mutually agreed to work out some opportunities for him and that\u2019ll be elsewhere. So, he won\u2019t be with the team moving forward.\u201d The 35-year-old Aldridge was in his sixth season with the Spurs after playing his first nine NBA seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers.

Smart said he felt good after practicing with the team Wednesday and that he has been cleared to return for the Celtics\u2019 matchup with the Nets after missing the past 18 games with a torn left calf. \u201cAs of right now I will be playing and attending the game tomorrow,\u201d he said. Coach Brad Stevens said Smart\u2019s return should provide an instant lift. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that knows how to play, plays both ends of the court and makes us better on both ends of the court,\u201d Stevens said. Boston would have had its full roster available for the first time all season Thursday, but Romeo Langford, who hasn\u2019t played this season following wrist surgery, has been placed in the league\u2019s health and safety protocol and won\u2019t travel with the team to Brooklyn. Stevens said Langford has been cleared to resume playing and would have been available if he hadn\u2019t been placed in the protocol. Still, Stevens said he\u2019s looking forward to the matchup with the Nets. \u201cIt will be a great litmus test to see where we stand, because I think they are clearly the team that is going to be very difficult for teams to beat,\u201d he said. Smart has been the engine of the Celtics\u2019 defense for most of his seven seasons in Boston and the team struggled on that end of the floor without him, going 9-9 and allowing opponents to shoot 46.5% and average 112.5 points over that stretch. He said it\u2019s been frustrating to watch that decline from the sideline with no ability to affect it. \u201cEspecially when you know how good of a defensive team we can be \u2014 that we are,\u201d Smart said. \u201cAnd for me, being a defensive guy, it is tough. But being over there I have to look at it from a different perspective. When everybody else is looking at the negatives about it I\u2019m looking at the positives.\u201d What he sees are things that can be fixed and that the Celtics can control with their effort. \u201cAnd what I have to do to bring back the defensive energy for us,\u201d Smart said. He\u2019ll get his opportunity right out of the gate. Brooklyn, which has the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, is averaging a league-best 121.1 points. Utah, which visits Boston on Tuesday, is third in the league with 116.6 points per contest. Both teams have dynamic scorers. Smart will almost certainly spend time guarding them. That could prove to be a challenging proposition considering that Smart\u2019s first true chance to play 5-on-5 since his injury occurred during Tuesday\u2019s practice session. It\u2019s why he will have a minutes\u2019 restriction for at least a few games, Stevens said. But Smart said he isn\u2019t too concerned about aggravating the injury and has been doing focused workouts to strength the muscle and guard against a recurrence. \u201cFor me it\u2019s always been like that, any type of injury that I\u2019ve had,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWhen you go in thinking about it and worrying about it \u2026. you can\u2019t think like that. Because once you start thinking about that you start allowing that negativity to get in \u2014 that doubt \u2014 and things start going wrong for you. \u201cYou have to trust your body.

He was 83. Tait had recently gone into hospice care following a lengthy batter with kidney disease and liver cancer. \u201cA friend and mentor to many over the years, Joe Tait wasn\u2019t just a member of the Cavaliers family; he was a part of the Cavs story like no one else and his voice and unique, candid perspective reverberates throughout the team\u2019s history,\u201d the Cavs said in a statement . \u201cHe will be dearly missed.\u201d Tait was with the NBA team from its inception in 1970 until he retired in 2011, calling over 3,000 games. In his final season, the Cavs honored Tait with a commemorative banner that hangs alongside some of the team\u2019s retired jersey numbers in the rafters of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Sometimes a little gruff when he didn\u2019t agree with a referees\u2019 call, Tait also had several signature sayings like \u201cWham with the right hand!\u201d following a dunk. \u201cJoe was also famous for his dry wit and his pragmatic view of life and probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted a big, sentimental sendoff,\u201d the Cavs said. \u201cSo, to paraphrase the legend, himself \u2013 Let\u2019s not say: \u2018goodbye.\u2019 Let\u2019s just say: \u201cHave a GOOD night, everybody!\u2019\u201d Tait was there in the good and bad years for the Cavs and he finally made it to the NBA Finals as LeBron James led Cleveland to its first appearance in 2007. James expressed his condolences in a Twitter posting. \u201cRest In Paradise my friend!!\u201d James wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll be extremely missed here!\u201d Tait did radio and TV play-by-play for the Cleveland Indians for 16 seasons. He also called games for the WNBA\u2019s Cleveland Rockers, Cleveland Crusaders hockey and Mount Union football. Among Tait\u2019s more memorable calls was the Cavs\u2019 \u201cMiracle in Richfield\u201d run in the 1975-76 playoffs, when Cleveland rallied to knock off Washington. He also handled Len Barker\u2019s perfect game in 1981. \u201cThank you, Joe, for the decades of joy you have brought Cleveland sports fans,\u201d the Indians said in a posting. Tait was born in Evanston, Illinois. He began his radio career at Monmouth College (Illinois) before graduating in 1959. He had planned to be a writer, but changed his career course after a professor sent him to record a basketball game and heard his call. Tait also served three years in the Army. He was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame media wing in 2010. There were no immediate information on services.

(March 10, 2021) \u2013 The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced today the winners of the 2020 Mannie Jackson \u2013 Basketball\u2019s Human Spirit Award. Honored for their decades-long commitment to social justice, the 2020 award recipients are Wayne Embry, George Raveling and Bill Russell. The winners will be formally recognized in May 2020 during Hall of Fame Enshrinement Weekend at Mohegan Sun. \u201cThe Basketball Hall of Fame is proud to recognize Wayne Embry, George Raveling, and Bill Russell as the 2020 Mannie Jackson Award recipients,\u201d said John L. Doleva, President and CEO of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cThese gentlemen have long been recognized for their impact on the game as players, coaches and executives, but it is equally important for us to celebrate them for their work as social justice trailblazers who paved their own way and created countless opportunities for others.\u201d Established in 2007, the Mannie Jackson \u2013 Basketball\u2019s Human Spirit Award honors individuals who have found the game of basketball to be a contributing aspect of their personal growth and accomplishment, a place to develop an understanding of others and an avenue that has helped shape his or her growth into a recognized visionary leader. Winners must reflect the values of Mannie Jackson\u2019s life-long mission to overcome obstacles and challenge the status quo, while taking responsibility for his or her actions and seeking the highest standard of excellence. Embry, Raveling and Russell were chosen from a large candidate pool that represents every level of basketball and is reviewed annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Mr. Jackson. The winner recognition process was paused in 2020 due to the global pandemic and two sets of winners are expected to be recognized in the 2021 calendar year. \u201cA Hall of Fame should recognize great athletes, but also the great people who are in athletics and are doing extraordinary things for the world around them,\u201d said Mannie Jackson, the Award\u2019s namesake. \u201cThe men we are honoring today have been faced with tremendous adversity in their lives, challenging status quos and striving for equality and opportunities for all. Basketball players, coaches and fans are all indebted to these men for the work they\u2019ve done to make basketball the unifying game it is today.\u201d Jackson has served as a positive example and role model to his peers, in addition to his tremendous business success. A former star for the Harlem Globetrotters, Jackson served as a senior executive for Honeywell Inc. during the 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s and saved the Globetrotters from near extinction in 1993 when he purchased the team. In doing so, Mannie Jackson became the first Black owner of a major international sports and entertainment organization. In a short period of time, Jackson revived the organization and led the Globetrotters to record attendance and revenue growth while expanding the influence of the Globetrotters to more than 118 countries. Under Jackson\u2019s watch, the Globetrotters charitable contributions totaled over $15 million and in 2002 the Harlem Globetrotters were elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2012, Jackson penned his bestselling autobiography, \u201cBoxcar To Boardrooms \u201d and continues to donate generously to numerous causes including the University of Illinois, South African youth funds, cancer research and the Basketball Hall of Fame. He is also active in promoting the mission of the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities located in his hometown Edwardsville, Illinois, while serving as the Center\u2019s lead investor. He was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. Wayne Embry \u2013 Wayne Embry is a revolutionary sports executive, as the first Black General Manager in the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1972 and the first Black President of any professional sports team. He has been a prominent community activist and mentor in each city where he has lived and worked, while also serving as a board member and leader to numerous non-profits, including the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Miami University and USA Basketball. Embry has been honored with Miami University\u2019s Distinguished Achievement Medal (2001), the Ohio Heritage Award for his contributions to the state (2013) and the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Wayne Embry Fellowship Program. Embry has been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (1999), the Ohio College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006) and the Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame (2013). George Raveling \u2013 George Raveling is a civil rights pioneer dating back to the day he stood on the steps next to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Raveling was the first Black coach hired by the Atlantic Coast Conference and the first Black head coach in the Pac 12. He is a vocal advocate for the Black Coaches Association and a tremendous mentor to many administrators, coaches and players. For more than 20 years, he has served as Nike\u2019s Global Ambassador for the game, while also serving on the boards of USA Basketball, the NABC, the NCAA and the Basketball Hall of Fame\u2019s Board of Governors. Raveling has been inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2013) and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (2015), as well as the Washington State, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Villanova and Black Coaches Association Halls of Fame. Bill Russell \u2013 Bill Russell led the Boston Celtics to 11 NBA championships, and while his athletic achievements are astonishing, he has also been a prominent civil rights activist for more than half a century. As both a player and coach, he experienced countless racial injustices including segregation and mistreatment rooted in bigotry. He has always been vocal about his experiences and in 1963 he participated in the March on Washington. In 1966, he became the first Black head coach in major professional sports and in 1968 he became the first Black head coach to win an NBA championship. Russell is a recipient of the NBA\u2019s National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award (2006) and the ESPY\u2019s Arthur Ashe Courage Award (2019). Russell has been inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006) and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (1975). In 2010, President Obama awarded Russell the highest civilian honor, The Presidential Medal of Freedom.

What it does mean is that, given the tiny sampling of performances from last week\u2019s Ladder to now, we\u2019re changing things up for a week. First, the 10 players who held rungs on the most recent Ladder are back, Some shifting up or down, yes, but nobody fell off based on a poor performance when most rookies played two, one or zero games. Second, this gap weeks offers an opportunity to highlight some NBA newcomers who cracked the Top 10 for maybe a cameo appearance or two in the season\u2019s first half or didn\u2019t earn a spot at all. After all, this is more of a stepladder than some heavy-duty extension job wielded by the local fire department. There are but 10 rungs in a season with at least double that number of notable rookies. So we\u2019ll get to the latest Ladder below. Meanwhile, here in alphabetical order are some rookies that might make the Ladder more competitive, even crazy, as the second half of 2020-21 plays out (season stats in parentheses): \u2022 Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat ( 6.1 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 0.6 apg ): High-octane reserve forward has two great \u201chustle\u201d mentors in Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler. \u2022 Deni Avdija, Washington Wizards ( 5.9 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 1.3 apg ): Wizards have been playing the long game with Avdija, with ups and downs in minutes. His versatility is terrific. \u2022 Facundo Campazzo, Denver Nuggets ( 5.5 ppg, 1.0 rpg, 2.1 apg ): A slick passing guard who makes himself a pest defensively. \u2022 Saben Lee, Detroit Pistons ( 7.1 ppg, 1.5 rpg, 2.3 apg ): His climb up the Pistons\u2019 depth chart has been as assertive as his drives into the paint. \u2022 Kira Lewis Jr, New Orleans Pelicans ( 5.2 ppg, 0.8 rpg, 1.8 apg ): Inconsistent minutes but the lottery pick\u2019s speed and talent have been apparent in flashes, and the Pelicans are 4-3 when he plays enough to dish three or more assists. \u2022 Theo Maledon, Oklahoma City Thunder ( 7.8 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.3 apg ): Been starting at guard for six weeks, with more consistency, including 40% shooting from arc, 2.1 assists\/turnover ratio. \u2022 Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers ( 8.0 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 1.8 apg ): Maxey\u2019s production has been in a long, slow decline, but any COVID-related layoff for Ben Simmons could mean a heavy dose of minutes and opportunity. \u2022 Jaden McDaniels, Minnesota Timberwolves ( 5.1 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 1.0 apg ): Do the math \u2013 the Wolves have a minus-8.4 net rating per NBA.com stats, but McDaniels is their best individually at minus-2.7. \u2022 Chuma Okeke, Orlando Magic ( 4.4 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.0 apg ): All the way back from knee issues, the forward has endeared himself to teammates on and off the floor. \u2022 Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics ( 7.7 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.3 apg ): Already with a vociferous fan club, the feisty reserve guard has scored 10-plus 10 times, with the Celtics 7-3 on those nights. \u2022 Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons ( 5.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.7 apg ): NBA fans in Motown love centers with big motors and Stewart is the latest. \u2022 Xavier Tillman, Memphis Grizzlies ( 7.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 1.7 apg ): Forward stepped into the void of Jaren Jackson Jr.\u2019s knee injury. \u2022 Obi Toppin, New York Knicks ( 4.7 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 0.6 apg ): After a spotty first half and rough learning curve, Toppin might be able to use his Slam Dunk Contest participation as a reset and confidence boost. \u2022 Dylan Windler, Cleveland Cavaliers ( 6.3 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.3 apg ): His shot needed fixing heading into the break but the Cavs love his cuts and floor-spacing on the wing. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, March 8) Season stats : 15.8 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 6.3 apg Since last Ladder: 19.0 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 5.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 1 Looking like a runaway favorite for the Kia Rookie of the Year award, barring injury or some wild burst of magnificence by one of Ball\u2019s rivals below. In his one game over the past week, Charlotte\u2019s 33-point abuse of the Timberwolves in Minnesota, the Hornets\u2019 playmaker\u2019s biggest number was his plus-25 in 26:21. Season stats : 12.2 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.4 apg Since last Ladder: 13.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 3 It\u2019s one thing to get named to a roster spot for a game that never happened (the 2021 Rising Stars affair, normally a perennial for All-Star weekend). It\u2019s quite another to not get invited at all. If that happened with a party that was never held, it still might irritate you, right? Just more fuel for Quickley\u2019s motor, perhaps. The Knicks guard tops all rotation rookies (at least 15 minutes per game) with a 27.4% usage rate. Season stats : 14.9 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.5 apg Since last Ladder: 19.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 4 No first-year player is jacking up more shots, overall and from 3-point land, in spite of his 37.1% and 30.5% inaccuracy, respectively. That includes a 1-of-10 from the arc against Charlotte, in which he also had four turnovers and got tagged with a minus-24 in Minnesota\u2019s ninth consecutive loss. Season stats : 13.2 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 5.4 apg Since last Ladder: DNP  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 2 The Kings were playing it safe with Haliburton heading into the break, giving his sore calf a couple extra days rather than rushing him back. That\u2019s why he has missed Sacramento\u2019s past four games, during which it went 2-2, and that\u2019s why Haliburton slid a couple of rungs on this week\u2019s Ladder. There still is some clamoring among Kings fans to move him into the starting lineup based on his first-half production, but first Haliburton has to get out of the trainer\u2019s room. Season stats : 9.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.1 apg Since last Ladder: 10.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 5 The Detroit rookie\u2019s game inside the arc is starting to perk up. In December and January, he actually shot worse on 2-point attempts (32.4%) than he did on 3-pointers (36.3%). But Bey boosted both those numbers in February, most notably his ability to convert from closer in (53.8% on twos), while hitting 44.4% of the deep balls. 6. Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Houston Rockets Season stats : 9.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 1.7 apg Since last Ladder: 12.0 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 6 Racked up a double-double (12 points, 10 rebounds) vs. Brooklyn. 7. James Wiseman, Golden State Warriors Season stats : 11.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 0.7 apg Since last Ladder: 8.5 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 7 More productive at home than on road, common for rookies. 8. Patrick Williams, Chicago Bulls Season stats : 10.2 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.2 apg Since last Ladder: 13.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 8 Butting heads with Zion gave him and the Bulls extra confidence. 9. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats : 9.6 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.4 apg Since last Ladder: 7.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 0.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 9 Of 28 rookies averaging 15-plus minutes, leads in net rating (5.2). 10. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers Season stats : 8.1 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 1.9 apg Since last Ladder: 7.0 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 10 Needs to get to the line more while working on outside shoot. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Westbrook has outscored Beal in their last two games, and he has hit 5x value against this price in all but two of his last eight outings. In contrast, Beal has hit 5x value in just half of those eight games. You should expect a lot of points in this one, and that makes Westbrook an excellent investment. Kristaps Porzingis (PF \u2013 DAL) at SAS $8,300  Porzingis posted 41.1 FD points against the Spurs back in late January, which is good for 5x value against this price. The matchup isn\u2019t fantastic here, as San Antonio has done a good job of limiting opposing bigs. Still, Porzingis\u2019 floor makes him worth the price \u2014 especially since power forward is relatively thin tonight. Jonas Valanciunas (C \u2013 MEM) vs. WAS $7,000  Valanciunas is the best value at center tonight. He is only $500 more expensive than Jakob Poeltl, but he takes on the Wizards, who give up the second-most FanDuel points per game (FDPPG) to the position. Valanciunas has posted some disappointing results of late and that\u2019s led to a downtick in his salary, but I would buy the dip tonight. Also, who else are you going to use at center? After Poeltl, you\u2019re down to Alex Len ($4,500) or Robin Lopez ($4,200). No thanks. Dillon Brooks (SG \u2013 MEM) vs. WAS $5,600  Yes, I\u2019m aware that Brooks\u2019 teammate, De\u2019Anthony Melton, has been lighting people up recently. So is FanDuel. That\u2019s why Melton will cost you $6,000 tonight. Brooks is a much better investment \u2014 not only is he cheaper, but he has also averaged more minutes over the last three games. More importantly, he has hit 5x in two of the three games Grayson Allen has missed with his concussion. LaMarcus Aldridge (PF \u2013 SAS) at DAL $5,500  I don\u2019t love Aldridge tonight, but he did look excellent against the Mavericks when these teams last met. He posted 41.8 FD points, good for 7.6x value against this price. While the Spurs have moved away from him in recent weeks, Aldridge is quite affordable for someone we\u2019ve already seen succeed against his opponent. Jalen Brunson (PG \u2013 DAL) vs. SAS $5,400  Brunson has hit 5x value against this price in his last two games. Sure, one of those came without Luka Doncic, but his best performance came with Doncic still in the lineup! Brunson also hit 5x value against the Spurs earlier in the year, too, so I have faith in him as a value option at point guard. Justise Winslow (SF \u2013 MEM) vs. WAS $4,800  Winslow deserves a bit more respect here. He may have only posted 17.3 FD points against the Wizards when these teams last met on Mar. 2, but he had hit 5x value against this price in the game prior. The Wizards give up the second-most FDPPG to small forwards, where Winslow spends most of his minutes, and he makes a strong boom-or-bust play at this salary. Deni Avdija (SF \u2013 WAS) at MEM $4,000  Avdija posted 17.9 FD points against the Wizards on Mar. 2, and he followed that up by posting 18.4 FD points against the Clippers two days later. That\u2019s not jaw-dropping production, but it was good enough for him to average 4.5x value through the two-game stretch. While that\u2019s a bit below what I usually look for on FanDuel, tonight\u2019s small slate makes Avdija worth a dart throw. Patty Mills (SG \u2013 SAS) at DAL $4,000  Mills has only hit 5x value once over his last five outings, but he also hit at least 4.5x value in all but one of those games. That makes him a reliable floor play. Mills almost always scores between 18 and 20 FD points, so if you need a stopgap at guard in cash contests, he\u2019s your guy. Desmond Bane (SG \u2013 MEM) vs. WAS $3,500  Bane sits at the site minimum on tonight\u2019s slate. That usually wouldn\u2019t be odd, but with so few alternatives, the fact that he hit 5x value in one of the three games without Grayson Allen has some significance. That 34.9-FD point performance against the Rockets points to enough value for me to consider him tonight."},{"id":509481,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/schedule-analysis-2nd-half-of-2020-21-season","date":"2021-03-10","title":"Schedule analysis: 2nd half of 2020-21 season","content":"With the All-Star break coming to an end on Wednesday, the NBA begins what will be a jam-packed, 10-week journey toward the 2021 postseason.

It\u2019s a 72-game season, with each team playing two games against each of the 15 teams in the opposite conference and three games against each of the other 14 teams within its own conference. (15 x 2) + (14 x 3) = 72 2. The top six teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. Teams 7-10 qualify for a three-game play-in tournament, where the seventh and eight-place teams play for the No. 7 seed. The loser of that game would then play the winner of a game between the ninth and 10-place teams for the final playoff spot. The Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs are the teams with the most work remaining, each scheduled to play 40 games over the next 68 days. They\u2019re the only two teams without any two-day breaks, and they each have 11 back-to-backs over the next 10 weeks. Both teams have more road games than home games to play. The Grizzlies have one of the three longest road trips of the second-half schedule, seven games over 11 days from April 16-26. The last six games of that trip are against teams \u2014 Milwaukee, Denver (x 2), Portland (x 2) and the Clippers \u2014 with winning records. And the end of that trip is the start of a stretch where the Grizzlies are playing 16 games over the last 22 days of the season. One positive for the Grizzlies is that they have a league-high 14 games against teams that played the day before. Despite their own 11 back-to-backs, they have more *rest-advantage games (8) than rest-disadvantage games (5) over the next 10 weeks and if games are played as scheduled, they\u2019ll finish with the league\u2019s biggest differential (14 vs. 6). Alas, they\u2019re only 2-4 in rest-advantage games thus far. * Rest advantage = Didn\u2019t play the day before. Opponent is playing the second game of a back-to-back. Rest disadvantage = Playing the second game of a back-to-back. Opponent didn\u2019t play the day before. In the first half, teams were 78-61 (.561) in rest-advantage games, 46-31 at home and 32-30 on the road. The Spurs have one of the longest homestands of the second half, nine games over 15 days from March 22 through April 5. But that\u2019s preceded by a five-game trip and followed by a stretch where they\u2019re playing 17 of 22 on the road with seven back-to-backs. After that 22-game stretch, their remaining schedule is just a two-game series at home against the Suns. One positive is that the Spurs\u2019 have five two-game series (most in the league) to help reduce travel over the next 10 weeks. But the Spurs don\u2019t just have one of busiest second-half schedules. They have the second toughest in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage. Only half (20) of their 40 games are against the other 13 teams that come out of the break with winning records, but 13 of those 20 are against the upper half of that group (the seven teams over .600). They still have to play all three of their games against the Suns, along with two each against the Clippers, Bucks and Sixers. Eight of those 13 are in the Spurs\u2019 last 10 games of the season , a stretch that also includes a game against the Blazers. The Spurs are playing seven games in the last 10 days of the season, a stretch that takes them from the West Coast to the East Coast and then back home. The Spurs come out of the break in seventh place in the West, in good position to get back to the postseason after seeing their 22-year playoff streak come to an end last season. Given how tough their remaining schedule is, climbing back into the top six (where they\u2019d avoid the play-in) or just remaining in the top eight (where they\u2019d only have to win one play-in game) will be difficult.

Coming out of the break, the Milwaukee Bucks are in third place, two games behind the first place Philadelphia 76ers and a game and a half behind the Brooklyn Nets . The Bucks have the toughest remaining schedule of the three teams at the top of the East. But one reason for that is the five games they have against the other two. So, while they\u2019re playing from behind and have the toughest road ahead, the Bucks control their own destiny. The No. 1 seed for a third straight season is certainly within reach. Plus, the Bucks will play all five of those games against Philly and Brooklyn at home or with a rest advantage. Next Wednesday (March 17), they\u2019re in Philadelphia, with the Sixers having played the Knicks the night before. On April 22 and 24, the Bucks will host the Sixers in a two-game series, playing with another rest advantage in the first game. And on May 2 and 4, the Nets will be in Milwaukee for another two-game series. The Bucks\u2019 remaining schedule is East-heavy (23 of 36 within the conference). But they have a big, six-game trip (March 29 \u2013 April 8) through the West that begins with two games in L.A. and includes visits to Portland, Golden State and Dallas. They\u2019re currently 5-5 against the nine West teams with winning records. The Sixers also have a two-game stop in L.A., facing the Lakers and Clippers on March 25 and 27. That\u2019s part of a stretch (that ends with their two-game series in Milwaukee) where they\u2019re played 13 of 18 games against teams that are currently over .500. But when they leave Milwaukee, only one of their final 12 games (May 2 in San Antonio) is against a team that comes out of the break with a winning record. The Sixers have eight rest-disadvantage games, with two of those against the Bucks, as noted above. That first meeting with the Bucks (at home) is the end of a stretch of five games in seven nights to start the second-half schedule. They have another five-in-seven stretch in May, starting with that visit to San Antonio. The Nets are one of two teams (the Knicks are the other) without any stretches of five games in seven nights. They also have the East\u2019s easiest schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage. But if you\u2019re looking for a stretch of that will test the Nets\u2019 26th-ranked defense, take their 11 games from April 20 through May 8. Eight of those 11 games (including their two games in Milwaukee against the second-ranked Bucks) will be against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency . Two of the other three are against the 12th-ranked Celtics and 13th-ranked Mavs, teams that could certainly be ranked higher by then.

The Earned Edition uniforms celebrate the 16 franchises, with team names or logos prominently emblazoned on the front of the uniforms and featuring current team design elements, brought to life through enhanced franchise colors. The designs across each uniform amplify the iconic elements that are ingrained in the fabric of each organization. As an added nod to the 2020 NBA Playoff teams and their pursuit of an NBA championship, 15 of the uniforms are adorned with special silver insignias including a silver Nike swoosh on the top left front of the uniforms; a silver Earned Edition jocktag on the bottom right front; and a silver NBA logo on the back, above the player\u2019s name. Each pair of shorts additionally features a silver Nike swoosh and silver Nike logo as well. The Earned Edition uniform for the 2020 NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers stands alone with these marks decorated in gold to honor the NBA Championship the team earned in Orlando, Fla. at the conclusion of a historic NBA season. With the second half of the NBA season tipping off tonight, the Dallas Mavericks will be the first team to display their new designs on court as they take on the San Antonio Spurs at 8:30 p.m. ET on NBA TV. The remaining teams will begin debuting their Earned Edition uniforms later this week. Fans can visit NBA LockerVision for a preview on when teams will wear their Earned Edition uniforms throughout the remainder of the season.

The NBA returns Wednesday with a pair of games: Washington at Memphis and San Antonio at Dallas. Another 21 teams start their second-half slates on Thursday, and the five remaining teams get back on the court Friday. Here\u2019s 10 things to know about what\u2019s happening, what might happen and what to watch the rest of the way: Home teams have gone 285-248 this season, a .535 winning percentage. It\u2019s on pace to be the lowest in NBA history. The record in that department is .551, set last season \u2014 and it was trending that way even before the pandemic. The bubble and playing the final 88 regular-season games without fans had nothing to do with that change; in fact, \u201chome\u201d teams in the bubble won 56% of their games at Walt Disney World. But this year, teams believe the lack of fans factors into home-court advantage not meaning much. Plus, road teams are getting more rest than usual \u2014 they\u2019re often in one city for multiple days to play a pair of games and typically can\u2019t leave their hotels for anything other than basketball. Utah has the best record at the All-Star break, which obviously suggests the Jazz are a title contender. Recent history says otherwise. In the previous 11 seasons, nine teams that had the best record at the break didn\u2019t win the championship. The only exceptions: Miami in 2012 (the Heat were tied with NBA Finals runner-up Oklahoma City that season at 27-7 during the break), and Golden State in both 2015 and 2017. Even with shortened schedules \u2014 teams playing 72 games instead of the usual 82 \u2014 there is a chance the record for 3-pointers made league-wide in a season gets broken. NBA teams are on pace to make 27,731 3-pointers this season. That would be just 224 shy of the record, which is 27,955, set in 2018-19. Teams are averaging 12.8 made 3\u2019s per game, so the league is on pace to break that record for the ninth consecutive season. They\u2019re also averaging 34.9 attempts from 3-point range per game, which will be a record for a 10th consecutive season \u2014 and nearly double the rate from a decade ago. Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal leads the NBA in scoring at 32.7 points per game, and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid is second at 30.2 per contest. The Eastern Conference having the leaders in this category is a new twist. No player from an East team has won a scoring title since Carmelo Anthony did for New York in 2012-13. And the last time the East had the league\u2019s two leading scorers for a full season was 2008-09 \u2014 when Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade won the title, and Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James was second. There are four teams with active streaks of at least five consecutive seasons with winning records after the All-Star break. Toronto has five, Portland seven and Houston eight. And they\u2019re all light years away from San Antonio. The Spurs have a winning post-All-Star record in 22 consecutive seasons \u2014 a streak so long that it predates the last time the league didn\u2019t have an All-Star Game. The Spurs went 22-12 after the break in 1997-98, there was no game because of the shortened season in 1998-99, and the San Antonio streak has kept going every year since. The Spurs are 449-192 in the last 22 post-All-Star stretches, a 70% winning clip. The first half was hectic. There were 533 games in the season\u2019s first 72 days (excluding Christmas Eve, always an off day for the NBA), for an average of 7.4 games per day. The second half could be busier. If every remaining game gets played \u2014 in fairness, that\u2019s a very big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 the league would have 547 games over 68 days in the second half, or an average of just over eight games per day. Phoenix hit the All-Star break with the league\u2019s second-best record at 24-11. It is a major turnaround. The Suns\u2019 records at the last five All-Star breaks were awful: 22-33 last season, preceded by a league-worst 11-48 in 2018-19, 18-41 (tied for worst in the league) in 2017-18, 18-39 (29th out of 30 teams) in 2016-17 and 14-40 (tied for third-worst) in 2015-16. The last time the Suns were over .500 at the break had been 2014-15, when they were 29-25. And the last time they were this good by the break was 2007-08, when they were 37-16 \u2014 with current Brooklyn assistant Mike D\u2019Antoni coaching, current Golden State coach Steve Kerr running the front office and current Nets head coach Steve Nash playing point guard. Another note on Phoenix: Chris Paul remains elite. He\u2019s 47 assists away from 10,000 in his career, a milestone only five other players \u2014 John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Mark Jackson and Magic Johnson \u2014 have reached. This is Paul\u2019s 16th season. The New Orleans\/Oklahoma City Hornets had a losing record in the games that he played over his first two seasons, a difficult time for that franchise following the relocation caused by Hurricane Katrina. His teams have done nothing but win big since. This will be the 14th consecutive season in which Paul\u2019s team has a winning record when he plays; the Suns are 23-11 with him in the lineup this season. All five of Paul\u2019s teams over those past 14 seasons \u2014 the Hornets, the Los Angeles Clippers, Houston, Oklahoma City and now Phoenix \u2014 have at least a .600 winning percentage in his regular-season appearances. Combined, his teams over those 14 years have won 66.4% of their games when he plays. It\u2019s not an easy season for any team, with the games coming very quickly, not a lot of practice time and rosters tending to be in flux because of virus-related matters. Perhaps that\u2019s why no team has some sort of super-gaudy record at the break. Utah\u2019s 27-9 mark after the first half is the league\u2019s \u201cworst best\u201d mark since Sacramento was 37-13 to lead the league going into the 2004 All-Star Game. Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler is one of the league\u2019s few players who thrive in the mid-range game. That includes the unguarded 15-footer. Butler might do something the league hasn\u2019t seen in 12 years. The last time someone averaged at least 20 points per game and got at least 35% of those points at the foul line was 2008-09 when Sacramento\u2019s Kevin Martin did it \u2014 averaging 24.6 points, getting 36.4% of them at the stripe. Butler is averaging 20.5 points this season, 35% of that from free throws. Last season, Butler came close, with 37.9% of his points from the foul line. But he averaged 19.9 points, only three points shy of averaging exactly 20.0."},{"id":509451,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-league-pass-games-to-watch-week-12","date":"2021-03-10","title":"NBA League Pass Games to Watch: Week 12","content":"Note: All records and stats through games played on March 4 \u2013 the final day before the All-Star break Washington (14-20) at Memphis (16-16)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass In their first meeting of the season on March 2, Ja Morant post 35 points and 10 assists \u2014 the first 30-10 game of his young career \u2014 to lead the Grizzlies to a 125-111 win against the Wizards. NBA scoring leader Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook each scored 23 apiece, but no one could contain Morant as he shot 11-18 from the field, 2-3 from 3-point range and 11-14 from the free throw line. Will the Wizards have an answer this time around, or can Beal bounce back from his second-lowest scoring game of the season? The Wizards are just 2-8 this sedans when Beal scorers fewer than 30 points. Phoenix (24-11) at Portland (21-14)  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After spending Sunday as teammates for the victorious Team LeBron, All-Stars Chris Paul and Damian Lillard resume their roles as rivals in the Western Conference. The Suns entered the All-Star break as one of the hottest teams in the league, winning four straight and 13 of their last 15 games to climb to second place in the West. The Blazers currently sit in fifth place and have won three in a row, with Lillard taking over in the closing minutes in each of the last two wins. The Blazers are 9-4 in games decided by five points or less this season; the Suns are just 4-8 in such games. Philadelphia (24-12) at Washington (14-20)  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After missing the All-Star Game due to health and safety protocols, Joel Embiid should be available to return to the Sixers lineup on Friday when they take on the Wizards in Washington. This will be a matchup of the top two scorers in the league at the All-Star break: Bradley Beal at 32.9 ppg and Embiid at 30.2 ppg. The Sixers lead the season series 2-0 with Embiid averaging 33.5 points and 11 rebounds per game; meanwhile Beal posted a career-best 60 points in his last game against Philadelphia, but it was not enough to get the Wizards the victory. Toronto (17-19) at Charlotte (17-18)  7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After the top three teams in the Eastern Conference, there are nine teams separated by just three games in the loss column that span from fourth to 12th place. The Hornets and Raptors sit right in the middle of this group at seventh and eighth place, respectively, coming out of the All-Star break. With so many teams vying for playoff berths and possible spots in the Play-In Tournament, every game between these teams takes on added significance. The Raptors hold a 2-0 edge over Charlotte this season, with both games decided by just three points apiece. The Raptors have six players averaging at least 12 points per game against Charlotte, led by Chris Boucher\u2019s 22.5 points on 68.4% shooting. In the five games leading into the All-Star break, rookie LaMelo Ball has played some of the best ball of his young career, averaging 23 points, 7.8 assists and 5.6 rebounds while shooting 54.3% from the field and 55.2% (16-29) on 3-pointers. Cleveland (14-22) at Atlanta (16-20)  7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Both the Hawks (11th) and Cavaliers (13th) currently sit outside the Eastern Conference Play-In Tournament field, but both are well within striking distance as the second half of 2020-21 begins. While the Hawks have the edge in the standings, the Cavs have the advantage in the season series, winning the first two meetings with the Hawks by a total of just six points. This game features two of the top young guards in the game today in Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young (26.4 ppg, 11th in NBA) and Cleveland\u2019s Collin Sexton (24.1 ppg, 20th in NBA). In the first two meetings, Sexton got the better of the matchup, averaging 28 points on 55.9% shooting from the field and 50% shooting from 3-point range, compared to Young\u2019s 22 ppg on 34.9% shooting from the field and 25% from 3-point range."},{"id":509442,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-nba-tv-wednesday-march-10-2021","date":"2021-03-10","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: NBA TV Wednesday, March 10, 2021","content":"8:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 The Mavericks headed into the All-Star break having won three straight and nine of their last 11 games.

Leonard apologized for using the term, insisting he did not know what it meant when he used it Monday. The Heat learned of the matter Tuesday, and Leonard\u2019s future with the team is now in serious doubt.  \u201cThe Miami Heat vehemently condemns the use of any form of hate speech,\u201d the team statement said. \u201cThe words used by Meyers Leonard were wrong and we will not tolerate hateful language from anyone associated with our franchise.

Leonard acknowledged that he used the term Monday while streaming. In his apology, posted on social media, he said \u201cmy ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong.\u201d Leonard also said he was apologizing to team managing general partner Micky Arison and his family, the team\u2019s players, coaches and front office, his family and the Jewish community, among others. \u201cI acknowledge and own my mistake and there\u2019s no running from something like this that is so hurtful to someone else,\u201d Leonard wrote.  The video began circulating widely on social media Tuesday afternoon and the fallout was almost immediate, first with online criticism and then sharp rebukes by the league, the Heat and even other organizations. \u201cUnacceptable. Totally unacceptable,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said. Brooks added that he believes the NBA \u201cwill do the right thing and address it.\u201d That seems quite possible.

The four players involved were later cleared and did a workout after practice, Brooks said, adding that he hopes to be cleared in time to coach Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWithout getting into all the details, yeah, we hope so.\u201d"},{"id":509306,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/50-40-90-whos-in-reach-of-the-milestone-shooting-club","date":"2021-03-09","title":"50-40-90: Who's in reach of the milestone shooting club?","content":"Zach Lavine gulped down a swig of blue Gatorade and pondered the difficulty of joining the elusive 50-40-90 shooter\u2019s club. A first time NBA All-Star, LaVine sits on the cusp of reaching the milestone, connecting on 52.3% from the field, 43.5% from 3-point range and 85.7% at the charity stripe. \u201cI think it should always be something you shoot for because that means you\u2019re taking a lot [of shots] and making a lot,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cSo, obviously, I\u2019ve been shooting the ball really well. I think the hardest part about it is the free throws. I\u2019ve been really close a couple of times. You miss a couple of free throws and you\u2019re pretty much screwed.\u201d Free throws? Really? \u201cTrust me, I wish it was as easy as just walking up,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cThey are free. But man, if you miss a couple of them, [free-throw shooting percentage] goes from 89[%] to like 87 and trying to make up those points is almost terrible.\u201d Yet tremendous best describes the focus needed to shoot at least 50% from the field, 40% from deep and 90% at the free-throw line over the course of an entire season, given the milestone has been reached on just 12 occasions by eight players (Larry Bird, Steve Nash, Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Malcolm Brogdon) in NBA history. Elena Delle Donne increased 50-40-90 club membership to nine in 2019 with the WNBA\u2019s Washington Mystics. For the current shortened 2020-21 season, players longing to join the club need to hit the 50-40-90 threshold over the course of at least 51 games played, while knocking down at least 264 field goals, 110 free throws and 72 buckets from long range. Here\u2019s a look at the necessary qualifiers . In gauging the players with legitimate shots of joining the club, we look at the shooters achieving the mark of 47-37-87 over the first half of the season: The picture of consistency, Middleton entered the All-Star break having scored 20-plus in three of his previous four games, but he was shooting just 47.8% in those outings. The two-time All-Star missed out on the festivities this season, despite averaging a career-high 5.7 assists to go along with 20.6 points and 6.1 rebounds. One of the favorites to win the Kia NBA MVP, Jokic is on the way to establishing career highs in scoring (27.1 points per game), rebounding (11.0), assists (8.6) and steals (1.6), and his current shooting percentage is the best in his career. What\u2019s more is he\u2019s played in every Nuggets game this season. The engine that keeps the Suns shining, Paul moved past Magic Johnson as the All-Star Game all-time assists leader. But Paul is so consumed with sending Phoenix to its first playoff berth in 11 seasons that he\u2019ll view his numbers over the second half of the season as inconsequential. Good to see George and Damian Lillard work out their differences over the All-Star break. Now as the second half commences, pay close attention to the net rating (plus-17.5) George and Kawhi Leonard achieved as a duo over the Clippers\u2019 first 38 games. Short in all three metrics, Ingram could end up taking more attempts in all three categories as he looks to spark a Pelicans squad that lost four out of five going into All-Star break. Over that span, Ingram connected on 6 of 16 from deep. Led the Nets to a 10-1 record going into the All-Star break. His 27.2-point scoring average and shooting percentage are career highs, while his current hit rate from deep is just shy of his career-best mark of 41.5%. This defensive stopper consistently puts up numbers performing double-duty as the Clippers\u2019 go-to option. Leonard\u2019s 25.9% usage rate is the lowest it has been since his 2015-16 season in San Antonio. Scorched the field to win the 2021 MTN DEW Three-Point Contest, becoming the seventh player to capture multiple Three-Point Contests. Curry finished the first half of the season with the second-highest scoring output of his career, second to his 2015-16 MVP season. Averaging career-highs in FG% and FT%, and his shooting percentage from deep is his best since the 2018-19 season. Missed a pair of recent games due to a knee injury, but the break should do him good for the second half of the season. Became a full-time Raptors starter on Jan. 22, and he\u2019s putting up career numbers from 3-point range and at the free-throw line. Powell has also been Toronto\u2019s leading scorer (23.1 points) since becoming a full-time starter, and he could be in line for a nice payday should he decide to opt out of his deal. Kevin Durant could hit the magical 50-40-90 mark for the just the second time in his career, as he\u2019s hitting 49.3% from the floor, 38.2% from deep and 88.2% at the line. But the question is whether he\u2019ll play enough games to qualify. Durant played in just 19 games during the first half of the season, and the Nets\u2019 schedule consists of just 35 more outings, which means he could afford to miss just three games over the second half before falling out of the league\u2019s minimum requirements. Players such as Joel Embiid, Nikola Vucevic, Gordon Hayward, John Collins and Kyle Lowry appear to have a fighting chance at achieving 50-40-90, but currently sit just outside our barometer of 47-37-87. Karl-Anthony Towns, Joe Ingles, Miles Bridges and Jeremy Lamb are also putting together strong shooting seasons, but none are currently on pace to qualify for entry into the elusive 50-40-90 shooting club. * * * Michael C.

So we chatted up Utah center Rudy Gobert, whose best work comes in all those other games in which defense is not at all optional. A two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year and a top candidate (as indicated by this Ladder) to again win the award for 2020-21, Gobert is known as \u201cThe Stifle Tower,\u201d with the wingspan and timing to thwart opponents\u2019 shots or alter them with the threat of his presence. Gobert, averaging 14.2 ppg and 13.1 rpg, is the hub of the Jazz defense that ranks atop the league in net rating (8.5) and among the leaders in opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage (44.9), opponents\u2019 assists (22.1), defensive rebound percentage (75.4) and a few other metrics. But the eighth-year 7-footer knows he is not going it alone, as active as he is on that end of the floor. \u201cYou cannot defend by yourself. Basketball is a team game, and for me, many times I can make my team better defensively,\u201d Gobert said Sunday morning, before participating in his second All-Star Game. \u201cBut [it takes] communication, trying to make sure I\u2019m not just pushing myself, but pushing my teammates to be better defensively. When I\u2019m on the court and when I\u2019m on the bench.\u201d Among the league\u2019s more notable individual defenders and top-rated defensive teams, there\u2019s usually more than just one guy. Philadelphia has two DPOY candidates in guard Ben Simmons and center Joel Embiid. The Lakers have LeBron James as an effective, somewhat under-the-radar defender at age 36 and \u2014 most of the time \u2014 versatile big Anthony Davis. Last season\u2019s DPOY winner, Giannis Antetokounmpo, stirred Milwaukee\u2019s defensive drink \u2014 all while center Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe earned All-Defensive second team nods, giving the Bucks three of the 10 overall spots. \u201cWhen we look at individual awards and stuff,\u201d Gobert said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how good you are, if you don\u2019t make your team better in a team game like basketball, maybe you\u2019re not impacting enough.\u201d Utah\u2019s defensive focus begins with coach Quin Snyder and flows through Gobert. But the other Jazz players are diligent about that half of the game, too. Backup big Derrick Favors is a force in the middle defensively. Reserves Georges Niang (12.9) and Joe Ingles (10.5) have net ratings right behind Gobert (13.5). Certainly, there are ripple effects from being on the floor with Gobert. But that can work both ways, especially when it comes to the first line of defense on the perimeter. Mike Conley on point guards and Royce O\u2019Neale regularly matched up on the opponents\u2019 most potent scorer enable Gobert to be so effective as a safety net and help defender. \u201cMike is very quick,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cSmart. He\u2019s got quick hands. He\u2019s tough. Defense starts with toughness. You\u2019ve got to want to do it, do the dirty work. \u201cRoyce has been amazing the last few years, taking the challenge every single night to guard the best perimeter player. Royce is a very physical player \u2026 he\u2019s always up for the challenge.\u201d Conley\u2019s net rating (14.4) is Utah\u2019s best. Defensive field-goal percentage for shots under five feet, in which he ranks third (56.0), has him in a land of giants behind leaders Myles Turner and Jae Crowder, and just ahead of Brook and Robin Lopez. The veteran guard who made his All-Star debut Sunday is credited with .160 defensive win shares, just ahead of Gobert\u2019s .150. O\u2019Neale, while logging long minutes on scorers such as Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Antetokounmpo, is holding foes into 4.4% worse shooting from 15 feet out. He\u2019s good for 1.7 deflections nightly. Bottom line, excelling at defense as a team requires plenty of help, beyond DPOY types who hold rungs on this Ladder. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be part of a team where guys embrace that defensive mindset and take the challenge every single night,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cBecause we know in this league, someone is coming every single night to try to go off. It\u2019s great to break that mindset.\u201d (All stats through Monday, March 8) Last week\u2019s ranking : 1 Data is limited this week due to the season\u2019s first half ending on Thursday. Simmons and his big buddy, Embiid, didn\u2019t even get to feign playing defense in the All-Star Game, because of coronavirus concerns after their contact with their personal barber in Philadelphia forced them out of the event . Simmons continues to draw support here for his 1-through-4 defensive versatility and for the \u201chustle\u201d stats of deflections (3.9) and loose balls recovered (1.4) . Last week\u2019s ranking : 2 Defensively dominant big men are sort of the Mt. Everests of the NBA: people want to scale them simply because they\u2019re there. The challenge of trying to beat Gobert at the rim has energized a few guys, eventually demoralizing a bunch. The Jazz center leads the league in shots defended (18.9) and is flat-out rejecting 2.7 of them, while causing those opponents across all games and situations to shoot 7.0% worse than they normally would. Last week\u2019s ranking : 3 By the metrics cited in Gobert\u2019s synopsis, Turner is right there at 17.8 shots defended per game and a 6.7% improvement over what those opponents normally would shoot. Turner leads the NBA with 3.4 bpg. Then there\u2019s this: among defenders who have faced at least 600 shots of fewer-than-5-feet \u2014 a rough estimate for rim protection \u2014 foes are scoring 55.7% of the time. That\u2019s the lowest percentage for any individual defender in the category, right ahead of Gobert\u2019s 57.3%. (It\u2019s worth noting here that Antetokounmpo, who had the recent highlight block of Clipper center Ivica Zubac\u2019s two-handed dunk attempt, is tied for fourth now at 58.3%.) Last week\u2019s ranking : N\/A The Sixers\u2019 center has taken aim on winning both the Kia MVP and Kia DPOY awards this season \u2014 the way Antetokounmpo did last year \u2014 and halfway through, there\u2019s no reason he cannot win both. Here is one measure of his defensive impact this season: Among players who are credited with having faced at least 100 shots of all distances (less than 5 ft., 5-9 ft., 10-14 ft., 15-19 ft., 20-24 ft., and 25-29 ft.), Embiid has opponents shooting less than 40% at every distance from 5 feet and farther.

Before we start on that journey, let\u2019s take a look back at 10 standout moments of NBA All-Star 2021 in Atlanta. Originally instituted at the 2020 All-Star Game, the contest\u2019s new format failed to deliver the ultra-competitive fourth quarter we saw last season in Chicago. But Damian Lillard gave us a little something to remember by sending Team Durant home with a half-court jumper to close out the game. Dame\u2019s walk-off bucket gave Team LeBron a 170-150 win. What\u2019s more is Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry waved bye-bye in Lillard fashion, before the Blazers guard even reached half court. Both Lillard and Curry provided plenty of evidence throughout the night of their lethal range that we\u2019re sure to see again once the second half of the regular season commences. Welcome back. After Curry won his second 3-point contest with 28 points in a final round in which he edged Utah Jazz guard Mike Conley, we caught a display of more joy in the first half of the actual All-Star Game. Curry knocked down six 3-pointers in the first half, including one where he turned around toward the bench before it splashed, and another in the first quarter from the \u201cT\u201d in the midcourt All-Star Game logo. Curry also caught an alley-oop for a two-handed dunk. To see up close the joy that Curry plays with was refreshing after the three-time NBA champion sat out for the better part of a year rehabbing from injury. It was also nice to see Curry dedicate his 2021 MTN Dew 3-point Contest trophy to teammate Klay Thompson, the 2016 3-point contest winner, who is out for the year with a torn right Achilles. Remember, Curry and Thompson were the first pair of teammates to win consecutive 3-point contests. The All-Star Game generated in the neighborhood of $3 million for Historically Black College and Universities, through donations of scholarship funds. The league also made sure that HBCUs were well represented throughout the night. From utilizing officials that are HBCU alums, to the bands from Grambling State University and Florida A&M University playing during the player introductions, as well as the court design \u2014 which represented the academic significance and the spirit of HBCUs \u2014 the world caught a beautiful glimpse of the HBCU experience. And who could forget the Clark Atlanta University\u2019s Philharmonic Society Choir\u2019s stirring rendition of \u2018Lift Every Voice and Sing\u2019? It\u2019s just a suggestion, but perhaps the NBA should include the bands from HBCUs for player introductions and make them a part of the halftime show, too, for future All-Star games. Admit it, you smiled and probably chuckled a little when Team LeBron and Team Durant tipped off the second quarter with guards Chris Paul and Mike Conley at center court for the jump ball. They had no idea of what they were doing, and that\u2019s what made it so fun to watch. For the second year in a row, big men ran the show at the Taco Bells Skills Challenge , as Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis walked away with the trophy from a field that included Julius Randle, Luka Doncic, Nikola Vucevic, Robert Covington and Paul. TNT analyst Shaquille O\u2019Neal kept saying, \u201cbig men rule, big men rule,\u201d and he wasn\u2019t lying. Sabonis took out Doncic in the semifinals, while Vucevic knocked out Paul. Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo won the Taco Bells Skills Challenge last year in Chicago. Thank you, NBA, for such a nice gesture to honor our good friend Sekou Smith, a Jackson State University alum, who represented the very best of all of us. Smith was the face of NBA.com, and surely, he was smiling down big at his adopted home of Atlanta. We miss you tremendously, boss. If you\u2019re interested in donating to the Sekou Smith Journalism Award at JSU, please don\u2019t hesitate. The people responsible for all the music throughout the TNT broadcast of the All-Star Game should be applauded, because they certainly showcased all of the talent coming out of the city of Atlanta over the years. It was also great to hear from so many people representing the city during the broadcast; people such as Ludacris, Quavo, Killer Mike, 2 Chainz, mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, and Renee Montgomery, new part-owner of the Atlanta Dream, as well as many others. Seven-time Grammy Award winner Gladys Knight, a graduate of Shaw University, belted out a soulful performance of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d to start off the All-Star Game. The performance certainly capped off a great week for Knight. Four days prior, \u201cComing 2 America\u201d, the sequel to the 1988 classic \u201cComing to America,\u201d dropped on Amazon Prime. The 76 year old makes a cameo appearance during the sequel, in which she sings a beautiful, yet hilarious parody of her hit song \u201cMidnight Train to Georgia\u201d. She\u2019s definitely still got the singing pipes. For four years now, James has been a captain for the NBA All-Star Game, and his teams are a perfect 4-0 against teams captained by Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Curry. The victory helped Team LeBron donate more than $1 million to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, while Team Durant earned the United Negro College Fund $500,000. \u201cI hope that they allow me to retire from being an All-Star captain, so I can retire with a perfect 5-0 record,\u201d James said. \u201cI always try to pick the right team, and I\u2019ve been lucky enough for four years to pick the right team. Guys go out and compete and play to win. I\u2019ve been on the winning side of all four.\u201d Antetokounmpo captured his first Kobe Bryant NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award by scorching the nets for a perfect 16-of-16 shooting night. Antetokounmpo lucked out by knocking down on a few shots off the glass, but the bank always stays open for the Bucks\u2019 star, apparently. \u201cYou know, usually it is closed [on Sunday], but for me, it was open extended hours,\u201d Antetokounmpo joked. Before Antetokounmpo\u2019s scorching night, the most field goal attempts without a miss by a player in an NBA All-Star Game was in 1968, when Hal Greer connected on 8 of 8. Antetokounmpo\u2019s numbers register as an NBA All-Star record for the highest field goal percentage in an All-Star Game with a minimum of 15 attempts. * * * Michael C.

First, as we emerge from the break, the season is not yet halfway done, with 533 games played and 547 still to come. Second, the trade deadline is still 2 1\/2 weeks away. So there\u2019s time for teams to gather more data about where they stand and what their roster lacks before having to say yes or no to a deal. Some players could return from long absences this week and others may look recharged after a week off. The question is just how wide open the title chase is. The Los Angeles Lakers were the heavy favorite when they seemingly upgraded their championship roster, and they began the season 21-6, holding the No. 1 spot in these here rankings for seven of the first eight weeks. Maybe the Lakers\u2019 3-7 record since then is just about health and the grind of a tightly compressed season, and maybe they\u2019re not as obvious a pick to win the title as we thought two months ago when the Brooklyn Nets didn\u2019t yet have James Harden. Maybe the list of title contenders goes beyond the Lakers, Nets and Utah Jazz, who have torn through the league over the last two months. Keep your eyes on the Denver Nuggets, seemingly playing their best basketball after a slow start. With a thrashing of the Milwaukee Bucks last week, Denver is back in the top five, while the Nets have taken the No. 1 spot from the Jazz.

In the 2020-21 season, Griffin has seen action in 20 games with the Pistons, averaging 12.3 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 31.3 minutes per game. A six-time NBA All-Star (2011-15, 2019), Griffin has spent the bulk of his NBA career with the Clippers, averaging 21.6 points, 9.3 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.0 steals in 35.1 minutes per game in 504 games with the franchise. Griffin is also a five-time All-NBA selection, taking home second-team honors three times as a Clipper (2012-14) and third-team honors twice with the Clippers (2015) and Pistons (2019). Since making his debut in the 2010-11 season, Griffin ranks ninth in the league in field goals made (5,130), 10th in points (13,724) and 15th in rebounds (5,605). Griffin has also made seven playoff appearances in his career, including six straight seasons (2011-17) with the Clippers, helping lead the franchise to three Western Conference Semifinals appearances (2012, 2014-15). In 53 career playoff games, Griffin has averaged 21.2 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.1 steals in 35.3 minutes per contest. The Oklahoma City native was selected with the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Clippers and sat out the 2009-10 season due to a knee injury. He made his regular season debut the following season and secured Rookie of the Year honors after posting averages of 22.5 points, 12.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 37.9 minutes per game.

Giannis was surprised by this, based on his \u201cOh-my-goodness\u201d expression of joy and disbelief. That shot proved symbolic in multiple ways. One: The NBA All-Star Weekend , compacted to fit into one day instead of the usual three and hastily placed here at State Farm Arena, was helped by some good fortune. Two: That shot, one of 16 attempted and made by Giannis, helped him go perfect from the floor and capture the Kia NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award. There was some concern whether the NBA could pull this off during a pandemic without issues, and also if the league should\u2019ve even bothered. And the event started cryptically when Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid were scratched from playing because both Sixers ran afoul of contact tracing in Philadelphia by a barber who later tested positive for coronavirus. Simmons and Embiid were red-flagged before they arrived and came in contact with any of their fellow All-Stars, which of course would\u2019ve been problematic, somewhat embarrassing and forced a last-minute plug-pulling of the game itself. And yet, Sunday started and finished without any further flare-ups. Team LeBron, captained by LeBron James, claimed a 170-150 win over Team Durant, captained by the absent Kevin Durant. Team LeBron winning every quarter and the game itself earned $1.25 million for the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, with $500,000 going to the UNCF. Everyone left Atlanta \u2026 but not before exhaling. It didn\u2019t look like a typical All-Star event and certainly didn\u2019t feel that way, either. The scale of the mid-season gala was shrunken to fit the times, all in the name of safety. There were no league-sponsored parties, or corporate events with player appearances, or gaudy halftime performances by musical groups. \u201cThe prior (All-Star) experiences were more exhausting,\u201d said Stephen Curry, noting that players have heavy schedules because of sponsorships. \u201cHaving everything in one night was kind of cool.\u201d Imagine: A few weeks ago, some players were against the game, and afterward, players such as Curry and Paul George and a few others actually enjoyed the one-day version, which was far less taxing. This was an All-Star Weekend on a diet, done with business obligations in mind between the league and Turner, along with an opportunity to shine some light on (and extend some funds to) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and to keep the \u201cNBA brand\u201d vibrant. It\u2019s probably impossible to quantify what the league gained by refusing to cancel the weekend, but just the same, the league really didn\u2019t lose anything in the process, so in that sense, the weekend didn\u2019t come at a steep cost. Jaylen Brown of the Celtics, born and raised about 20 minutes away from State Farm Arena, on all the pregame concerns from fellow players and whether those fears were warranted: \u201cTo be honest, I felt nothing. Just playing a game that I love to play. You just get out there and you just have fun. You\u2019re on the floor with some of the best players to ever play. It\u2019s fun for me. I like that.\u201d As for the game: Team LeBron was stacked with shooters and Giannis and predictably eased to victory. LeBron was a captain for the fourth time, and for the fourth time his team won, despite LeBron benching himself late in the second quarter for good. Curry and Damian Lillard, normally rivals, were teammates and put on a show that only they are capable of doing. They each took turns dropping shots from the mid-court logo, and took delight in doing so, with Curry sinking a half-courter that beat the halftime buzzer and Lillard finishing off the game with a 40-footer and a wrist tap. They combined for 60 points and 16-for-32 from deep. These two guards dropped more bombs Sunday than Prince Harry and Meghan. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t draw it up any more perfect,\u201d Curry said about the back-and-forth with Lillard. Curry also had fun mocking LeBron\u2019s iconic moment from earlier this season; LeBron took a shot from the corner and before the ball fell through, turned and looked at his Lakers teammates. That received lots of internet and TV replay \u2026 although it was actually Curry who originated that shot years before. So Curry executed a corner no-look shot Sunday and earned a hand-slap of approval from LeBron. It was a fun day for Curry, who earlier won the 3-point contest by sinking the last ball to edge Mike Conley. He served notice as the best shooter in the game, if not all time, as if anyone wasn\u2019t convinced before Sunday. Ordinarily, given their twin performances, Curry and Dame would be required to arm-wrestle for the MVP award \u2014 or at least shoot it out in a side contest after the game \u2014 but when someone else doesn\u2019t miss in 16 attempts, that\u2019s tough to top. Giannis, their teammate, was perfect, and in the process set an All-Star Game record for players who attempted at least 10 shots. True, a handful were courtesy of lax defense, but Giannis did also make all three of his 3-pointers, which in itself is impressive for someone who often struggles from that distance. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d said Giannis. \u201cI wanted to win the one last year really bad and I had a chance to win because I felt like I wanted to have the trophy in my house, but this year I wasn\u2019t even thinking about winning it, I was just thinking about having fun, and I had the opportunity to play well.\u201d About those 3-pointers, he added: \u201cHey, man, I\u2019m trying to do this back home, too, but they\u2019re not letting me. So, you guys got to put the word in and tell them to let me shoot more 3s. No, I\u2019m joking. \u201cI was just having fun. Sometimes when you\u2019re not having fun you\u2019re not thinking about the outcome, it just happens. I just let my instinct take over. Obviously, I\u2019ve been working on it a lot over the summer, but I haven\u2019t used it as much in the season, but it\u2019s something I feel like I can do it. Today was like a game that did not count, so okay, I\u2019ll try it. It worked out.\u201d In other words, Curry and Dame didn\u2019t have a strong case for being robbed, not like Cassius Stanley in the dunk contest. Anfernee Simons of the Blazers claimed that contest with a final dunk where he attempted to kiss the rim. So maybe that\u2019s the symbol of the night, then: A kiss by Simons and a kiss off the glass by Giannis. The 2021 All-Star Weekend, which was actually an All-Star Day, was pulled off. Normally, that doesn\u2019t sound like a recap that\u2019s glowing or memorable or applaudable. In this case, an exception can be made. Given the forces against it and the challenges it faced, the All-Star event won just by surviving, and that required a heavy inhale and a bit of luck. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Simons captured the trophy by defeating Knicks rookie Obi Toppin in the finals of a competition that also included Cassius Stanley, the first player on a two-way contract to compete in the AT&T Slam Dunk. Simons rose high above the basket for his contest-winning dunk and appeared to be attempting to kiss the rim before stopping just short on the successful one-handed jam. The tallest competitor in the field at 6-foot-9, Toppin took the ball in between his legs from just beyond the free-throw line for a one-handed jam in the finals. The majority of the fireworks came in the early going of the AT&T Slam Dunk because each of the competitors completed successful jams in front of the panel of judges that included former dunk contest winners in Spud Webb, Dee Brown, Josh Smith, Jason Richardson and Dominique Wilkins. Having not yet netted a dunk in an NBA game, Stanley started off the opening round of the competition by throwing himself an alley-oop, before catching the ball, taking it through his legs, and completing the jam with his left hand. The judges gave Stanley a total score of 44. Next up, Toppin rocked the rim with a two-handed reverse tomahawk dunk. Toppin tossed himself a lob, caught the ball on the bounce and took it through his legs before the jam which resulted in a total score of 48 from the panel. Simons concluded the opening round with a score of 46 on his first dunk attempt. With the ball stationed atop the square on the backboard on a miniature Nerf basket, Simons jumped off both legs and yanked the ball off the mini hoop for a two-handed jam into the main basket. The attempt resulted in a total score of 46 from the five-man panel of judges. Considered by many to be the favorite due to his 44-inch vertical leap at the NBA Combine, Stanley was eliminated in the second round after missing his first attempt and finishing with a basic one-handed dunk that led to a score of 37. The second round of the competition produced the most stellar jams of the night from both Simons and Toppin. Toppin scored a 46 on his second-round dunk by stationing New York Knicks teammate Julius Randle under the basket along with his father, Obi Toppin Sr. Toppin missed his first attempt, but wowed everyone in attendance by clearing his father and teammate on the second try of a windmill jam with the ball cuffed in between his right hand and wrist. Toppin scored a 46 on that dunk. Simons topped that by paying homage to Hall of Famer Tracy McGrady. Simons put on a McGrady Toronto jersey and mimicked the former Raptor\u2019s jam from the 2000 All-Star Game. Simons tossed up a lob and completed a 360-degree two-handed jam. The judges gave Simons four 10s and a nine on that dunk for a total score of 49. \u2013Michael C.

We could stop right there if we had to,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cThe HBCU thing, that\u2019s awesome.

Washington is working the game for the third time, Brown for the second time and Kirkland also for the second time. Kirkland becomes the first ref to work back-to-back All-Star Games since Jack Madden in 1993 and 1994. Washington is a graduate of Norfolk State, Kirkland a graduate of Southern and Brown a graduate of Clark Atlanta. They fully understand the significance of this game and what the NBA shining the spotlight on HBCUs may wind up meaning for those institutions. \u201cI think that exposure from this game is going to be fantastic because we\u2019re going to actually enlighten people on another subset of our educational process here,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them exist on the same level as Ivy League schools, as Big Ten schools. And I also think that the fact that they\u2019re doing that and the fact that us three are going to be out there representing them should be empowering and encouraging to the young people behind us. There is quality education being provided by HBCUs.\u201d Even though this All-Star Game will differ from all others \u2014 the arena will be largely empty because of the pandemic \u2014 Brown said it\u2019s still an honor to be selected. \u201cThe most important part about this entire game, for us, is that we are representing the NBA officials and we have to do an outstanding job for them,\u201d Brown said. \u201cEvery night that we go on that floor we are representing each other.

No guarantees, mind you. But based on developments in dealing with COVID-19 in this country, as well as strides already taken by professional sports leagues \u2014 including the NBA\u2019s decision to stage its 70th All-Star Game Sunday in Atlanta \u2014 things appear to be trending up. \u201cMaybe for the first time in the past year,\u201d Silver said, in a virtual news conference, \u201cI\u2019m fairly optimistic that as we see fans returning to our arenas, as we see public health officials across the country begin to open up sporting events, theaters, restaurants, other forms of entertainment, I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to continue apace.\u201d That Silver was addressing media via a Web link, the way all NBA coverage has been transacted this season, with reporters socially distanced by hundreds of miles from him and each other was an obvious reminder of where league protocols are at the moment. But as the present gives way to the future, the rate at which restrictions are loosening and immunity is being achieved suggests an NBA that will resemble what we all knew prior to March 2020. \u201cBy the time we reach the playoffs in mid-May, things will even be considerably better than they are now,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAlso, obviously here in the United States, we\u2019ve been making excellent progress in terms of vaccinations. That will be very helpful in getting people back in the arenas.\u201d A playoff bubble similar to what we saw in Orlando last summer at the Disney World campus? Nothing like that planned this time. The Tokyo Olympics? Full rings ahead, both for Team USA and all the other national teams that lean on NBA players as their cornerstones. An undeniable source of Silver\u2019s optimism for what\u2019s coming is the success of this first half of 2020-21. Given all that might have gone wrong, the wellness of the personnel involved and the quality of competition has been remarkable. Many involved talk about the grind and isolation they\u2019ve endured in what the NBA terms \u201cwork quarantine,\u201d but the results are hard to deny. \u201cWe ended up playing 95% of our games,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe knew we were going to get positive cases for players and staff members operating out of the bubble. I felt our protocols held up as well as we could have hoped. \u201cI credit the schedule makers who had the foresight to divide the season in two parts. We were able to have the flexibility to push games into the second half of the season. Obviously, we won\u2019t have that same flexibility in the second half. Something we\u2019re watching for closely.\u201d The ongoing rollout of COVID vaccinations similarly will be tracked closely. The commissioner said the NBA will encourage its personnel to trust the vaccines, but will not mandate 100 percent compliance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that every player certainly needs to be vaccinated for fans to come back. I mean, that\u2019s not anything that the health authorities have suggested to us,\u201d Silver said. He added: \u201cNo more do I think the fact that every fan won\u2019t be vaccinated is an impediment of fans coming back to the arena. I think it\u2019s with a combination of vaccines, antibodies, herd immunity in communities, proper safety and cleanliness protocols, we\u2019ll be able to return to something that looks a lot closer to normal beginning next season.\u201d Silver did point out that getting vaccinated would open up what has been a pretty cloistered life so far for players and staff. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to do more in their communities,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sense is most will ultimately decide that it\u2019s in their interest to get vaccinated.\u201d The calendar could play the biggest role in resuming the Las Vegas Summer League or some variation of it this offseason. He said the league is considering an abbreviated version or mini-camps held by teams, among other options. As for the international games that have been a big part the NBA\u2019s basketball missionary work in past preseasons and regular season, well, that sounds like a 2022-23 thing for now. Silver discussed a number of other topics, including: \u2022 Recent concerns about opportunities for black head coaching candidates , triggered by Minnesota\u2019s quick employment of Chris Finch as Ryan Saunders\u2019 replacement, have fueled ongoing discussions at NBA headquarters. \u201cThere\u2019s no coach that I know who wants to get hired based on his skin color, but they want a fair opportunity,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cPart of that is ensuring that we\u2019re developing coaches appropriately in the pipeline, that they\u2019re getting the right opportunities to interview, the right opportunities to network as other coaches have historically done \u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt there\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d Silver did point to the demographics of teams\u2019 coaching staffs overall, including assistants and player-development aides. Minorities and even women are more broadly represented in those jobs than even a few years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create a process in which people are checking the boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires real engagement.\u201d \u2022 The announcement this week of the Overtime Elite League , in which high school-aged players (16 to 18) would get paid to play basketball and skip the traditional amateur routes revived talk about the NBA\u2019s approach to preps-to-pros talent. Silver noted the discussions he and National Basketball Players Association chief Michele Roberts have had and will continue to have in anticipation of the next collective bargaining agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s one where I think we\u2019re both on both sides of the issue sometimes in terms of what it will mean for the league having younger players,\u201d Silver said. The next CBA might dial back the NBA age requirement from 19 to 18, which enabled stars like Bryant, Garnett, LeBron James and others to skip college entirely. Silver noted that many of the NBA\u2019s international players turned pro as early as age 14. But it sounded as if the commissioner likes the mix available to US prospects, which includes a year or more of NCAA participation, a gap year in the G League prior to the NBA or maybe even the Overtime Elite idea. \u201cOptionality is good,\u201d Silver said, while adding: \u201cFor us right now, the NBA, we don\u2019t want to be in the business of paying minors.\u201d \u2022 Some quick ejections and regrettable mistakes, highlighted by eagerly awaited but impotent last-2-minute reports issued the day after, have put the quality of this half season\u2019s officiating in the spotlight. Silver said the data shows \u201cnothing aberrational happening, whether in terms of accuracy of calls or number of technicals on the floor.\u201d But on the life-is-tough-all-round page, he said, leave room for the refs. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned over the last year is that the mental stress [in the pandemic NBA] is incredibly tough on everyone involved,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIn some cases you have some younger officials, too, who maybe are still trying to calibrate their relationships with players.\u201d Another simple factor: Empty or near-empty arenas might have made some harsh comments directed at an official easier for them to hear. \u2022 Despite a burst of energy in recent weeks about alternative silhouettes for the NBA\u2019s official logo, including the late Kobe Bryant, Silver made it sound as if the league\u2019s avatar will continue as is for the foreseeable future: an outline of Lakers HOFer Jerry West in full dribble, though its identity never has been confirmed. Same with baseball (Harmon Killebrew), by the way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel to me that this is the appropriate moment to be changing the logo,\u201d Silver said. \u2022 Kevin Garnett, 2020 Hall of Fame inductee for his work mostly with the Timberwolves and Celtics, vented in an Instagram post this week about being snubbed in his desire to buy the Minnesota team from owner Glen Taylor. Taylor has flirted with selling the franchise for years, but invariably has maintained his majority position. Garnett and a group of investors were among several suitors in Taylor\u2019s most recent call for bids. But their fractured relationship took another turn south with the post. Said Silver: \u201cObviously, Kevin sounded frustrated. Glen said he never heard directly from him. Yes, that is an opportunity for me to get directly involved, and I will.\u201d \u2022 Silver said that the push for this year\u2019s All-Star Game should be judged once it\u2019s over, rather than anticipating possible problems. He explained the league\u2019s rationale, too, as something beyond a one-night programming nod to broadcast partner TNT. \u201cIt has more to do with the larger brand value of the NBA,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we went forward with All-Star, not only did roughly 100 million people vote for the All-Stars on a global basis, but based on past ratings, well over 100 million people will watch the game and the ancillary competitions. We\u2019ll have over a billion social media views and engagements. \u2026 It\u2019s sort of what we do. For me, it would have been a bigger deal not to have it.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

James Harden ( last two seasons ) is the only active player on that list. \u2022 That list of 32.9 points per game scorers gets even smaller when you add the 5.4 rebounds and 4.7 assists that Beal is averaging this season. Only four players have ever posted 32.9 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 4.7 apg over a full season: James Harden , Michael Jordan , Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor . \u2022 Leads the NBA with 22 30-point games this season, including six in a row from Jan. 6-27, 2021, which is the longest streak of any player this season. \u2022 Leads the NBA in both second- (8.1) and third- (10.3) quarter scoring.

If he maintains those averages for the rest of the season, he would be the first to average 30-11 since Karl Malone in 1989-90. \u2022 Ranks second in total raw plus\/minus as Utah has outscored its opponents by 277 points in Conley\u2019s 853 minutes on the court over 29 games. When using per game rather than totals, Conley leads the league with an average point differential of 9.6 points per game while on court. \u2022 Shooting a career-best 42.2% from 3-point range in his 14th NBA season; he will also participate in the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest on Sunday. \u2022 Ranks fifth in the league in defensive efficiency as the Jazz allow only 101.8 points per 100 possessions while Conley is on the court. \u2022 Of the 323 players that have defended at least 100 shots this season, Conley allows the fourth-lowest field goal percentage at 38.7%, which is 6.1 percentage points lower than his opponents normally shoot. \u2022 Of the 70 players that have defended at least 100 pick-and-roll ball handler plays, Conley allows the fifth-lowest points per possession (0.78), holding opponents to an effective field goal percentage of 39.1% (third-lowest). \u2022 Leads the NBA in assists at 11.1 per game; he is also last player to average at least 11 assists per game over a full season when he won his first assist title in 2016-17 (11.2 apg). \u2022 Leads the NBA in minutes played at 37.8 per game.

He has a long way to go to catch franchise leader Jason Kidd with 61. \u2022 There have been seven games this season in which a player reached at least 30 points and 15 assists , Harden has three of those seven games. \u2022 Averages a league-high 8.9 points per game on isolation plays in his 23 games with Brooklyn. This is 2.7 ppg better than he did in his eight games in Houston (which would still rank second among all players). \u2022 Leads the NBA in clutch scoring with 105 points. The Bulls have played the second-most clutch games in the NBA (22) and are 10-12 in those games. \u2022 Has the highest-scoring fourth quarter in the league this season with 24 points against Orlando on February 5. It is the third-highest scoring quarter of any period this season behind 25 from fellow All-Stars Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid. \u2022 The two-time Slam Dunk champion has only 31 dunks in 34 games so far this season (0.9 per game). Last season, he had 88 dunks in 60 games (1.5 per game). \u2022 Ranks fifth in 3-pointers made (120) and 18th in 3-point percentage (43.5%).

In the first section of a three-part interview, each official shares their take on why they chose their school, how their college experience shaped them personally, and what makes the HBCU experience unique. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Sean Corbin (Coppin State University): My initial goal was to be an attorney. Somehow, I got introduced to basketball, and I played in high school and college. The whole officiating thing took off when I realized that my basketball career wasn\u2019t going to go to the level that I thought it was. There are other happenings that people don\u2019t realize can still make you a part of the game. The only other way that I realized I could still participate on the court without being a player was to be a referee. Refereeing was a unique discipline that taught you good communication skills, how to control your nerves under pressure, learning to focus, and just seeing how good you could be as an individual. That sort of hit my heart, and I felt a passion and love with that particular discipline of the craft of refereeing, and it just took off from there. Eric Lewis (Bethune-Cookman University): [Basketball] gave me the opportunity to get a better education and play at a higher level than just high school. For most people in a city, that\u2019s what sports provide for us. Because even though you have two parents that work blue-collar jobs, they can\u2019t afford for their kids to go to college. So now, we rely on sports to help us get out of and better our lives. That\u2019s the role basketball played for me to get me to a better stage in life. I didn\u2019t think it would take me to become a referee and to enter the NBA \u2026 I was playing in summer leagues and on traveling teams. A referee that remembered me from college said I should try refereeing. I did it because I promised him I would try it. I just want to live up to my promise to him because the guy that was a referee coached my sisters from softball to volleyball to basketball coming up. He knew me and my family. I kept my word to him because he\u2019s been there for us. Once I picked the whistle up, I put the basketball down. Matt Myers (Hampton University): My dad was a referee at a high school growing up. So basketball has always been around, and sports have been around my life. I used basketball to help me financially through college. It was one of the things that I did on the side to keep some money in my pocket. I have a lot of friends through basketball. I\u2019ve made a lot of connections through basketball. Basketball has treated me very well, and I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to obviously referee in the NBA because of basketball. Courtney Kirkland (Southern University): Basketball has been a part of my life, my whole life. My dad was a basketball coach, so I was born into the game of basketball. He was a very famous basketball coach in Flint, Michigan. I used to always tease him because when I was born, he had just started at a new high school. And when you are dealing with a brand new school, it\u2019s hard to get players there, and usually, teams don\u2019t do very well when they\u2019re brand new. The year after I was born, my dad took a brand new team to the state finals. Over the years, I used to tease my dad and say I was the reason you were so successful with basketball was because I\u2019m the one who made your basketball career turn out the way it was. But I\u2019ve been in basketball my whole life. I actually started officiating, though, based upon a dare. I had a career-ending injury, so basketball was over for me as far as playing. I went to school, got my degree in computer science, and did internships. I thought maybe I\u2019d go into coaching. At that time, I was doing an internship back in Flint with General Motors, and I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues, and I said I want to stay involved in basketball. He told me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look into refereeing?\u201d I said, \u201cRefereeing? Oh, absolutely not. I don\u2019t even like referees \u2014 I definitely don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d And then he said, \u201cOh if you\u2019re scared to try something new, I understand you can just leave it alone.\u201d I was like, wait a minute. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m scared. From that conversation, I just started thinking about it. I\u2019m sitting here saying I don\u2019t like referees, but I don\u2019t know anything about it. I never knew what the profession really was or what the craft was. And so I took on the challenge. I\u2019ve fallen in love with the craft, and it\u2019s been a part of me for all of these years. I wouldn\u2019t look back and do anything different. Tom Washington (Norfolk State): I\u2019ve always loved the game. I never thought about officiating initially. It was always about trying to play, but I volunteered for a church group for kids. I decided to read the rulebook so I could teach the kids the right way to play, and that really opened my eyes. I realized that I didn\u2019t know many of the rules. I knew how to play, but I don\u2019t know what the actual rule is. And so, in trying to teach them, I taught myself. That became a whole other passion for me because it was a whole different side of basketball that I really didn\u2019t know much about. Tony Brown (Clark Atlanta University): I wanted to stay connected with something that I grew up with playing my entire life, and basically, through the direction of my mom, playing basketball really kept me out of trouble. It provided an outlet for that idle time I had to keep me focused on something that was basically the love for the game. My dream was, of course, to play in the league, and it didn\u2019t happen. I wanted to do the next best thing and stay connected and try to referee. I had some really good friends get me involved with it. We\u2019re still friends to this day: Glenn Tuitt, Chuck Jones, and Tony Green. They mentored me, got me involved, and helped me learn the craft. I\u2019m forever grateful to them for helping me make that transition because I was just trying to continue to play. CJ Washington (Southern University): Once I finished school, I was at the YMCA playing basketball, and a guy approached me about refereeing basketball, which I had never thought of. I never even gave an inkling [of thought to being a referee]. I said no. I had just graduated and was in the process of interviewing to get a job. I asked him if they would pay me. He said, \u201cYeah.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, sign me up.\u201d You know, I gotta pay rent and I need to pay my cell phone bill. I got involved in the high school chapter and fell in love with it. And it just kinda took off from there. I just had a little bit of a feel for the game. Derrick Collins (Xavier University): When I was able to re-activate that dream [of making it to the NBA] as a referee, it just took me to a whole other level of appreciating the sport that provided for me throughout my life. Now that I\u2019m on the other side, I\u2019m now actually in a place where I\u2019m providing for my family. I\u2019m able to travel the world, see people I normally would never have seen before, and it also brings life to my family members \u2014 mainly my mother and my father. They watched me over the years as a player through high school and college. And now, as they\u2019re in their 70s, it\u2019s now still bringing added life to them. They watch their son travel the world and referee these superstar athletes. When I get back to New Orleans, they come to the game. That really is a beautiful thing to see, just to look up into the stands and see my parents there. But when they\u2019re not at the games, they\u2019re at home, and they have League Pass to watch all of my games. This sport has basically shaped and molded me, but it\u2019s also brought life to my family. Bennie Adams (Southern University): I started officiating just to get gas money. I was a lifeguard by trade [in college], and it was going through a down economic cycle. I wasn\u2019t going to get the rest of my work-study money. I walked in on the intramural officiating meeting, trying not to deplete the rest of my funds. I refereed that night and have been doing it ever since. I never thought I\u2019d still be doing it. Marc Davis (Howard University): I grew up in Chicago where basketball is king. I think of the YMCA program that I participated in as a child, along with plenty of kids who became Division I athletes, professional players and coaches. Basketball was always there, and now allows me to provide for my family. We\u2019re all lifers here, and to be 53 years old and still be wearing a uniform, is pretty special. I\u2019ve been thinking lately about how my entire life, I\u2019ve always been wearing a uniform and have been a part of something bigger than myself. In the officiating community, we talk about a sense of humbleness, serving others and being a leader. Nobody has ever paid to see a referee officiate a game, but we do provide an environment where high-level athletes can compete and display their skill set in a manner that\u2019s entertaining to millions of fans around the world. Corbin: We all kid each other. We have a sense of pride. You want your university and your school to do well. When you are my age [54] and you also have a son or a sibling who also attends [an HBCU], it gets into a bragging rights thing, and it just makes for good humor. Lewis: [My school] is the best. I don\u2019t wanna hear nothing about nobody else\u2019s HBCU. Bethune-Cookman. We talk about our bands, our football teams. Most of us play sports, so we say my team would have whooped your team. It\u2019s this sense of pride when you see each other and a sense of family. You can\u2019t forget where we come from. When we walk, we walk together. Myers: It\u2019s an immediate sort of bond. I mean, we didn\u2019t all go to the same HBCU, but I think we lived a similar HBCU experience. There are bragging rights whenever we get together and talk about it. We all kind of think our HBCU is a little bit better than the other, but I think we all are very proud that we attended and are representing our HBCU as well as the NBA at the same time. Tom Washington: I think it\u2019s unique to be able to share our experiences with each other. Each school has its own unique experience of campus life, but there\u2019s actually a common thread that runs through all HBCU schools. We understand what you were doing at your school, and we like to talk about how we did similar things at ours. It\u2019s a unique bond that\u2019s great to share, not only amongst ourselves, but amongst our peers that we work with as well, to tell them how things were, how we were educated, and how we socialized at an HBCU. Karl Lane (Philander Smith College): Some of [the other NBA officials] I\u2019ve known before I even knew they went to an HBCU. I had already known them for years before I started officiating. We still have a brotherhood with everyone on staff, given the group of NBA officials is small. Brown: It was funny until a few years ago, we didn\u2019t know exactly who went where except for a few of us. One thing is the 11 that have attended, and nine graduated all know that Clark Atlanta University is still the best of all of them. I mean, that\u2019s a consensus. Even if you ask them, they\u2019ll tell you. They know Clark Atlanta University is by far, head and shoulders above all of them. But I think the one common bond that we all share is that we all continue to strive to be decent human beings. CJ Washington: Yeah, that\u2019s definitely a shared experience. We would get together, and crack a little joke here or there that you understand only if you went to HBCU. Common experience is what creates bonds, right? I have a bond with every referee on the staff, because we have a common experience of refereeing basketball together, and then you have other smaller bonds within that that are created through other different common experiences. It\u2019s always good to talk about the bands. I\u2019ll tell you this and don\u2019t you forget it. I don\u2019t care what anybody else tells you. The greatest band ever is Southern University. If you want to do your own research, just go to YouTube, and you can make your own decision. Davis: I do feel an extra special connection with other officials. Although I would agree with my other colleagues that our group is very tight. We do have that connection to this passion for the game of basketball and then this micro-passion for the profession of referee. But then there is that extra special twist of a shared experience prior to coming into this group. Once you come into this group, you become a referee and everybody\u2019s treated the same. And it\u2019s a very fraternal profession now with [seven] women in the mix, who get no quarter from anyone else, nor do they ask for any quarter. But then having that connection to a shared experience during your developmental years does kind of have an extra special touch to it. I don\u2019t think any perspective has ever been exclusive of anybody, I think has been inclusive. And I think that comes back from that sense of competence. Collins: When you work an All-Star Game, it kind of breaks the ice between the players, the coaches, the referees, and we get a chance to mingle with our families. My first couple of years, I always had confrontations with [a bruising All-Star]. I got a chance [at All-Star Weekend] to reintroduce myself to him along with my wife. It was at a social event, and it was one of the best experiences as I interacted with someone that I felt I would never be able to have a peaceful conversation with. It was something I\u2019ll never forget. It just carried with me everywhere. I know in the heat of the moment he has to do his job. I have to do my job. But overall, we\u2019re still men that are in a business where we have to wear our hats. It was a normal conversation, and he really thoroughly enjoyed meeting my wife. My first game out of the All-Star break [the bruising All-Star was playing]. I had a call, and he was upset. Did he not remember that we just had a conversation at All-Star?! Later on in that game, I\u2019m at the free-throw line with him, and now it\u2019s just him and I talking, and he said, \u201cMan, you know, I didn\u2019t mean anything about it. Tell your wife I say hello.\u201d It was just funny, so I\u2019ve never forgotten that. This was one of the toughest guys that prepared me with how to deal with anybody else. Now I exchange conversation within the heat of the moment. If I can deal with him, I can deal with anybody else. Tom Washington: One of my favorite moments was being alongside Danny Crawford and Tony Brothers officiating The Finals in 2012 at Oklahoma City. That was the first time three Black officials had been on the floor at the same time. So that was a proud moment for me. Corbin: I had a triple-overtime game in 1999. It was Vancouver vs. Boston. I had never worked a triple-overtime before. It felt like the game lasted almost a year because both teams were so competitive, and nobody wanted to leave or lose. You could see that there was mental fatigue, there was physical fatigue, but you had to find an inner strength within yourself to do whatever you had to do to get through the game and to get to the end. That was a phenomenal experience. Lewis: The most memorable [moment] is my first game as an actual NBA referee. It was Golden State at Dallas. And when you walk out on the floor, you go, is this real? You kind of want to kiss the floor and pinch yourself and make sure you\u2019re in the right spot. \u2026 It took two months until I really realized that I\u2019m an NBA referee. That very first game had a dramatic ending where Dallas is down three and Michael Finley hits a three-point shot in the corner right in front of me on a double team, and they go into overtime. It was like, wow, my first game in overtime. Myers: This is only my third year, but I really think my fondest memory is my dad, who started me refereeing when I was about 14 or 15 years old. He attended a game last year in Indianapolis, and he refereed for over 40 years. It was cool to have him and his college and high school basketball buddies and his best friends in the stands watching me referee an NBA game. Kirkland: Probably my very first playoff game because I was so, so nervous. Shaq was playing with Miami at the time, and they were playing against Chicago. There was so much intensity in the arena. The fans seemed to be louder than they were during the regular season, and there was just so much energy. I can just remember being so nervous and just saying to myself, don\u2019t mess up, don\u2019t mess up, don\u2019t mess up. That\u2019s just a lot of pressure I put on myself to be as perfect as I possibly can, but then there\u2019s the outside pressure to do things the way that the game is designed to be played. Brown: I think my fondest memories of officiating a game is when my family gets to come and watch me work because it\u2019s such a huge sacrifice for them while I\u2019m out here working. It\u2019s a great reward, but the sacrifice being away from them is taxing. Whenever they get an opportunity to come to watch me work, wherever it is, that makes it even more rewarding. CJ Washington: The day that I got hired. That\u2019s one of those days that just you don\u2019t forget: August 24, 2016. I was in Cheddar\u2019s ordering food, and I got the phone call. I\u2019m talking and all of a sudden I wasn\u2019t hungry. I was just so excited to have that moment finally come. Something that you had dreamed about and envisioned, and finally to be told we\u2019re inviting you on to the NBA staff. I would say that when I think about moments that one just always sits at the top. Adams: My fondest memory is [seeing] the number of officials that have come out of Southern University. It\u2019s been amazing to watch. Not just in the NBA, but also in the NCAA. Davis: In my second or third year, I worked a Finals game with two gentlemen I had known since I was a child \u2014 Danny Crawford and James Capers. I grew up in the same neighborhood as James Capers and good friends with his younger brother. And that\u2019s one of my greatest memories. To me, it\u2019s not about the game, per se, it\u2019s more about the relationships. When I was 29 years old, prior to being married or having children, I made friends with people who are in their 60s. They weren\u2019t my parents\u2019 friends, an uncle or a former teacher, they were my friends. As a young man, to have friends with that kind of experience by far is the most remarkable thing I\u2019ve experienced. Now, I have friends who are way closer to my children\u2019s age than they are to mine. The friendships are the most remarkable things I think about as opposed to the games. That game with Danny and James is more remarkable because of our families all being there and the kids growing up with each other. That\u2019s what makes it more memorable than the actual experience. And I think that\u2019s consistent with my experience with HBCUs is just the friendships that I\u2019ve had over the years."},{"id":507815,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-referees-blogtable-choosing-to-attend-an-hbcu","date":"2021-03-07","title":"NBA Referees Blogtable: Choosing to attend an HBCU","content":"This season, there are 11 NBA referees who attended one of the nation\u2019s 105 historically Black colleges and universities. In the first section of a three-part interview, each official shares their take on why they chose their school, how their college experience shaped them personally, and what makes the HBCU experience unique. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Courtney Kirkland (Southern University): I originally considered going to Marquette University in Milwaukee. That\u2019s a big difference versus being in Baton Rouge (La.), just even the weather itself. But the culture was a little bit different when I visited Southern. I remember watching Southern play football on TV. When I went to visit, the experience was something different. The culture, the food; it was just different. A different environment. A different vibe. And that was one of the reasons why I wanted to go down to Louisiana. I just fell in love with the culture there. Sean Corbin (Coppin State University): The reason why I chose the school is that my godfather attended, as well as my mother and my wife. We kind of had an extended family with my wife with a tradition of that we all want to attend a Historically Black College, and the choices that we had in the Baltimore area, which is where I grew up, were Morgan State University and Coppin State University. Eric Lewis (Bethune-Cookman University): Back then, it was called Bethune-Cookman College, and now it\u2019s Bethune-Cookman University. I\u2019m a homegrown kid right out of Daytona Beach (Fla.). My mom, my sisters and my brother went to Bethune-Cookman. So it\u2019s a tradition in a sense \u2013 really never leaving outside of my neighborhood or Daytona. It was comfortable. Matt Myers (Hampton University): [My father] suggested I attend a Historically Black College because he went to one many years ago; he went to Knoxville College in Knoxville, Tennessee. Karl Lane (Philander Smith College): I chose my school because my grandmother attended there and she wanted me to be there as well. She played on the basketball team back when women only played half court, so that\u2019s one of the main reasons I chose to attend. Tony Brown (Clark Atlanta University): I initially attended Florida A&M University to play basketball and ended up transferring to Clark Atlanta University where I graduated with a degree in finance. I had family members that had attended Florida A&M, so that was initially why I wanted to go there. It was just kind of falling in line with family tradition. One thing I did know is that selecting Florida A&M and then Clark Atlanta University, they just had a strong sense of community and pride and I wanted to be a part of that. Being a Black man, it was just empowering to know and see people that had like-minded thinking. It just gave me a sense of empowerment to want to go and get my education. It was really, really, really good. It was a very supportive environment and it was very good for me. It was a quality education, affordability was the key, and that was the main connection for me. CJ Washington (Southern University): I grew up going to Southern University football games, basketball games, homecomings and Bayou Classic. My mom attended Southern University. I had a lot of other family, older cousins, aunts, who attended Southern University. It was a family tradition. It was seamless. Before I even got into Southern, I had been on campus several times throughout my life. It was very natural for me to go to Southern. Derrick Collins (Xavier University of Louisiana): They wanted me to play on the basketball team. The coach came to my house, interviewed me and my parents. They awarded me an athletic scholarship. It was a telling sign for me and also because my parents went there. It\u2019s a family tradition. Bennie Adams (Southern University): I don\u2019t know why I chose [Southern University]. I started off my education at LSU. Out of high school, both my parents went to HBCUs, and encouraged me to go to HBCU \u2014 in particular, Southern. But me being 18, I didn\u2019t listen. I started at LSU and at the end of my third year, I wasn\u2019t happy. I was three semesters from graduating in electrical engineering and knew I wanted to do something different. I transferred schools and changed my major to math, which was my first love. They had a great math department. Southern became the ideal choice, and I never looked back. Marc Davis (Howard University): When I left the Naval Academy, I was looking to jump into school right away. My mother was a graduate of Fisk University in 1965, and one of her classmates there, Dr. Ron Walters, was the chairman of the political science department [at Howard University] \u2026 I was looking for a place to just be a student, and Dr. Walters was a connection, since I was previously a political science major at Navy. It was just an easy transition for me to go there. Corbin: Oh, wow. That\u2019s a pretty loaded question. You know, thinking back over the experience [at Coppin State University], I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything in the world. I met my wife there. My mother went there \u2026 The people I met from all walks of life and the experiences I had being in a small community, I think it\u2019s really beneficial. You\u2019re a young kid coming out of high school. You want to attend a university and get a new experience. I think having a family atmosphere makes you feel comfortable, and you\u2019re not a small fish in a big pond. I felt really, really comfortable attending. Lewis: It was phenomenal. I\u2019m pretty sure every college student says that \u2026 [Bethune-Cookman] University was very involved in the community. So we attended programs there as youths. In the summer, it was called the NYSP [National Youth Sports Program]. It was huge for kids in our community because every part of our community was represented. We played sports the entire summer in that program \u2026 watching all the football games, the homecomings, the basketball games \u2014 my sisters played basketball and softball there. Going to games and being the last child, I got to see all that, and I grew to become like a Wildcat. Myers: Going to an HBCU like Hampton was cool because a majority of the kids look like me, and a majority of the teachers looked like me. There was a lot of culture. They really wanted academics to be the focus of your college experience. I was fortunate enough also to play golf while I was there so that molded part of my college career being around athletics.  Kirkland: I look at it this way. I always say that I grew up in Flint, Michigan, but I became a man when I was in Baton Rouge. I was raised in Flint \u2013 I was taught the values to survive in this world as a young man. But when I went off to Louisiana, it started me becoming my own man. I had to learn valuable lessons to just survive as a man. Period. And that\u2019s why I say that I became a man there because I went away from my parents. My whole family was still in Michigan. I was so far away from them. I was doing things on my own. I was learning different things on how to survive on my own. There was schoolwork; there was basketball, then there was just life outside of that. I was just learning all of those things, and I didn\u2019t have mom and dad to lean on. I was having to get some of those experiences myself: some good, some bad. And I think those are the things that shaped me into the man that I\u2019ve become now. Tom Washington: I think one of the best parts about [attending Norfolk State] is that it was a more comfortable learning environment where I was able to excel. And it also helped me financially because I was able to obtain educational scholarships along the way. It was a wonderful experience there. It took a lot of hard work, but it was fun, too. Brown: [Clark Atlanta University] helped me develop into a responsible individual. Not only the educational piece, but it helped me gain life skills and teach me what it took for me to be a Black man surviving out in the world, and not just in America, but in the world. It gave me the foundation for who I am today. It taught me a lot about respect and treating people the way you want to be treated. It helped with what I was taught by my mom. That was some of her core values of raising me, my brother and my sister was you always treat people the way you want to be treated. Be respectful to people and it\u2019ll come back to you the way you give it. CJ Washington: Prior to marriage, [attending Southern University was the] best four years of my life. It was great. It was a moment in time where I was able to be independent, and gained some friends who are more like family now. To be on a campus where you\u2019re not the minority, it\u2019s just a very comfortable feeling. You just kind of figured out who you are and through those experiences, it helped me grow and taught me a lot about responsibility, accountability. [Learning to be] present with what it is you\u2019re doing and trying to do it at your best. Be the best that you can be in whatever you decide to do when you\u2019re on the campus. Collins: [Xavier University] developed me from an academic standpoint. It gave me an opportunity to be comfortable with a lot of the African-Americans that went there, but it was very diverse as well. It gave me an opportunity to really engage with my professors. The classes were small, populations for us at the school were small. As an athlete, it really gave me a direct connection with the faculty there. And it helped me in classes that I wasn\u2019t doing well in to have that one-on-one individual time where they would help me improve in my studies. I can get that one-on-one attention that maybe I wouldn\u2019t have gotten at a bigger university, but for me it just helped because they were able to know who I was. Adams: My time at Southern was probably one of the best times of my life \u2013 that period of finishing my undergraduate studies and completing my masters. It helped me find that happiness is more important than money or goals and success. I also learned that I could do anything that I put my mind to, so as far as dreaming something and actually being it \u2026 I was just around so many other people that had dreamt and done so many amazing things [across] so many different facets of life. It was any and all people of color, and it was totally enriching \u2026 Everybody had done amazing things that weren\u2019t noted because it\u2019s just not covered, especially back then, because there was no social media, no email. Davis: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lacking in terms of intellectual experience. Maybe the facilities are not as comparable, the endowments are clearly not. The physical experience may not be the same, but it\u2019s the emotional connections, which is what you really attach to your university \u2014 the relationships, the friendships and the experiences is what keeps you engaged as an alumni for life. That is a benefit. At Yale or Harvard, you\u2019ll be intellectually stimulated, but we\u2019re not at a point yet where you\u2019re not just a Black student. And we\u2019re at a place now where, as a Black student, you\u2019re not treated any differently. But you still have that weight of always being a minority or always trying to navigate how to fit in and make yourself, and others, comfortable. It\u2019s a heavy weight. At an HBCU, you can just be a student. For African American students, that\u2019s just a phenomenal weight off of you, and generally allows you to spread your wings a little more by engaging more intellectually and socially. Then, that prepares you for wherever you go next, you go with a sense of empowerment and sense of understanding of what your rightful place is, a sense of confidence and sense of self. Corbin: The uniqueness is that you\u2019re around people that are pretty much like yourself. You\u2019ve come from similar backgrounds. You have some of those similar beliefs. It gives you a comfort level. It gave you a sense of pride \u2026 Historically Black colleges gave you an opportunity to attend if you couldn\u2019t afford it or have the funds. They would offer grants like other universities, but HBCUs just gave you the family atmosphere. It gave me a comfort level and built my confidence up as a growing young man. Lewis: My mother, all she thought about was we just got to get you out of high school. Graduate high school. Now, to have the ability to go to college because it was seven of us and a single parent. Just getting through high school was the epitome. It signified something. I\u2019m [able to go to college] on a basketball scholarship. My oldest sisters didn\u2019t go to college. But now, they\u2019re going to college, and they understand the significance of having a degree. The youngest siblings \u2014 me and my other two sisters \u2014 we were able to go to college on scholarships. That was huge for us. An experience to go there, to see people like you getting a higher education and survive or have a better life than what we grew up in. When you finish high school and just work, you continue that cycle of a week-to-week or month-to-month paycheck. You live like that because you have no education to support your worth and support what you get paid. We broke the cycle in our family and our community of getting to another level of education. Myers: I would say the culture, the alumni \u2014 we have a big alumni network. I know if you go to a variety of HBCUs when you meet somebody, it\u2019s an immediate connection whether or not it\u2019s on a professional level or whether or not it\u2019s on a friendship level, you immediately have that bond. And I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to keep in touch with many of my friends that I went to school with throughout the years. Tom Washington: There\u2019s an underlying understanding that, culturally, you tend to know what challenges I may or may not face. You learn to be able to sit down with someone and express your challenges \u2014 where your areas of need or strength may be. [At an HBCU] they\u2019re able to point that out more readily. I do think that had I gone somewhere else, then we would have eventually gotten to that point, but I think that sometimes you\u2019d get there just a little bit quicker because there\u2019s an underlying understanding of what may or may not be there so to speak. I hope that I, along with the other referees who attended HBCUs, actually become somewhat of a role model, showing that there are HBCU grads who are successful. Hopefully we\u2019ve represented, not just the NBA, our families and ourselves, but the HBCU community as well. Hopefully, that\u2019s empowering and inspiring to a younger generation that may look at us and say, \u201cWhat he\u2019s done is exceptional and it\u2019s great. What school did he go to?\u201d Brown: I think the socializing environment and how culturally engaging it is for you to be who you want to be [makes the HBCU experience unique]. They basically accept everybody. There\u2019s no cookie cutter. Everybody\u2019s welcome. You learn what makes you unique. One thing I do know: the differences in all of us is what\u2019s great in all of us. Going to an HBCU, it made me feel comfortable in my own skin, and helped build my confidence to go out and be one of the best referees in the world now. It helped mold me. That\u2019s how I was fortunate enough to be where I am. It gave me the foundation to work hard, and once the opportunity presented itself, I was ready. CJ Washington: The HBCU experience is almost like a family experience. I had so many family members that went to school there. Even being able to be at school and then to go home on the weekend and have conversations with my mom or my aunts and uncles, and we talk about [the school]. To have that common sense of experience and have these discussions with people that went before you was a great thing. I can think about a few of my professors where they spoke to me as if they were my aunt or my uncle and more like I was their nephew as opposed to being my teacher. It was tough love at times and it was just comfortable. It was just so comfortable to be in a place where you were going to be completely judged on what you did, whether you were successful or not. Collins: I believe it nurtured me a lot, the environment, the challenging academic program was rich in history. The discipline that I received was second to none. You get constant encouragement from the professors, as well as your peers. They made sure that you graduated \u2026 I just remember all of the things my professors told me in regards to sticking with it, you gotta persevere. You gotta work hard. Nothing is just going to be given to you. You got to learn how to deal with adversity. I carry those characteristics with me in my career. Working in the NBA for 20 years, I just remember those lasting imprints that they gave me back then, that I carry with me now."},{"id":509042,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nike-earned-edition-jersey-indiana-pacers","date":"2021-03-07","title":"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Indiana Pacers","content":"With Victor Oladipo out much of the 2019-20 season due to a ruptured quad suffered in January 2019, T.J Warren (19.8 PPG) and Domantas Sabonis (18.5 PPG, 12.4 RPG) guided the Indiana Pacers to a 45-28 record.

His team lost that game. His current team \u2014 and a lot of others \u2014 should be big winners this time around. Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game in Atlanta is generating $3 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, through donations to scholarship funds. But the actual value to those schools will far exceed that influx of cash, with almost every All-Star element set to showcase and celebrate HBCU traditions and culture. \u201cEverything\u2019s about exposure,\u201d said Williams, who played 13 NBA seasons and now is a first-year coach at Alabama State of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. \u201cBeing that the All-Star Game is putting an emphasis on HBCUs, it gives us exposure, and it helps in a lot of different areas, a lot of different ways, a lot of different schools. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from Super Bowl commercials. People spend millions of dollars to put their commercial on the Super Bowl for the exposure. And, you know, the exposure we\u2019re getting this weekend from the NBA All-Star Game, it only can help.\u201d Those Super Bowl ads can be as short as 30 seconds. This exposure is going to last several hours \u2014 and cover almost every aspect of the NBA\u2019s midseason showcase. \u201cIt was part of the reason why we\u2019re here in Atlanta,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday. \u201cThis was an opportunity to focus on the HBCUs.\u201d The court was designed in collaboration from artists who attended HBCU schools. The famed bands from Grambling State and Florida A&M will perform during the player introductions. Clark Atlanta University\u2019s Philharmonic Society Choir will perform \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d commonly called the Black national anthem. Gladys Knight, a graduate of one of the nation\u2019s oldest HBCUs in Shaw University, will sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d The refereeing crew of Tom Washington, Tony Brown and Courtney Kirkland all are HBCU graduates. \u201cWe are here representing HBCUs and trying to shed light on their ability to dream and one day have the opportunity to follow in our footsteps,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo, this game is mainly about giving people hope and allowing them an opportunity to dream.\u201d The timing and location \u2014 Atlanta, birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King \u2014 to pay tribute to HBCUs seems right. During the past year, racial injustice has become perhaps more of a national discussion point than at any time in a generation. It also saw history, with Kamala Harris \u2014 a graduate of Howard \u2014 becoming not only the first woman to be elected vice president but the first HBCU graduate in the White House. Harris is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, one of the Divine Nine fraternities and sororities, groups that the NBA is also paying tribute to Sunday. NBA players used their platform in the league\u2019s bubble restart last summer to speak out against inequality. They were often at the center of the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many more. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about Black Lives Matter and not talk about the Historically Black Colleges and Universities,\u201d said Charles McClelland, the commissioner of the SWAC and a member of the NCAA Men\u2019s Division I Basketball Committee. \u201cA lot of these student-athletes have been talking. A lot of these professional athletes have been talking. But the platform really wasn\u2019t that great for them to be able to extend that message. This is just in a unique time, and I think we\u2019re at the right time, and I\u2019m ecstatic that it\u2019s happening at this point in time \u2014 because it\u2019s so long overdue.\u201d The NBA has just one active player who had the traditional HBCU experience: Portland\u2019s Robert Covington, who went to Tennessee State. He was invited to be part of the skills challenge, which will precede Sunday\u2019s game and typically is part of All-Star Saturday night; the events were condensed to one night this year because of the pandemic. All-Star Chris Paul, the National Basketball Players Association President and a longtime proponent of HBCUs, played at Wake Forest but is finishing his degree at Winston-Salem State. Covington realized the significance of this moment. He could have been on vacation. He went to Atlanta instead. \u201cI just want to leave a legacy,\u201d Covington said. \u201cI want to leave my mark and I want to let kids know that anything is possible.\u201d That message has resonated in recent months. Some top basketball recruits have said they were considering bucking offers from traditional powers to attend HBCUs. Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders has taken over as football coach at Jackson State, giving that school instant notoriety. And as the first half of the NBA season wound down, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers played in a pair of sneakers that paid tribute to Florida A&M \u2014 a school that just finalized a six-year deal with Nike to play in James\u2019 line of uniforms, apparel and footwear. This game will provide more boosts. \u201cThe exposure, I think, will be incredibly valuable,\u201d Silver said. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund and United Negro College Fund will collect a total of $3 million, if not more. And HBCUs everywhere will share in the investment of time on a huge platform if nothing else. \u201cTo highlight the significance of HBCUs, it is a tremendous windfall,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the money. The exposure is going to allow students to go to our member institutions, to learn about our history, to learn about our culture. What they\u2019re doing for the All-Star Game, we could not pay for and we could not duplicate.\u201d"},{"id":508993,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nike-earned-edition-boston-celtics","date":"2021-03-06","title":"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Boston Celtics","content":"The Boston Celtics signed Kemba Walker to a four-year deal during the 2019 offseason after Kyrie Irving left in free agency.

In the first section of a three-part interview, each official shares their take on why they chose their school, how their college experience shaped them personally, and what makes the HBCU experience unique. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Courtney Kirkland (Southern University): The one thing that I would share with anyone is to learn how to make friends with people, learn how to communicate with people, and learn how to get things done. Don\u2019t wait for things to happen; make sure that you connect with people, get engaged, get involved because those things help the experience go along. You can\u2019t just sit in one spot and expect things to just happen for you. You\u2019ve got to make sure that you are connected with someone, which can be in various scenarios. It could be a teammate. It could be a fraternity or sorority. It could be a book club. It could be the chess club. It could be in the science club, but the main thing I would say is making sure that a person gets connected with someone because it\u2019s impossible to go and be successful at something all alone. Sean Corbin (Coppin State University): Just about the sense of community. You go there with a purpose to be disciplined and focused. Get your education, but also learn to socialize with people and have care and compassion for people that are less fortunate than yourselves. Be able to learn to serve the community and give back to those that are less fortunate. Matt Myers (Hampton University): It really comes down to what type of experience you want to get. I encourage people to go \u2014 some of my friends and some of my family members who are looking to go into college, to attend an HBCU. Without the history of HBCUs, there wouldn\u2019t have been an opportunity for people of color to get a higher education. I think it\u2019s very important that we continue those legacies. Some HBCUs have been closed over the years because of financial problems. It\u2019s very important that we keep some of these historic schools up and operating, and many of them are thriving right now. Their attendance is up. I know a lot of kids want to go to big state schools, but I think it\u2019s very important we encourage people to go to our HBCUs. Tony Brown (Clark Atlanta University): Biggest advice I give them is what my brother gave me: put as much effort and as much work into the education as you do your extracurricular activities. It\u2019ll benefit you because education itself is key to being successful in life. Put as much effort into your education as you do in anything else, and that\u2019ll be a lasting foundation. That\u2019s one thing someone can never take away from you once you get your education. It\u2019s embedded in you. You never have to worry about someone telling you something you can\u2019t do. Bennie Adams (Southern University): It\u2019s funny. All of my younger cousins attended Southern. \u2026 I would just advise anybody that it\u2019s an excellent education. The student-to-teacher ratio is at a number where you feel included in part of the group. You have an opportunity for once in your life to learn from a number of people that are like you with students that are like you, and you can just grow and thrive in that environment, and there\u2019s nothing like that experience. Eric Lewis (Bethune-Cookman University): It\u2019s huge. My career is not a thing you study in college. It\u2019s not like a course you take in college. It shows that no matter what, I grew into something bigger, and I give credit to Bethune-Cookman for building that foundation for me to be able to make it. Because in our community, every coach is a counselor, a father. If you didn\u2019t have a father, that\u2019s how they treated you. It wasn\u2019t like you were just another player. My coach knew my mom. They had ties to our community. They had ties to us. Truly it\u2019s like one big family, so they pushed us to keep excelling. It\u2019s just having that pride to show that we made it. From all the hard work everyone pushed into me \u2014 you can see the fruits of all that right now. Kirkland: It means the world to be able to represent my school. I know that there are a lot of people who actually watched me start. There are some people that I still communicate with now, and they say, yeah, I remember when you were first starting this [refereeing] thing. They call it \u2018this thing.\u2019 And people were laughing at me \u2026 talking about me. They would laugh at me with my stripes on saying, \u2018You look like a zebra\u2019 and call me names, but later they came back and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you for sticking with it.\u2019 It really means a lot to be able to represent Southern University, because Southern although there were the games you would see on TV, you didn\u2019t get to hear the stories. Now you get to hear about Courtney Kirkland. You get to hear about Bennie Adams. You hear about CJ Washington, who\u2019s an NBA referee. They all came from Southern University. So it shows that Southern University is doing something right as it relates to NBA referees. It inspires me, and it inspires those other individuals who think that they don\u2019t stand a chance. I\u2019m here to say that there is an opportunity, and you do stand a chance. However, that means that you have to work at it, and you have to work extra hard because it\u2019s not going to just fall into your lap. And that\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019ve done personally to make sure that not only could I do this craft, but I could sustain it long-term. I put in the actual work, and no one has been able to see what I\u2019ve done behind closed doors to prepare myself for this craft. I\u2019m living proof that hard work does pay off. Brown: It gives me a sense of pride because I always want to be a role model for people who look like me. I want to be a role model for everybody, but I want to be a role model for people who look like me, who have not had the same opportunities that I had to become successful. I have a son, and his name is Basile Brown. And I tell him all the time, you know, I said, I always want you to: 1) Be respectful. Once you are a respectful person and you go out and work hard, you\u2019re living a very successful life by being a good person. I think that\u2019s the key to life. And for me, when people are at HBCUs, I want them to look at me and say, I can do that. CJ Washington (Southern University): It means a lot. I\u2019m actually the fourth graduate of Southern University to be hired as an NBA official, so I\u2019m the baby, the puppy of that small fraternity. When I think about the four that came before me \u2026 you just always want to make them proud. They poured a lot into me, and you want to carry on and continue on that tradition of excellence from Southern University.  When people think about Southern, and they think about athletics, they think about the likes of Avery Johnson. They think about Lou Brock. They think about Aeneas Williams, Mel Blount. These are all people that went on to do tremendous things in their field and Hall of Famers and Championships when you talk about Avery. You want to be at a point where they set the bar so high that you want to continue on that tradition of excellence. You want to be in a place where [people] say, where\u2019d you go to school? And you can proudly say, \u201cSouthern University.\u201d One day I can talk to someone, and they say, \u201cMan, I would like to go to Southern because you went to Southern.\u201d If you can be that type of influence on somebody, then that makes you feel good. Myers: Anytime I can shout out Hampton University \u2014 there are many different professionals who have gone to Hampton University in many different fields. I think it\u2019s cool to continue to put Hampton on the map as far as people have been in politics, doctors, business, or whatever. Hopefully, I\u2019m not the last referee that attends Hampton. Hopefully, there\u2019s another one in the near future that comes from Hampton, but I think it was pretty cool just to be a Hampton alumnus and support my alumni in the best way I can. Karl Lane (Philander Smith College): It\u2019s like a badge of honor when you succeed after coming from an HBCU, especially knowing why they were first established. And to see the NBA putting on this type of show for All-Star is just phenomenal. I just think there\u2019s a lot of African American kids growing up right now who may have previously decided against going to college, but now think that they can go to an HBCU and be comfortable with people who look like them. Derrick Collins (Xavier University): It just makes me proud knowing that I represent my culture, where I grew up, the environment where I grew up, and Xavier University. I represent them everywhere I go as an NBA referee. It just brings joy to me knowing that a lot of them are proud of me. The people that knew me, the people that don\u2019t know me say, \u201cWow, this guy grew up at Xavier University as a young kid, growing into a mature man.\u201d Now, later on in his life, they\u2019re watching the success; it just brings added confirmation that HBCU does generate quality professional people when they\u2019re long gone from the university. So, it\u2019s just living a legacy, man. It\u2019s just being able to let kids know who are thinking about going to HBCUs that it can happen for them. So for me, I\u2019m just glad that I\u2019m one of the ones out there, leading the drive now. Just expanding throughout this country, what the nurturing at HBCU at Xavier University did for me. Adams: I\u2019m very proud, very proud to be a Southern Jaguar on the court. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with two other fellow alumni of Southern in a game \u2014 Courtney Kirkland and CJ Washington \u2014 and that was one of my highest moments in the NBA. That we could share and enjoy that moment together on the court. Marc Davis (Howard): The interesting thing about our group, if I could draw a parallel, is that we are very rarely part of the general conversation. So our group of officials is already in a position of being a minority in and of itself, and if you look at the members of the HBCU community, there\u2019s a parallel experience there. I think that sense of grit, determination and connection may be underrepresented in the basketball community. We understand our importance to the game of basketball, and I think that connection to the HBCU is what is still there. Although maybe not seen as the intellectual powerhouses of academia, those who have attended recognize what has been given to them and their place in society. So I think there\u2019s a parallel there as to how we carry ourselves as NBA officials and how we\u2019re taught that through our HBCU experiences. We have to have a strong sense of self-confidence and self-worth in an environment that inherently does not provide that externally. No matter what the outside noise is, you always have a sense of self, purpose and ability so you\u2019re prepared for the moment at hand. Corbin: I think it\u2019s great. As they [the NBA] continue, the world changes. It\u2019s all about entering, introducing, and exposing people to things that they\u2019re not aware of. The NBA can pitch in the funds, but also as players and referees, we can go back in our own communities and share what this means, and continue to inform and educate people who are watching the NBA daily, but may not know the uniqueness of an HBCU. I think it\u2019s a huge thing that we\u2019ll continue to do, and people look up to us as well, even though they see us on television when you go back in your own community \u2014 people recognize. They want to know a little bit more about your background, and if you can continue to share that and educate people, I think it can be nothing but a positive and a plus. Lewis: That recognition is huge because we don\u2019t get any of this magnitude. They\u2019ll show a game or two here on TV, but it\u2019s not as huge as an SEC team playing on TV every week. We don\u2019t have the luxury of that because we don\u2019t have a huge following. We\u2019re not as marketable as the Power Five schools and the predominantly white institutions. We also don\u2019t have the revenue to upgrade facilities for it, not just from the sports aspect, but as far as the educational aspect as well. To get this extra funding is huge for us. It helps upgrade those areas and gives us a better platform to attract more people to come to those schools or motivate them to go to those schools. Kirkland: I am so glad that they are pledging support because a lot of times, the HBCUs just don\u2019t have the resources. They don\u2019t have the funding. They don\u2019t have the enrollment, and it\u2019s very challenging to get players to the universities when those players can go to other universities that have shiny environments, bigger weight rooms, better dormitories, and better meal plans. It\u2019s hard to recruit and get players there when you can go somewhere else. When you can somewhat level that playing field \u2014 meaning the environments are very similar in nature \u2014 then you have the potential to bring out the best in whoever is there. I\u2019ll mention Jackson State \u2014 when Deion Sanders took over as the head coach of their football program, you had players left and right changing their minds about the schools that they were originally going to. If he could do something at Jackson State, someone else will be able to do something at Grambling or Southern or Bethune-Cookman. If we can start bringing those resources there, we can show students and student-athletes that yes, we can compete, but also our environment is strong enough to compete with everybody else\u2019s environment too. So, it means a lot that the NBA and the NBPA are dedicating money to the HBCUs, so at least we can get the ball rolling to increase some of the resources there. Myers: It\u2019s huge. We\u2019re continuing to get recognized by big companies like the NBA and other large Fortune 500 companies that see HBCUs as a place where there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to grow. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities to reach out to the community within there. So I think it\u2019s really cool that the NBA has taken the step along with the players to see that they want to be a part of helping to grow the HBCU culture and the HBCU experience for students and alumni. CJ Washington: I\u2019m very proud that the company that I work for \u2026 they\u2019re giving back to institutions that mean a lot to me. Right. So that\u2019s big, and especially in the climate that we\u2019re in now, you know, it\u2019s kinda been a line drawn in the sand, and it\u2019s like, what side are you on? So for the NBA to say we\u2019re on the side of social justice and equality for all, and then we\u2019re going to put our money where our mouth is. That\u2019s big. I\u2019m proud to say that my employer is helping grow young Black men and women, helping give them an opportunity to be successful, to be educated, and to achieve the things in life that they strive to achieve. It makes me want to do things that I can do on the individual [level] to help somebody do the same thing. Tom Washington (Norfolk State) : It\u2019s phenomenal. It really is. It\u2019s not just a gesture. It\u2019s a remarkable symbol of their commitment to being involved and caring. I hope everyone sees it that way. I think that [support], in and of itself, is inspiring to the youth and families across the country. It could also inspire some people to look at attending an HBCU school because of that commitment there. I can\u2019t thank [the NBA] enough because it\u2019s a phenomenal and outstanding gesture on their part. Brown: It\u2019s like a positive affirmation that they know there\u2019s help that needs to be given. Their assistance is needed there. And I just think it opens doors. It\u2019s a very positive action that they\u2019re doing to help give somebody that opportunity, and just shed light on education anywhere is good, as long as you\u2019re getting one. It\u2019s key that they are saying, hey, we\u2019re planting this money to help people who wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to get an education. That is the biggest thing you can do for anybody is help them get an education. Collins: It just lets everyone know that if you\u2019re African-American that they\u2019re behind this big opportunity to express what the HBCUs do for African-Americans \u2026 Using this opportunity is great, especially in the times that we\u2019re living in now. There needs to be a lot more positive messaging sent out there for these kids that are growing up that have been isolated for the last year and a half, man. Just not being able to do the certain things that they\u2019d like to do. The messaging now will help define and shape them as they think about the future of what college they\u2019re thinking about attending. Davis: All the recognition is a connection with the level of professionalism, the quality level of education HBCU provides. The fact that now the NBA, once again, is able to use their platform to bring attention to those universities, to bring attention to that community is profound. And I think the Players Association, along with the NBRA, as well as the NBA\u2019s participation in this year\u2019s All-Star Game to promote and to project and to kind of open the world\u2019s eyes to the HBCU, both historically and in the future, what they can accomplish, I think is phenomenal. And once again, just speaks to our business and our sport of basketball always being out in front. We need an educated society. Facts matter, intellect matters, the ability to have critical thoughts matter, the ability to be a critical thinker matters, to be able to engage and articulate your opinions matters in our society more than ever. Because the less we focus on intellectual advancement and more we retract to more emotional conversations, I think is helpful for us as a nation. And I think the NBA, through transparency and Adam Silver\u2019s leadership has given so many people a voice. This is just another part of that voice. Corbin: It\u2019s all about exposure. The more kids find out that they can attend school and it doesn\u2019t always have to be Yale or Harvard or schools that you always hear about. A debit and a credit are the same at Coppin State as it is at Harvard. The education may be just a little different because the people are different, but the unique experience you have going to an HBCU is priceless. You have to be there to experience it, but the more we can let kids know that those kinds of schools are available to you, and that it\u2019s another avenue, I think it can be nothing but a positive. Myers: I\u2019ve read bios about coaches and some trainers, and I see some HBCU schools pop up there. So I see it more, maybe on the operations and the team side. I hope one day we get more players that have attended and will come out of HBCUs. We only have [Portland Trail Blazer and Tennessee State University alum] Robert Covington [in the NBA right now]. If we can get more players and get more exposure to the basketball programs and help them get kids into the NBA Draft, that would be huge. Tom Washington: We\u2019ve always had some players who represent HBCUs, and they get mentioned along the way. Bobby Dandridge is probably the most famous Norfolk State Spartan who played in the NBA. Then there are guys like Charles Oakley and Rick Mahorn [who also went to HBCUs]. So I think when those guys get mentioned, you understand that it\u2019s not mandatory to go to a big Division I school to get the NBA, and I think that helps inspire our kids as well. Even this year, we had some high-level players commit to HBCU schools where before, that was never heard of. People may have thought before you might not have a chance to make it to the NBA if you go that route, but the narrative is changing. If you\u2019re good enough, they will find you. So it was inspiring and humbling to me that kids are starting to look at HBCUs as a viable option. I think there\u2019s progress, and we feel that we\u2019re on the same level as bigger-named schools for that reason. But if nothing else, at least we\u2019re not excluded. There\u2019s inclusion there \u2014 that\u2019s awesome. Lane: I think it\u2019s becoming more of an avenue \u2014 especially for those students who maybe want to pursue a professional career in any kind of sport. Deion Sanders taking over Jackson State University [football] has been a big boost. And there have been others who have taken head coaching jobs that have helped make progress. And I think kids are maybe seeing now that maybe you don\u2019t have to go to a big-time university to be able to further my playing career in professional sports. Adams: I\u2019ve seen a lot of people in different positions, not just officiating, but in broadcast, like the late [NBA TV talent and NBA.com writer] Sekou Smith, or in team jobs becoming coaches. The visibility this next generation of players brings in light to the HBCU experience, highlights the schools with the paraphernalia that they wear in interviews and as they enter the arenas. That\u2019s been special to watch with this latest initiative. It\u2019s been cool. Davis: Two or three of the first five African Americans to have a career in the NBA were graduates of HBCUs. So, I do see some improvement. I don\u2019t see us recruiting predominantly from that space, but there has been a connection. Particularly, I think about how refereeing is a very fraternal profession and very organic in that you never want for a lack of mentors. I know for a while Southern University had a strong officiating system through intramurals, and as a result, had quite a few successful people come out of that program. I haven\u2019t seen any improvement, per se, because we\u2019ve been on the forefront from the beginning. I think the officiating community and the NBA has always been connected to the HBCU community. I\u2019ve never seen it as a negative, because that connection has always been there.

This is where the annual midseason basketball carnival is retrofitted to slide snuggly inside a Chevy Volt with legroom to spare. Hey, isn\u2019t the game being overtaken by smaller players anyway? It seems the All-Star weekend is merely catching up to the size trend. Actually: This is a one-time-only, one-day affair (fingers crossed), given that society remains in the stretch run (fingers crossed) of a global health crisis and therefore the NBA is wisely playing this as safe and scaled-down as possible. The \u201cweekend\u201d normally runs Friday through Sunday. But the 2021 spectacle will last roughly six hours, starting in the afternoon with the Taco Bell Skills Challenge and AT&T Slam Dunk and MTN DEW 3-Point Contest all serving as same-day appetizers to the Game itself, which means not long after church is out Sunday, basketball fans can continue their worshipping at the NBA altar. Maybe you\u2019ve heard a few All-Star players voicing concerns about the game, but that was weeks ago, and there have been crickets ever since. If anything, all the slander is now being directed at the league-leading Utah Jazz, courtesy of team captains LeBron James and Kevin Durant, who (playfully) explained why they kept Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert sitting in the green room of the All-Star Game draft, long after everyone else was chosen and went to sleep for the night. And in keeping with the last-one theme, Mike Conley was chosen as a late injury replacement for Devin Booker. Once the game draws near, and especially when the ball goes up, players play. (Unfortunately, however, 76ers stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will not play in the All-Star Game after they were in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.) Every single active member of Team LeBron and Team Durant, and every single player who wasn\u2019t selected for the All-Star Game, are at this level because of their love for the game. And that doesn\u2019t change a bit, even when there are challenges. That love conquers all. NBA commissioner Adam Silver probably sensed this when he and Turner, which holds broadcast rights, decided to move forward with the All-Star Game. All the necessary precautionary measures are being taken to insure, as much as possible, safety for everyone involved. Yes, of course, the league made a business decision here, but also there\u2019s the task of continuing the All-Star tradition for the 70th time while stoking the basketball appetite of the customers, who cannot attend the game but need to keep the game on the brain during this week-long midseason break. This was originally scheduled for Indianapolis, but the plug was pulled on those plans almost a year ago for contractual reasons. In a pinch, State Farm Arena was not only available, but a hotel (the Omni) is attached to the building and therefore the setup makes for a safe and seamless entryway for all participants. The Weekend, much like last year\u2019s playoffs, is being bubble-ized. So, what to expect? For starters, the league is paying homage to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, better known as HBCUs. Atlanta is the hub for HBCUs, with Morehouse and Spelman and Clark Atlanta colleges located just a 3-point shot away from the arena. And in this racially-uplifting climate, it seems proper and progressive to lend support for colleges and students who historically have been marginalized in the larger scheme. Additionally, the players, many of whom are Black, are all-in for the HBCUs. (Full disclosure: Only one active NBA player, Robert Covington of the Trail Blazers, actually attended an HBCU. But the other 99.999% of the players are aligned with HBCUs in spirit this weekend and therefore qualify as \u201chonorary graduates.\u201d) The artsy All-Star Game court was designed with the cooperation of HBCU alums, and the NBA and its partners are committed to an initial donation of $3 million to the schools (the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and UNCF are the big beneficiaries). The three referees working the game all attended HBCUs. There will be 1,500 front line workers, community partners, HBCU alums and students and faculty in the stands. The entertainment, sauced up by the fraternities and sororities, will be courtesy of HBCUs. The entire day will feel like an HBCU homecoming \u2014 without the football game, obviously. As for the event itself, it\u2019s possible the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest could steal the night. The lineup is solid: Steph Curry, Conley, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine and Mitchell. Curry is the natural draw and the favorite, especially given the noticeable last-minute loss of Booker, also a former 3-Point Contest champ. Still, LaVine and Mitchell are vying to become the first player to win the Slam Dunk and 3-Point competitions. Speaking of the AT&T Slam Dunk: The big names aren\u2019t here, and this contest was perhaps affected more than the others because of the compacted weekend \u2014 and also because it\u2019ll be held at halftime of the All-Star Game. Still, a young contestant has the chance to earn 15 minutes of dunk fame, whether that proves to be Obi Toppin of the Knicks, Anfernee Simons of the Blazers or the Pacers\u2019 Cassius Stanley. The Taco Bell Skills Challenge gets Paul, Covington, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic and Luka Doncic, and the curiosity will focus on the big men to see if they can even begin to compete with the likes of supreme ballhandlers Paul and Doncic. Once again the All-Star Game will typically feature the league elite, and speaking of that, this event is unofficially the guaranteed extra game on the schedule for LeBron. That\u2019s because, with the exception of his rookie season, he\u2019s played \u2018em all. This will be his 17th start, extending his NBA record \u2014 no other player has started more than 13 \u2014 and only Kobe Bryant (18) has played in more consecutive games. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 19 career games is the most in NBA history, but that\u2019s in serious jeopardy of being tied next season when the game becomes the 83rd on the schedule for LeBron. James\u2019 Sunday teammate, Chris Paul, has been an All-Star with four teams: New Orleans, the Clippers, OKC and now the Suns. Only Moses Malone and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who also represented four teams, spread as much All-Star love around. On the other end are five first-timers: Conley, LaVine, Julius Randle, Jaylen Brown and the youngest, Zion Williamson, who becomes the first All-Star born in the 2000s. (Yes, that makes you feel old.) Zion will be 20 years and 244 days at tipoff, making him the fourth-youngest All-Star in history after Kobe, LeBron and Magic Johnson. Those three went on to have stellar careers, as you know, and in the case of LeBron, his is still in progress. There\u2019s also a record nine international players, and five voted as starters, proof that the game\u2019s global reach is digging even deeper. You can trace the roots of the international invasion back three decades and to Arvydas Sabonis, who happens to be the proud father of Domantas. So that\u2019s the general makeup of the game, which will have five players who\u2019ve combined to win 10 of the last 12 regular-season MVPs (Curry, LeBron, Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo), and three who\u2019ve combined to win eight of the last nine NBA Finals MVPs (LeBron, Durant and Kawhi Leonard). Maybe Team LeBron is the favorite, if only because Giannis is a believer. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s over guys. Me, LeBron, Luka, Jokic and Steph? Man, that\u2019s a good starting five.\u201d There was a chance that none of this would happen, given the pandemic and the unusual challenges just to play regular-season games without calling for a cancellation. But the league was determined to pull this off, and once a system was put in place with health as the priority, the ball will be tossed around 8 ET on Sunday. If it\u2019s successful and all goes without incident, it will qualify as yet another accomplishment by the NBA, which held an issue-free postseason on the Disney campus in Orlando last fall. An issue-free All-Star Sunday would be worth celebrating, at least until the regular season resumes Wednesday and the challenges start all over again. And when the second half of the season starts, the Jazz and their three All-Stars will put all the playful slander behind them. Utah, you see, owns the NBA\u2019s best record at the All-Star break for the first time in franchise history. Which means, Mitchell, Gobert and Conley aren\u2019t pulling up the rear when it comes to what\u2019s most important. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Of the players who exclusively have come off the bench this season, averaging at least 15 minutes, Clarkson is the leading scorer at 17.9 ppg. And scoring seems to be the most valued skill in winners of this award. Last year\u2019s winner, Montrezl Harrell, is averaging four fewer points and grabbing only 2.6 more rebounds than the 6-foot-4 Clarkson. The Jazz reserve has a green light when he enters, reliant on coach Quin Snyder to turn it red on those rare occasions he\u2019s not hitting. Clarkson also is making 96.7 percent of his free throws, daring you to contest aggressively. Shaun Powell : Jordan Clarkson is scoring 17.9 ppg in just 26 minutes and providing the turbo boost that Utah needs whenever it\u2019s time to give Donovan Mitchell a breather. He has found a home with the Jazz and a role that suits him perfectly. Like most elite sixth men, he needs little warm-up time. That said, Montrezl Harrell, the reigning sixth man winner, is doing a solid follow-up job with the Lakers. John Schuhmann :  Thaddeus Young, Chicago Bulls. Jordan Clarkson has scored 141 more points off the bench than any other player, and the ingenuity of his bucket-getting has been one of the most enjoyable aspects of this season. But Young has averaged 12.1 points (on 60% shooting), 5.9 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.4 steals off the bench for the Bulls. Furthermore, while the Jazz have been slightly better with Clarkson on the bench, the Bulls have 12.9 points per 100 possessions better with Young on the floor (+6.6) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (-6.3). No player is responsible for everything that happens when they\u2019re in the game, but the Bulls have won five games this season in which they\u2019ve been outscored (or tied) with Young off the floor. That\u2019s been the case for the Jazz and Clarkson only three times. Michael C. Wright : Is this even a debate at this point? Jordan Clarkson takes this thing in a landslide from this vantage point. Clarkson averages a career-high 17.9 ppg off Utah\u2019s bench, which for the most part has been obliterating opponents. Despite coming off the bench and playing 26 minutes per game, the man is the team\u2019s second-leading scorer and leads the league in bench scoring.

But I\u2019m going micro and  focusing on Lakers big man Anthony Davis\u2019 troublesome Achilles and calf injury. Davis only has played 23 of 37 games, missing the final nine and 11 of 13 heading into the break. Now, the idea of all that idle time is for the leg to heal and Davis to be ready to go. But if it becomes a nagging thing or, ugh, worsens, the defending champions suddenly will be cast into a far dimmer playoffs light. Shaun Powell : I\u2019ll be curious to see which direction the Celtics go. To put it mildly, it\u2019s been a first half to forget, given the injury to Marcus Smart and the terrible defeats this team endured to some lesser teams. How can a team with a pair of All-Stars look so meek, sometimes twice a week? Even with the defection of Gordon Hayward to the Hornets, the Celtics expected better results than this. Sticking with the East, I\u2019m also anxious to see the true formidability of the Nets. Because of Kevin Durant\u2019s extended absence, the scoring onslaught of Brooklyn\u2019s Notorious B.I.G. Three hasn\u2019t been fully unleashed. Can they reach 175 points in a game? You know, just for fun? Now that they\u2019re playing defense, the Nets are trending up in the East and the conference could be theirs to lose. John Schuhmann :  Brooklyn\u2019s ability to minimize mistakes. The numbers, thus far, confirm the idea that Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving is the best collection of offensive talent that we\u2019ve ever seen. The 118.2 points per 100 possessions that the Nets have scored leads the league and they\u2019ve had all three guys available for just seven games. The Nets\u2019 effective field goal percentage (58.8%) is the highest in NBA history, but they\u2019ve run into trouble with turnovers and, obviously, with defense. If they can limit their mistakes, both in regard to taking care of the ball and switching defensively, they\u2019re the best team in the league. Michael C. Wright : It might not qualify as the \u201ctop\u201d storyline, but the most fascinating seems to be how the Brooklyn Nets continue to grow throughout the season. There might not be another team in the NBA with a higher ceiling, and James Harden\u2019s chameleon-like ability to morph into whatever the Nets need him to be plays a significant role. \u201cWhen James is being James, it makes our job a lot easier,\u201d Kyrie Irving said Mar. 1 after Harden put up his seventh triple-double since joining the Nets in an overtime win over San Antonio. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve got to get used to somebody special like that in terms of breaking records. I can\u2019t wait to be right alongside him, my name in Nets history, and all the guys on our team where we\u2019re just breaking records as a team, and then, individually, we\u2019re stacking up with some of the best to ever play.\u201d The scariest part is the trio of Harden, Irving and Kevin Durant have played in just seven games so far this season, and the Nets aren\u2019t far behind the 76ers for the lead in the Eastern Conference. Right now, it just looks like the Brooklyn Nets are capable of reaching a level that no other team in the NBA is capable of \u2014 in either conference. Obviously, winning comes down to much more than just talent.

Yes, the same guy who is going to be my end-of-season choice, barring something crazy. Ball has breathed life into the Hornets, playing \u2014 as numerous coaches have said \u2014 not just like the NBA\u2019s top newcomer but a star in a rapidly approaching future. He quickly achieved that special status few rookies experience when his play started impacting Charlotte\u2019s winning. He does what it takes on a given night, and his unselfishness sets a standard from which a lot of veteran players could learn. Shaun Powell : LaMelo Ball is almost living up to the hype , which began when he was what, 6 years old? The kid is making highlight plays and is fun to watch. Remember, this game is also about entertainment and he actually has folks tuning in to the Hornets. Imagine that. His shooting was a major question coming into the season, yet those fears have subsided because he\u2019s been better from deep than anyone thought (and is top 10 in steals). Love me some Tyrese Haliburton, too. John Schuhmann :  LaMelo Ball. The highlights and the boxscore numbers are obviously there. Ball has also been relatively efficient; his true shooting percentage of 56.1% is below the league average (57.2%), but ranks sixth among 13 rookies with at least 200 field goal attempts. He\u2019s helping the Hornets, who\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s fourth biggest jump in point differential per 100 possessions, stay competitive in the East. Gordon Hayward has made a big impact and Charlotte has seen marked improvement from Terry Rozier, Miles Bridges and Malik Monk. But Ball\u2019s playmaking has played a role in that improvement. He\u2019s the real deal and not just a guy who makes fancy passes. Michael C. Wright : The experts cautioned during the NBA draft process that LaMelo Ball could turn out to be a bust, but the 19-year-old has proved everybody wrong with his elite skillset, playmaking ability and sense of confidence that seems to rub off on the rest of the team. Ball leads all rookies in scoring (15.7 ppg) and assists (6.4), basically forcing his way into the starting lineup by Feb. 1 by making the most of the opportunities he was given. Hornets coach James Borrego raves about Ball\u2019s ability to make passes and reads on all three levels, which is rare for a rookie. Besides that, Ball is just flat out fun to watch."},{"id":507347,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/who-is-your-midseason-defensive-player-of-the-year","date":"2021-03-05","title":"Blogtable: Who is your midseason Defensive Player of the Year?","content":"* * * Who is your midseason Defensive Player of the Year? * * * Steve Aschburner : Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz. It\u2019s largely a matter of taste \u2014 great big-man defense or great on-ball defense \u2014 so if you prefer the latter, then someone like Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons might be the choice here. But a rim protector and helper like Gobert can make his four teammates on the floor at any given time better defensively, too. Gives them confidence, assures them that if they get beat, their man still faces a huge obstacle to scoring, empowers them to dart into passing lanes, you name it. Gobert is deserving of his third DPOY award in four years. Shaun Powell : I\u2019m not suffering from Giannis Fatigue. The reigning DPOY is once again menacing players tall and small and hey, Giannis Antetokounmpo should be the front-runner on his tenacious block of Ivica Zubac\u2019s two-handed dunk attempt the other day. Obviously there are others worthy of mention: Ben Simmons of course, although he may not be the best defender on his own team (Embiid); Dejounte Murray; Jrue Holiday; Draymond Green. John Schuhmann :  Rudy Gobert . The two-time DPOY has his flaws. He\u2019s not the most mobile big and he wasn\u2019t able to stop Joel Embiid in a head-to-head matchup on Wednesday. But the league\u2019s fourth-ranked defense (there\u2019s only a 0.1 point-per-100-possession difference between the defenses ranked 2-4) is built entirely around Gobert\u2019s ability to protect the rim. The Jazz have a pretty good defender (Derrick Favors) backing him up, and, as the starter, Gobert is generally defending against better offensive players. But the Jazz have allowed 6.5 fewer points per 100 possessions with Gobert on the floor (103.8) than they have with him off the floor (110.3). Despite the mobility issues, he continues to rank among the league\u2019s best isolation defenders . Michael C. Wright : Watching the New Orleans Pelicans wreck the Utah Jazz for 74 points in the paint on March 1 initially presented some second thoughts about this choice, but Rudy Gobert is the frontrunner to win his third Kia Defensive Player of the Year Award. Backcourt players and wings may be sexier picks here because they\u2019re often called upon to guard an opponent\u2019s top scorer, but you can\u2019t deny how important Gobert is to everything Utah does on that end of the floor. His presence inside and help defense shuts down whole offenses, and that\u2019s a major factor in Utah\u2019s win-loss record, not to mention the fact the Jazz rank near the top of the league in several defensive categories."},{"id":507352,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/utahs-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-fined-for-conduct-criticism-of-officials","date":"2021-03-05","title":"Utah's Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert fined for conduct, criticism of officials","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell has been fined $25,000 for public criticism of the officiating and his conduct while exiting the playing court and Jazz center Rudy Gobert has been fined $20,000 for public criticism of the officiating, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Sometimes we voters get cute with this award, focusing on a mediocre team\u2019s improvement. That approach would suggest New York\u2019s Tom Thibodeau, credited with changing the Knicks\u2019 work ethic and culture even as they hover around .500 and eye the postseason. That\u2019s fine, but you have to intentionally look past Snyder, whose Jazz have been dominant (still haven\u2019t lost 10 games) and done so with, well, the last two All-Stars picked on the playground. Without the gaudy record that owes itself in good part to Snyder\u2019s hand on and off the court, either Rudy Gobert or Donovan Mitchell probably wouldn\u2019t have been picked by the coaches anyway. Shaun Powell : Quin Snyder is pushing all the right buttons in Utah , where the Jazz are thriving in what is clearly the tougher conference. His system is maximizing the shooting talent of the rotation without neglecting the presence of Rudy Gobert, who gets about 10-12 or so touches and stays happy. Once the Jazz hit their stride in January, the accelerator stayed pressed, and look who\u2019s living in the NBA penthouse right now. Also: Can\u2019t ignore how Doc Rivers is giving the Sixers some realistic title hope. John Schuhmann :  Quin Snyder. The Jazz are the only team that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They have the league\u2019s fourth-ranked offense even though their leading scorer (Donovan Mitchell) hasn\u2019t been that sharp offensively (he\u2019s well below average in regard to efficiency). Their 3-point shooting (they\u2019re third in 3-point percentage and first in the percentage of their shots that have been 3s ) is a product of their system as much as it is a product of having great shooters. They rank fourth defensively with one great defender and a couple of pretty good ones. There are a lot of coaches doing great jobs under tough circumstances this season, but when the best team in the league doesn\u2019t have one (or more) of the league\u2019s biggest talents, the coach is going to get rewarded. Michael C. Wright : First, let\u2019s list the worthy names deserving mention. Those include Steve Nash, Quin Snyder, Greg Popovich, Doc Rivers and Tom Thibodeau. All have done phenomenal jobs through the first half of the season with their respective teams, and in many cases, worked through challenging situations, which has become the norm throughout the pandemic. But what we\u2019re seeing out of Phoenix is special as Monty Williams has quickly established a culture of accountability within that organization. We caught the first glimpses last summer when the Suns rolled through the field at the NBA bubble to post an 8-0 record. Everything just carried over into this season. Obviously, a major component of coaching is X\u2019s and O\u2019s, but the great coaches leave a mark on the players and the organization. When you talk to any of the Suns players, they quickly quote many of Williams\u2019 sayings such as: \u201cEverything we want is on the other side of hard.\u201d The players have bought in, and you can see and feel a vibe of accountability from both the staff and the players. That\u2019s all manifested itself on the court in the form of Phoenix\u2019s immense success."},{"id":507297,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-is-your-midseason-mvp","date":"2021-03-05","title":"Blogtable: Who is your midseason MVP?","content":"* * * Who is your midseason MVP? * * * Steve Aschburner : Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers. This is the Embiid we\u2019ve been waiting to see: The giant who is healthy, is in the best shape of his career and is fully motivated at both ends of the floor. Took awhile but, at least for this moment in time, he got there. Embiid\u2019s stats overall, the way he has embraced his matchups and the Sixers\u2019 spot atop the East definitely are MVP-worthy. Check out just this one: With five 40 point-10 rebound games this season, the big fella has as many as the rest of the league combined. Shaun Powell : It\u2019s LeBron James , the rare player who\u2019s not only on an elite level through 17 years, but in at least one way he\u2019s even better \u2014 as a high-volume shooter from deep. All the greats bring a different wrinkle or an improved weapon each year, and LeBron is now pulling up from 25 feet comfortably. He\u2019s even more important to the Lakers with Anthony Davis out. That said, by season\u2019s end, I might slide over to Joel Embiid, who\u2019s gaining on LeBron quickly. John Schuhmann :  Joel Embiid. The Sixers\u2019 big man has been a force on both ends of the floor, among the top candidates for both Defensive Player of the Year and an imaginary \u201cOffensive Player of the Year\u201d award. His passing out of the post still needs improvement, but right now, Embiid is registering the fourth highest true shooting percentage ( 64.6% ) for any player in NBA who\u2019s averaged 30 points per game (behind only Stephen Curry\u2019s 2015-16 season and two seasons from Adrian Dantley). And that\u2019s with him often having to space the floor (only 52% of his shots have come in the paint), because his point guard doesn\u2019t shoot from outside the paint. On the other end, he\u2019s the foundation for the league\u2019s fifth-ranked defense . The Sixers are 23-7 with Embiid and 1-5 without him. And they\u2019ve been 17.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (+11.1) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (-6.3). Michael C. Wright : Nobody has established themselves as the clear frontrunner, and all season I\u2019ve been waffling back and forth between LeBron James and Joel Embiid. Depending on the day, it\u2019s a different guy for me. But based off how the end of the first half has played out, Embiid gets the nod here (that could change as quickly as tomorrow for me). James is doing all he can for the Lakers, putting together his eighth game of the season during a Mar. 3 loss to the Suns in which he put up 30 points or more to go with 5-plus rebounds and 5-plus assists. That ties with James Harden for third-most in the NBA with just Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic producing more games with that stat line. But the Lakers are just 5-5 this season without Anthony Davis in the lineup, and it didn\u2019t help that Dennis Schroder missed four games during the team\u2019s four-game skid to close out February. A lot of people like to make this race about statistics. While they should definitely be considered when determining the MVP, team success should be equally important. Jokic probably doesn\u2019t receive enough recognition in this conversation. Statistically, Jokic and Embiid are very similar. But it comes down to winning. We should count on players like Doncic, Harden, Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard becoming more prominent candidates in the race as the second half of the season progresses."},{"id":507145,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-denver-nuggets","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Denver Nuggets","content":"First half summary: Coming off a trip to the Western Conference finals, the Denver Nuggets haven\u2019t quite lived up to expectations, sitting in sixth place in the Western Conference at the All-Star break with a 21-15 record. But the Nuggets have been one of the league\u2019s most improved teams statistically, 3.2 points per 100 possessions better than they were last season. With a fast-break blunder against the Washington Wizards being the lowlight, the Nuggets are just 7-9 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, with five of those losses coming to the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. Nikola Jokic has been a Kia MVP candidate, averaging 27.1 ppg, 11.0 rpg and 8.6 apg. With the second highest true shooting percentage among high-usage players, he\u2019s led the Nuggets to a top-seven spot in offensive efficiency for a fifth straight season. As always, questions start with a defense that ranks 14th at the break, having allowed opponents to shoot a league-high 70% in the restricted area. The Nuggets are 15-0 (with wins over the Sixers, Warriors, Suns, Lakers and Bucks) when they\u2019ve allowed fewer points per 100 possessions than the league average (111.4). If they get stops, they get wins. Biggest question going into the second half: Is Michael Porter Jr. ready? A year ago, Porter was still getting DNPs, struggling to retain the trust of Nuggets coach Michael Malone. He earned a permanent spot in the rotation with his play in the bubble and has been a solid scorer (14.6 ppg on an effective field goal percentage of 61.1%) this season. If the Nuggets were to go big-game hunting in the trade market, Porter would certainly be at the center of a deal. But he also has the potential to be another star in Denver and an ideal complement to Jokic and Jamal Murray. It\u2019s a question of consistency and improvement on defense, where Porter will continue to be targeted by Denver opponents. Porter, Murray and Jokic are just 22, 24 and 26 years old, respectively and the Nuggets shouldn\u2019t necessarily be in a rush. But given how special a season Jokic is having, there\u2019s no time like the present for Porter to take that next step. Playoffs or lottery?: The Nuggets are a playoff team, but they have some work to do to finish in the top six in the West and avoid the play-in scenario. Their ceiling is high and they can get back to the conference finals (or even further should the Lakers stumble) if they put it all together. But their floor is low (see those five losses to Sacramento and Washington), there are a lot of great teams in the West, and they probably can\u2019t count on Murray repeating last year\u2019s playoff performance. Murray has begun to look more like that player over the last few weeks, helping the Nuggets finish their pre-break schedule with nine wins in their last 13 games. The second half of the season will be about defense, consistency, closing games, and the continued development of Porter. If things go right, the Nuggets can beat the best teams in the league. If things go wrong, they can lose to the worst. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":506355,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-minnesota-timberwolves","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Minnesota Timberwolves","content":"First half summary: Can\u2019t the Timberwolves and the fans still paying attention to them just erase the first half of 2020-21? It\u2019s hard to imagine things going any worse for the team with the league\u2019s worst record (7-29). The Wolves skulked into All-Star break on a nine-game losing streak, with one coach (Ryan Saunders) fired and his replacement (Chris Finch) still in search of his first victory after an 0-5 how-do-you-do. There have been some positives to grab onto. Rookie Anthony Edwards, the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft, has displayed athletic brilliance, even as he learns how to play at the NBA level. Wing Malik Beasley, before he was suspended for 12 games by the league due to his guilty plea in an armed felony case, had shown signs of plugging another hole. Rookie Jalen McDaniels has been a consistent help and Jarred Vanderbilt a nice surprise since arriving last February. And \u2026 that\u2019s about it. Biggest questions going into the second half: Was hiring Finch the right move at the right time? And what does the future portend for Karl-Anthony Towns in Minnesota? Just because this season seemed over for the Wolves almost from the start \u2014 let\u2019s be honest and acknowledge that Saunders would not have been hired as coach when he was by any of the other 29 teams \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean that grabbing Finch off Toronto\u2019s bench is a no-brainer upgrade. Finch is considered an offensive innovator, so he\u2019ll be charged with developing Edwards and synching things up with Towns and D\u2019Angelo Russell (when he finally comes back from leg surgery). But the Wolves have been just as bad defensively, where David Vanterpool \u2014 the assistant passed over for promotion \u2014 wasn\u2019t getting decent results, either. Towns is in his sixth season. He has been beset with COVID-19 concerns, from the death of his mother and several others close to him as well as his own bout with the virus. A two-time All-Star, his reputation has dimmed due to injuries and the Wolves\u2019 losing. He\u2019s in the second year of a contract that has three years and $101 million remaining, but besides Edwards, he\u2019s the Timberwolf most marketable for serious rebuilding assets. Playoffs or lottery?: Take a wild guess. Getting a bunch of ping pong balls might excite some people, but the thrill of having three of the past seven No. 1 picks (Edwards, Towns and Andrew Wiggins) come through their roster hasn\u2019t saved Minnesota from losing or regime and coaching changes. Finch, boss Gersson Rosas and their staffs have to treat the second half of the season and however many months are left before 2021-22 as an extended developmental program\/training camp. Games need to be used like practices, mistakes will turn into defeats, but there is no other viable option for the woeful Wolves. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":506455,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-houston-rockets","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Houston Rockets","content":"First half summary: New coach Stephen Silas didn\u2019t deserve this, and he certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to lose two former Kia MVPs in Russell Westbrook and James Harden. That\u2019s not even taking into account all the drama that started with Westbrook\u2019s trade request, followed by an uninterested Harden arriving late to training camp on Dec. 8, and immediately entering the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols due to his hard-partying ways. The situation reached a crescendo when Harden, who had been rumored to have asked for a trade, flat out told the media that the Rockets were \u201cjust not good enough\u201d to compete for titles. The Rockets, who had previously sent Westbrook to Washington for John Wall, eventually moved Harden to the Brooklyn Nets in a deal that would land them Victor Oladipo. Houston is now expected to rely heavily on budding star Christian Wood, who was playing at an All-Star level before severely rolling his ankle on Feb. 4. Wood returned to on-court activities at the end of February, but let\u2019s be real here: his pending return to the floor won\u2019t salvage Houston\u2019s season because the Rockets are virtually a new team with a new coaching staff and no real star power. Houston needs more time to build chemistry between the holdovers and new additions such as Wall, Oladipo and Wood in Silas\u2019 new system. The Rockets amassed a six-game winning streak in January, but they\u2019ve lost too much ground in the rugged West to get back into playoff contention. It\u2019s quite telling, as colleague John Schuhmann points out , Houston\u2019s most-used lineup this season has played a total of 58 minutes and includes Harden, who was traded on Jan. 14 . Biggest question going into the second half: What\u2019s Houston\u2019s plan for the post-Harden era? The trades of Harden and Westbrook dramatically shifted the landscape for the future in Houston, sending the club into a major transitional state. Perhaps we caught somewhat of a glimpse of the Rockets\u2019 plan under new general manager Rafael Stone when ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Oladipo recently turned down a two-year $45.2 million maximum extension, which was the most Houston could offer before the end of the regular season. Oladipo, therefore, could be a candidate to move at the March 25 trade deadline. It appears the Rockets are on the way to a rebuild and are acquiring assets. They received four first-round picks and four pick swaps in the Harden trade, and gained three first-rounders in trades involving Westbrook and Robert Covington, who was moved to Portland back in November for Trevor Ariza, the No. 16 pick in the 2020 draft (Isaiah Stewart), and a protected first rounder in the 2021 draft. Houston immediately traded Ariza and the 2020 No. 16 pick to Detroit for another protected 2021 first-round pick. Houston could wind up stacking more assets by wheeling and dealing once the trade deadline market picks up, as veterans such as Eric Gordon and P.J. Tucker don\u2019t appear at this point to be in the Rockets\u2019 long-term future plans. Playoffs or lottery?: Houston is headed to the lottery, as its second-half schedule appears to be a meat grinder with three remaining matchups on deck against the Utah Jazz, two against the LA Clippers and one set for the Lakers. But perhaps the lottery is where Houston needs to be once this season comes to conclusion, as it appears to be starting what could become an arduous process of pulling off a complete rebuild. Wood is poised to become an All-Star, and Wall is finally fully recovered from injury and ready to serve as Houston\u2019s floor general for the next few seasons. Stone has already uncovered some young talent for the Rockets in Jae\u2019Sean Tate, who has started 21 games as a rookie and Kevin Porter Jr., a head turner so far in the NBA G League bubble that is expected to rejoin Houston after the All-Star break. It\u2019s not like the cupboard in Houston is completely bare. Stone needs to pull off some moves to restock it, though. \u2014 Michael C.

That injury sidelined Morant for eight contests. But in his absence, the Grizzlies\u2019 depth showed up in a major way, fighting to a record of 4-4 without their star point guard. Morant returned to action on Jan. 26 with Memphis riding a three-game winning streak, and the Grizzlies rolled to four consecutive victories from there \u2026 before enduring a four-game skid to start off February. The Grizzlies remain in contention for a postseason spot, and players continue to come off the injury report. That means Memphis at some point will be finally whole during the second half of the season. In the meantime, the Grizzlies came into March ranked No. 2 in bench points per game (41.0), first in bench steals (4.4) and fourth in bench 3-point shooting percentage (39.7). Memphis\u2019 reserves scored a franchise-record 85 points in the team\u2019s 133-84 drubbing of the Houston Rockets on Feb. 28, marking the first time since Feb. 2, 2013 that a team\u2019s bench outscored its opponent\u2019s entire lineup. Memphis is targeting a March return for Jackson, while Winslow debuted Feb. 20 \u2014 more than a year after he was acquired in a trade with Miami \u2014 and finished the month with his best performance (20 points on 8-of-12 shooting) thus far in a 45-point rout of the Rockets. Biggest question going into the second half: Can Memphis fully implement the players returning from injury in time to make a serious playoff push? Memphis sat at .500 after the first 30 games, and the combined winning percentage of the teams remaining on the schedule for the next 42 games was .499. It\u2019s worth noting Memphis faces a brutal portion of the schedule from March 24 to April 26. Of their 20 games in that stretch, 15 are on the road including two with Utah, Denver and Portland in addition to one with Philadelphia, Miami, Milwaukee and the LA Clippers. And there are five back-to-back sets in that mix, too. To survive the second half, the Grizzlies will need better shooting from Morant and Dillon Brooks, while Jackson needs to hit the ground running upon his return. Winslow\u2019s progression needs to continue, too, as Memphis gradually ramps up his workload. Jonas Valanciunas is averaging a double-double with a career-high 15.6 ppg and 11.3 rpg, which has been key in Memphis leading the league in points in the paint (55.3). Playoffs or lottery?: Memphis landed strong top four lottery picks in 2018 and 2019 with Jackson and Morant, and it\u2019s likely the Grizzlies will be headed back there after narrowly missing the playoffs again this season. The Grizzlies will likely be in the Play-In Tournament mix again, but inexperience and a lack of chemistry stemming from all their injuries will likely lead to Memphis struggling to get in. A lottery pick only aids Memphis in its collection of talent to build around Morant and Jackson, and the 2021 draft appears to be stacked. Let\u2019s not forget the Grizzlies are still in the process of a rebuild, and already have several players on the roster capable of serving as complementary pieces to Morant and Jackson in Brooks, Winslow, De\u2019Anthony Melton, Brandon Clarke, and Desmond Bane, not to mention the flexibility to make a solid addition during 2021 free agency. It\u2019s a luxury to be in the midst of a rebuild with the requisite talent on hand to legitimately compete for a berth in the postseason. That\u2019s where Memphis finds itself going into the second half of the season, and regardless of the outcome over the final 40 games, the future remains bright. \u2014 Michael C.

Devin Booker, who had averaged one coach per year of his career and never sniffed the playoffs, must be dizzy in a positive way right now. The Suns are actually good and managing to sustain quality basketball. Once again, it\u2019s Chris Paul as a difference-maker. Much as he did last season in Oklahoma City, Paul is again taking a young team further than it imagined. Paul\u2019s presence has not only had an effect on Booker, but more importantly former No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton, who is averaging averaging a double-double and shooting a career-best 60.1%. His confidence is up and the big man feels important to the mix. Biggest question going into the second half: Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are showing growth here in their young careers. They will be crucial to the Suns\u2019 ability to diversify its offense and add more second-half flex. Can those two swingmen keep their foot on the developmental gas pedal and be even better over the next few month? Bridges especially has been solid as a 3-point shooter (42.3%). One of the most underrated pickups in the offseason was Jae Crowder, who left a championship-quality Miami team (financial security played a part). Additionally, center Frank Kaminsky has been revived in Phoenix and developed into a reliable 3-point shooter (41.9%). Those two help make the Suns a respectable if not dangerous perimeter club. Remember when there were questions in the past about Paul\u2019s durability? Well, he\u2019s answered positively about that, avoiding injuries and giving 32 minutes a night. The Suns will keep their fingers crossed that the veteran\u2019s body continues to treat him right. If it doesn\u2019t, Phoenix lacks anyone on the roster who can impact the game from the point like he can. Playoffs or lottery?: It appears the Suns\u2019 lost decade is a nightmare of the past, as they finally are making a believable run toward the playoffs and, perhaps, home-court advantage in the first round. This would be a major step under coach Monty Williams and a continuation of what we saw from the Suns in the bubble, when they went undefeated and narrowly missed out on the playoffs. Booker was so sensational during that run, when every restart game was essentially a playoff game for Phoenix. It would therefore be a spectacle to behold if the Suns finally return to the playoffs and Booker gets a chance to shine in prime time. That said, this is a largely inexperienced team from a postseason standpoint. The best advice is rather simple: Continue to take cues from Paul and learn valuable lessons along the way. The Suns can stand to be a bit better in all areas, and if there is reasonable improvement across the aboard, they can get beyond the first round. That alone would be cause for celebration, no matter if their playoff stay ends there. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":506467,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-utah-jazz","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Utah Jazz","content":"First half summary: You expected an improved Utah Jazz team coming into the season, but who knew they\u2019d head into All-Star break with the league\u2019s best record? Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said the team is on a mission and we can all tell. Stifling defense has been the team\u2019s hallmark with the Jazz consistently running opponents off the 3-point line towards Rudy Gobert, who dominates in the paint as a rim protector. Gobert came into March ranked second in rebounds (13.1) and second in blocks (2.7), and he was tied for No. 2 in the league in double-doubles (24). Offensively, Utah came into March with the third-highest offensive rating (117.0) and third-best 3-point percentage (39.8), as seven of the nine players comprising the regular rotation were knocking down 37% or better from long range. They can beat you in a variety of ways, which makes the Jazz incredibly difficult to defend. They\u2019re an elite 3-point shooting team that can also consistently put pressure on the rim. Their trio of All-Star caliber players in Mitchell, Gobert and Mike Conley \u2014 who was again snubbed for an All-Star appearance \u2014 possesses plenty of experience. Mitchell and Royce O\u2019Neale are the most inexperienced players among the starters, and they\u2019re both playing in their fourth season. Then there\u2019s Utah\u2019s bench, which is led by Jordan Clarkson (17.9 ppg, 37% from deep). There aren\u2019t many weaknesses on this team. But if we\u2019re nitpicking, the Jazz could use another perimeter defender. Biggest question going into the second half: Can the Jazz hold it together in the playoffs, where they haven\u2019t reached the West finals since 2007? Mitchell and Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray blessed NBA fans with an epic duel in the first round last season, but Utah surrendered a 3-1 lead series to the Nuggets for an early exit. Obviously, that disappointing experience burns in the psyche of the players, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re using it as motivation to blow through the field in the regular season. The desire is there. The chemistry is there. So, now it\u2019s a matter of sharpening everything and staying healthy for the postseason run. Playoffs or lottery?: Arguably the most complete team in the West, the Jazz are headed to the postseason likely as the No. 1 seed if they can stay healthy. At the start of the season, most pundits predicted the Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers to be the last team standing in the West. But the first half of the season indicates otherwise, with the Jazz poised to make plenty of noise in the West. Over a long season of attrition, the Jazz expectedly showed signs of exhaustion playing in the second game of a back-to-back on Feb. 27 against the Orlando Magic. With the NBA looking to squeeze in the second half of the season in a compressed window, their 124-109 win could prove to be valuable training for what the Jazz and the rest of the league will inevitably encounter coming out of the All-Star break. \u201cWe know some games you don\u2019t really have the legs,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cIn those games, we have to make sure we have our heads.\u201d \u2014 Michael C.

And sure enough, they\u2019ve fit that description by failing to show the muscle necessary to be a top-five team, yet also riding the supreme performance of Stephen Curry to avoid a free-fall. Curry has been that good. After missing virtually all last season, he\u2019s challenging for the NBA scoring lead and generating some Kia MVP buzz. Still, there are sketchy signals elsewhere. Kelly Oubre Jr. plunged into a terrible shooting slump to open 2020-21 and didn\u2019t emerge until after the holidays. Draymond Green is being exposed as a supreme role player now that he\u2019s not surrounded by Hall of Famers who covered for his flaws. And the rest of the rotation is tapped out for the most part in terms of talent. Biggest question going into the second half: Will rookie center James Wiseman take an upward step in his development \u2026 or will that happen next season? The Warriors are certainly pleased with the No. 2 overall pick, who has looked comfortable in decent stretches and brings a defensive touch at the rim. Still, this is by far the longest he\u2019s ever played basketball, and in these situations, players can hit the wall. Wiseman is needed because the Warriors are thin on the front line, aside from Green and Eric Paschall. Andrew Wiggins has been decent \u2014 not great or certainly not anywhere near the uninspired example he set all those seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. But, this is probably who he is at this point. Playoffs or lottery?: It\u2019s hard to imagine Curry missing out on the playoffs with the season he\u2019s having. That said, this was always the only question about Curry: Is he good enough to carry a so-so team to the postseason? Russell Westbrook did so in OKC when Kevin Durant bounced. It\u2019s not easy to do, especially in the loaded West. While the Warriors are a top-five offensive team, Curry will eventually need someone to pick up the scoring slack. Oubre and Wiggins do have the talent for that. Now we\u2019ll see if they have the mentality, especially once the games grow in importance. Missing the playoffs in back-to-back seasons would be ego-deflating for this once-mighty franchise as it waits for the return of Thompson. Should the Warriors make the playoffs, they could be a tough out \u2014 mainly because of Curry. He\u2019d be reenergized in that situation, no doubt, and would get a hefty share of the shots, even more than he\u2019s getting now. Here\u2019s a scenario: The Warriors lose in the first round, but Curry averages 40 points. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":504866,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-dallas-mavericks","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Dallas Mavericks","content":"First half summary: Triple-double machine Luka Doncic celebrated his 22 nd birthday on Feb. 28 at the peak of Dallas\u2019 long fight back into postseason contention, as the team finally returned to .500 the night before the youngster\u2019s birthday with an impressive 115-98 win against the surging Brooklyn Nets. The victory served as a reminder of just how far Dallas had come after it dropped nine of 11 games from Jan. 15 to Feb. 1, in part, due to the league\u2019s health and safety protocols stopping the team in its tracks. Dallas rebounded from those setbacks, and a pair of postponements brought on by an unprecedented winter storm in February to win eight of its 12 games that month, as Doncic gradually rounds back into Kia MVP form. Doncic averaged 23.8 ppg in December, 28.3 ppg in January and 30.3 ppg in February, despite missing Kristaps Porzingis for the last three games of the month. The Mavs struggled out of the gates due to multiple players \u2014 including three starters in Dorian Finney-Smith, Josh Richardson and Maxi Kleber \u2014 missing extended time in the league\u2019s COVID-19 protocols, along with talented backup point guard Jalen Brunson. The combination of those players finally catching a rhythm after missing so much time, and Doncic\u2019s continued development appear to be key in Dallas trending in the positive direction it\u2019s headed. But it\u2019s worth noting the Mavericks entered the month of March with a record of 11-10 against teams at or above .500 this season and 4-6 against teams below .500. You can\u2019t make the postseason if you\u2019re not defeating the teams you\u2019re supposed to beat. Biggest question going into the second half: What happens with Porzingis moving forward? A right knee surgery from an injury suffered in the NBA bubble during the playoffs kept Porzingis out of the first nine games of the season. Then, Dallas held Porzingis out three games due to lower back stiffness. In the midst of the latest injury setback, Porzingis also became the subject of trade rumors . Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and coach Rick Carlisle have denied the team is interested in trading Porzingis, and the 25-year old recently said , \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, and I shouldn\u2019t be worried about it. It can only distract me at the end of the day.\u201d He\u2019s certainly correct, but it\u2019s worth pondering how the trade rumors might affect Porzingis\u2019 performance on the court as the season progresses. That\u2019s not even taking into account the concerns about Porzingis\u2019 recent run of bad luck with injuries. The Mavericks are 8-9 this season with Porzingis in the lineup and 7-7 without him on the floor. Playoffs or lottery?: If Dallas keeps up its current momentum, this team is headed back to the playoffs as the seventh or eighth seed in the West. Don\u2019t sleep on the Mavericks, though. They\u2019ll have a legitimate shot to advance past the opening round, and perhaps beyond as the team continues to build the chemistry it has missed through the early part of the season. Dallas entered March having won seven of its last 10 games, and Doncic is on an absolute tear. He averaged 31.1 ppg over his last 10 games going into March on 50.5% from the floor and 45.8% from deep to go with 7.2 rpg and 7.7 apg. During that stretch, Doncic also produced the three best regular-season scoring performances of his career with 46, 44 and 42 points. Doncic just needs more help from the supporting cast, starting with Porzingis (provided he remains with the Mavericks for the duration), as well as Richardson and Finney-Smith. Backups Tim Hardaway Jr. and Brunson need to come through, too. One issue to keep an eye on during the second half is how well the Mavericks close out games. They struggled last season down the stretch in games, and we\u2019ve seen some of that creep in throughout the first half of 2020-21. \u2014 Michael C.

Speaking of consistency, LeBron James once again seems indestructible in his 17th season, avoiding injury and performing at a Kia MVP-type level. His shooting range has never been better, and once again he\u2019s the team\u2019s best facilitator. Newcomers Dennis Schroder and Montrezl Harrell found useful roles and are better than the players they replaced from a season ago. The only cloudy issue is Anthony Davis\u2019 durability. He suffered a calf injury that benched him for nearly three weeks, a time period that perhaps was precautionary as well, and the Lakers cooled off in his absence. Prior to the injury, Davis\u2019 play wasn\u2019t as steep as last season, but he\u2019s graded on a higher scale than most. And, anyway, the Lakers didn\u2019t appear to lose any sleep over it. Biggest question going into the second half: Assuming Davis recovers from his calf injury and remains dormant, the Lakers must continue to get reasonably decent perimeter production. Among the Lakers with 150 3-point attempts or more, only James, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope are shooting better than 35%. Interestingly, Kuzma\u2019s progress seems to have stalled a bit. Two seasons ago he was viewed at best as a possible third star on a good team. The reality now is he\u2019s a role player on a great team. He has embraced that reality and been a good soldier while giving the Lakers quality moments off the bench. Didn\u2019t the Lakers expect a bit more from Marc Gasol? His production waned last season in Toronto, yet apparently the Lakers saw fit to make him their starting center. He is clearly out of gas, averaging career lows in scoring and rebounding (4.8 ppg, 4.1 rpg), but his passing and interior defense are adequate. This is why rumors of adding DeMarcus Cousins have the sound of legitimacy. Playoffs or lottery?: Securing the top seed in the West is once again a believable goal for the Lakers, through not necessary a primary one. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no real home-court advantage with sparsely filled or empty arenas. Therefore, the Lakers (or any other contender) won\u2019t risk overwhelming their stars to obtain the best record. In the playoffs, the Lakers hope to get steady play from newcomers who lack substantial postseason experience. That means Schroder and Wesley Matthews in particular might be asked to deliver in tight moments, much like KCP and (surprisingly) Talen Horton-Tucker did last fall. Understandably, the blueprint for the Lakers is to make sure Davis is healthy and reduce LeBron\u2019s minutes whenever necessary. Doing so would squelch the team\u2019s few weaknesses as much as possible. If that happens, the Lakers will confidently enter the playoffs as the heavy, looking to push their considerable weight around. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":504688,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-la-clippers","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: LA Clippers","content":"First half summary: Humbled by a disastrous experience in the playoffs, the Clippers returned with a new coach and new outlook, and once again are looking very much like a title contender. Paul George, who was the face of that playoff experience, is healthy physically and mentally and shooting the ball at high efficiency (and is flirting with a 50-40-90 season). Likewise, Kawhi Leonard is at peak performance and the Clippers are getting quality deep shooting from Marcus Morris, who rates among the best in the league beyond the arc. The club is fifth in NBA team scoring. There are some nitpicking issues, though. Lou Williams began the season in a slump, yet broke free in February. Patrick Beverley missed scattered games with nagging injuries. But the Clippers were encouraged by Nicolas Batum, who arrived and compensated for much of those holes with quality minutes at small forward. In doing so, he\u2019s served the Clippers well and revived his career. Biggest question going into the second half: The Clippers were certainly hoping for more from Luke Kennard after acquiring him in the offseason and giving him a four-year, $64 million extension. Kennard was supposed to help with ball-handling and 3-point shooting, but his motor was suspiciously low. He\u2019s appeared timid and unwilling to step into a meaningful role by passing up too many shots. This has frustrated the coaching staff, which wanted Kennard to reduce the load on Leonard and George. Is Williams\u2019 slow start well behind him? He has been one of the league\u2019s premier sixth men for almost a decade now. He\u2019s also in the final year of his contract and this is the right time to make a statement and play for his next deal. There\u2019s word the Clippers were exploring a potential trade of Williams, perhaps for point guard help. Speaking of that, the Clippers could address the point guard position either in the buyout market or with a trade. Beverley and Reggie Jackson are giving mixed results, and at this stage of their careers, both are better suited as backups. Should the Clippers find someone better \u2014 Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry, perhaps, should the Raptors put him on the market \u2014 such a player could be a difference-maker come playoff time. Playoffs or lottery?: The Clippers are focusing their sights on the top seed in the West, which is obtainable provided their stars stay healthy and their veterans don\u2019t suddenly grow old in a hurry. Much will depend on Beverley\u2019s health, Williams\u2019 shooting touch, Batum\u2019s pace and Serge Ibaka\u2019s ability to defend at the rim. Everyone in the franchise is well aware of the past, and also how the regular season, in the big picture, doesn\u2019t mean much to a team with plenty to prove. Also, consider that this could be Leonard\u2019s walk year (he has a player option for 2021-22). A strong finish by the Clippers, coupled with a deeper playoff run, will be needed to secure his services beyond this season. This is yet another championship-or-bust season. Remember, the Clippers\u2019 Draft future belongs to OKC, and there isn\u2019t much young talent on the roster to be developed. This team is built to hoist the trophy, and if it doesn\u2019t, the hefty bill for failure will be due soon. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":505560,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-oklahoma-city-thunder","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Oklahoma City Thunder","content":"First half summary: Oklahoma City shocked the NBA last season with a surprise postseason berth from a gutted roster led by Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and general manager Sam Presti stripped down the team even further coming into this season. The Thunder entered the 2020 offseason already flush with plenty of future Draft assets, but Presti thought twice about building on last season, deciding instead to institute a rebuild with the dizzying slew of picks netted through the 2027 NBA Draft as a foundation. Along the way, the Thunder found a way to remain fairly competitive through the first half of the season with a new coach in Mark Daigneault and a collection of mainly no-name young talent, headlined by Gilgeous-Alexander and impressive youngster Lu Dort; the only two returning starters from last season. Before the season even started, Oklahoma City made its priorities known. Presti told The Oklahoman \u201cit was clear that the most objective path was to prioritize the future.\u201d OKC did that, and handed the keys to Gilgeous-Alexander, who is averaging career highs in scoring (23.2 points per game) and assists (6.3) entering the month of March, while Dort \u2014 known mostly as a defender last season as a rookie \u2014 is averaging career highs in scoring (12.5 ppg), rebounds (3.4) and assists (1.5) over the same span. Gilgeous-Alexander, 22, leads the league in drives to the rack, and is clearly one of the foundational pieces in the current rebuild. The current roster consists of 12 players age 26 or younger, including a pair of 19-year-olds in Theo Maledon and Aleksei Pokusevski, two 20-year-olds in Darius Bazley and Josh Hall, as well as 21-year-olds Dort and Moses Brown. Biggest question going into the second half: What future Draft compensation can Presti land headed toward the trade deadline? Because at this point, we know two things: 1) The Thunder aren\u2019t seriously looking to make a run at the postseason, and 2) they\u2019ll likely be sellers leading up to the March 25 trade deadline. There\u2019s a good chance Presti will look to move veterans such as Al Horford, George Hill, Mike Muscala and Trevor Ariza to build upon the team\u2019s already large collection of assets. Ariza might be more of a buyout candidate, but Horford and Hill could be valuable to some of the league\u2019s contenders looking for vets. Horford has two years remaining on his deal. Rookie Maledon has already replaced Hill in the starting lineup for several games, after the veteran guard suffered a thumb injury that should keep him out past the All-Star break. Muscala, meanwhile, could be attractive because of his ability to stretch the floor and his $2.3 million contract. Playoffs or lottery?: The Thunder advanced to the playoffs in 10 of the last 11 seasons, but we knew before the season even started they would be headed to the lottery with plenty of ammunition from past transactions to rebuild the team in a variety of ways. Still, the Thunder are within reasonable striking distance for a spot in the Play-In Tournament. Then again, if you go back to last season, many thought OKC would make moves ahead of the deadline. Instead, the Thunder stood pat, surprising everyone by advancing to the postseason and taking a high-powered Houston Rockets team to seven games. Might Presti conduct himself similarly this year? That\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess at this point. But the moves Presti made going all the way back to the Paul George and Russell Westbrook trades have put OKC squarely in position to quickly return to title contention if the GM shrewdly navigates the team\u2019s extensive bevy of assets. History indicates Presti is capable. \u2014 Michael C.

Much of this had to do with the game-savior role assumed once again by Damian Lillard, who rescued the club with a handful of game-changing late jumpers. The Blazers endured CJ McCollum\u2019s small foot fracture which sidelined him for a month, along with injuries to Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins (out indefinitely). Lillard (29.8 ppg, 8.0 apg) is challenging for the NBA scoring title in what looks like another All-NBA season. Enes Kanter is another bright spot \u2014 and a mildly surprising one at that. He was an economical offseason addition and is serving his second tour of duty in Portland, providing a soft touch around the basket and strong rebounding (11.5 rpg in 26.2 mpg) to make him a valued contributor. Biggest question going into the second half: Assuming McCollum recovers nicely, the Blazers should have the necessary rotational players to make noise and perhaps push for a top-four seed in the West. Lots will depend on the efforts of a few newcomers, namely Derrick Jones Jr. and Robert Covington. These athletic swingmen are valued for their defense, a major issue with Portland last season which hasn\u2019t completely vanished (the Blazers are 28th in Defensive Rating). Gary Trent Jr. was a revelation last season for the Blazers, especially in the playoffs. He replaced McCollum in the lineup after his injury and, while he had his moments \u2014 especially with deep shooting (41%) \u2014 Trent is perhaps better suited as a sixth man. Nurkic must also bounce back from a fractured wrist and give the Blazers the level of quality post-play that they expect from him, and will need in order to make a bigger statement in the West. It would also be nice if Rodney Hood or maybe Carmelo Anthony could relieve some of the load from Portland\u2019s volume shooters. Playoffs or lottery?: The Blazers are clearly a top-six team in the West and should reach the playoffs securely if not comfortably. But will they be completely healthy? That\u2019s always been an issue with Portland, especially in the recent past. As solid as Lillard and McCollum are, they still haven\u2019t reached the promised land and only once appeared in the West finals. Therefore, it\u2019ll require the maximum possible from all the important pieces in the rotation to exceed expectations for Portland \u2014 meaning, a Finals trip. Another major factor will be defense, which has held the Blazers back in the past. Can Portland stop the opposing team\u2019s best player(s) in crucial moments? Although he\u2019s certainly capable of supplying the goods, it\u2019s probably too much to ask Lillard to bail you out every time. At some point, Portland will need an additional hero, either defensively, on the glass or simply by making big plays. Every neutral basketball fan would love to see Lillard enjoy a deep run into the postseason. He\u2019s a true professional, loyal to the organization, big in the community and as we saw last fall, capable of delivering in the postseason. Yet Portland will need to play high-level basketball and get a few breaks to make it out of the West. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":505551,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-new-orleans-pelicans","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: New Orleans Pelicans","content":"First half summary: Inconsistency highlights the first half story for this young, talented team still trying to find its way in the ultracompetitive Western Conference. One night, you see the Pelicans slaying the league\u2019s giants ; dominating the NBA\u2019s best rim-protecting squads such as Utah by erupting for 74 points in the paint. They\u2019ll best expected playoff teams like Phoenix, Milwaukee and Boston \u2026 only to fall flat against the last-place Detroit Pistons and Minnesota Timberwolves. It\u2019s baffling and frustrating for the young squad, and its new coach Stan Van Gundy. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re almost there,\u201d second-year star Zion Williamson said on Feb. 27, after a 117-114 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. \u201cThere\u2019s that final few things we need to figure out, but we\u2019re almost there.\u201d Losing nine of 13 games in January dropped New Orleans into a hole, only for it to deepen when the Pelicans lost seven of 10 from Feb. 10-27. Defending the 3-pointer has been one of New Orleans\u2019 most glaring issues all season, but the Pelicans improved recently in that area by making some tweaks to pick-and-roll coverage . Will it hold? New Orleans remains optimistic. The Pelicans ranked sixth in offensive rating (115.8) through their first 34 games. So, there\u2019s no question they can score. But being No. 28 in defensive rating (116.1) over the same span has to be frustrating for a defensive-minded coach like Van Gundy. Biggest question going into the second half: Will New Orleans achieve a modicum of consistency? It\u2019s a fair question to ponder based off what we\u2019ve seen so far. The young Pelicans are one of the league\u2019s most talented and exciting teams, but from night to night you never know which team will show up to the arena. Gifted scorers Williamson and Brandon Ingram combine to average nearly 50 points per game. Williamson and Steven Adams provide a physical edge in the paint. Four of the team\u2019s starters average double figures in scoring, but New Orleans needs to figure out ways to consistently put together stops on defense. Van Gundy\u2019s track record suggests the Pelicans will be able to fix their defensive woes to transform into one of the NBA\u2019s better teams in that area; or at least middle-of-the-pack. Van Gundy\u2019s teams ranked in the top 10 in defensive rating in nine of his 12 years as a coach in Miami (2003-06), Orlando (2002-12) and Detroit (2014-18), prior to arrival to The Big Easy. Van Gundy has said on multiple occasions that New Orleans possesses enough talent to defeat anybody in the NBA, but he also adds his team makes too many mistakes and lacks consistency on defense. Playoffs or lottery?: As the Pelicans work through issues with inconsistency, most of the teams above them in the standings (perhaps with the exception of Memphis) have already found solid footing. New Orleans figures to compete for a berth in the play-in tournament; especially when you factor in all the potential hurdles ahead in the second half of the season awaiting every team in the West. The concern is whether New Orleans can gain enough ground on the rest of the field. The Pelicans will improve in the second half \u2014 it\u2019s almost guaranteed. They\u2019re young, hungry and gaining more confidence with every victory against quality opponents. It\u2019s clear New Orleans is committed to returning to the playoffs as soon as possible. But it appears the first postseason berth since 2017-18 will have to wait. New Orleans is likely headed back to the lottery, where it will have another shot at adding to an already immensely talented pool of players. Remember, the Pelicans have already stockpiled plenty of assets from the trades of Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. That should give New Orleans plenty of ammo to build around young stars Williamson and Ingram. \u2014 Michael C.

Well, none of the newcomers (Bogdan Bogdanovic, Rajon Rondo, Kris Dunn or Danilo Gallinari) have made a major difference so far because of injuries and sub-par play. That has the Hawks scuffling for respectability as a 4-1 start was followed by a February swoon that saw them lose seven of eight \u2014 mainly by blowing fourth-quarter leads. That was enough to get Lloyd Pierce fired as coach March 1. Once again they\u2019ve relied heavily on the young holdovers, mainly Trae Young and John Collins, with some interior support from Clint Capela, to stay in the shadows of the East\u2019s top eight. Their defense, once a sore subject, is improved a bit. And the Hawks do bring a fair amount of 3-point shooters to the mix. Biggest question going into the second half: Will the Hawks become whole? Their depth, which was clearly a team strength when the season began, took a hit with multiple injuries. In essence, Atlanta has never really seen the real Hawks, given the lineup and rotational changes. Of all the injuries they\u2019ve endured, Atlanta could really use a comeback by De\u2019Andre Hunter. He\u2019s the Hawks\u2019 only decent wing defender and has out since January with a bum knee. The Hawks also need to see better efficiency from Cam Reddish. Remember, he was part of the two-player package that came in the Draft-day trade of Luka Doncic. While Young has, for the most part, pulled his end of the deal, Reddish remains an enigma. He\u2019s shooting 36.5% overall and 26.2% on 3-pointers \u2014 not what you want from the swing position or from a player getting decent minutes. Playoffs or lottery?: The Hawks will more likely make the playoffs than miss them. That\u2019s because their young players should improve and grow (as they did in the second half of last season) and the injuries will heal, and also remember that Collins is playing for money. Basically, there is upside here, and those factors are in Atlanta\u2019s favor. But it\u2019s not a cinch by any means. Their margin for error is slim, and any lengthy losing streak could spell doom for the Hawks\u2019 chances. They\u2019re currently fighting for a spot in the Play-In. Even in the best-case scenario, the Hawks\u2019 ceiling in the East is probably a No. 7 finish. After all the offseason add-ons, this would be somewhat of a disappointment, especially if the trend of fourth-quarter collapses continues. If the Hawks miss the playoffs, it would mean their plan has hit a speed bump. This is about the time when Young, Collins and others could use playoff seasoning, and it would allow the front office to add another page to their evaluations of these players, to see how they perform under pressure. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":504786,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-new-york-knicks","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: New York Knicks","content":"First half summary: Usually when the Knicks train pulls into the midseason station, the wheels are ready to fall off. Not so this time. Yes, New Yorkers, there\u2019s hope. The Knicks have risen to be \u2026 middle-of-the-packers, and this qualifies as improvement. First-year coach Tom Thibodeau put a system in place to maximize the mostly thin talent on hand and is getting better-than-expected results. Another sign of progress is the Knicks have an All-Star, their first since Carmelo Anthony. Julius Randle began the year as potential trade bait, then made himself a keeper with strong play near the rim and vastly improved shooting from behind the arc. Remember a season ago when the Knicks had a stable of power forwards? Well, they did something right for a change \u2014 they kept the right one. Biggest question going into the second half: The Knicks need to prove that the first half wasn\u2019t a mirage. They\u2019ve spent the first few months either at or near the bottom in points per game. They need to find a consistent secondary option to Randle, which means RJ Barrett, the most likely candidate for that role, must improve his shooting (43.5% overall and 34.5% on 3-pointers). And they must continue to display an appetite for hard work and defense, which of course are trademarks of a Thibodeau-coached team. They\u2019re still unsettled at point guard \u2014 Randle actually leads the club in assists \u2014 and this is probably an issue that won\u2019t be resolved this season. Derrick Rose arrived to lend a hand, while Elfrid Payton and rookie Immanuel Quickley had stretches where they performed well. Quickley is clearly the future and New York gushes over him whenever he delivers a solid performance but, as a rookie, he\u2019s dealing with inconsistency right now. Finally, the Knicks hope to welcome back Mitchell Robinson soon from a broken hand. The club placed a reasonable investment in Robinson, hoping for positive results as he navigates through the player development program. While Robinson is clearly an athletic big, his skill-set remains stagnant for the most part. His footwork and offensive moves are still under construction while he makes do with defense and rebounding. Playoffs or lottery?: There\u2019s a lot of company near the last two playoff spots in the East, with the Knicks staring at the Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Orlando Magic and maybe the Miami Heat. As much as the Knicks are putting forth the right energy and giving off lots of encouraging vibes, they\u2019re probably headed for the lottery again. This wouldn\u2019t be a terrible place nor would it signify a step backward. If anything, the Knicks appear to be in good hands under new management and with Thibodeau on the bench. Put it this way: It\u2019s been a while before those words were typed or believed by the masses. Ultimately, the Knicks require an infusion of talent \u2014 in that sense, nothing has changed at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks need to fortify their rotation with more players like Quickley and Barrett, while finding a few more Randles. That\u2019s when the city will suspect there\u2019s playoff basketball ahead. Until then, New York will attach itself to the Brooklyn Nets, as much as Knicks fans will take issue with that. \u2014 Shaun Powell"},{"id":506326,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-charlotte-hornets","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Charlotte Hornets","content":"First half summary: With two big additions in the offseason, the Charlotte Hornets have taken a significant step forward. Gordon Hayward (averaging an efficient 21.5 ppg) is back to being a go-to guy offensively and LaMelo Ball (one of eight players averaging at least 15 points, six rebounds and six assists) is the clear favorite to win Kia Rookie of the Year. With the additional talent and some improvement from their young core, the Hornets have been the league\u2019s fourth-most improved team statistically, 6.5 points per 100 possessions better than they were last season. The bigger improvement has come on offense, where the Hornets are in the middle of the pack after ranking 28th last season. With Hayward, Terry Rozier and Malik Monk all having shot better than 40% from beyond the arc, the team ranks sixth in 3-point percentage (38.5%). With the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, the Hornets have shot 23-for-45 (51%) from beyond the arc. Their 11-5 record in clutch games has them in a fight for the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference at 17-18 heading into the break. Biggest questions going into the second half: Can they be better defensively? Though they have plenty of speed and athleticism in their rotation, the Hornets rank 19th defensively. Their opponents have taken 79% of their shots, the league\u2019s highest opponent rate, from the restricted area or 3-point range. They\u2019ve allowed a league-high 5.3 corner 3-pointers per game, with the two highest totals in any game this season \u2014 Utah\u2019s 15 corner 3s on Feb. 22 and Memphis\u2019 12 on Feb. 10 \u2014 having come against the Charlotte defense. The Hornets have had some success in playing the most zone defense in the league, but can be beat pretty easily by teams willing to move the ball. Who\u2019s coming off the bench? The Hornets have four players \u2014 Rozier, Hayward, Devonte\u2019 Graham and PJ Washington \u2014 who\u2019ve started every game they\u2019ve played in. And with at least one of those four guys having missed each of their last 15 games, Ball has started all 15. So, when everybody\u2019s healthy, a decision will have to be made, and maybe it\u2019s to start all four of those guys and the rookie, with Cody Zeller (who\u2019s started his last 14 games) coming off the bench. The Hornets have outscored their opponents by 21 points per 100 possessions in 102 minutes with Ball, Graham and Rozier on the floor together and by 4.5 points per 100 possessions in 445 minutes with Washington at center. Playoffs or lottery?: Ball is 19 years old, and the Hornets have three other rotation guys \u2014 Miles Bridges, Monk and Washington \u2014 who are 23 or younger, while Graham and Rozier are each just 26. So the long-term play is the right one. But in the Eastern Conference, hanging around .500 puts you in the heart of the play-in race, and the Hornets should remain there if they stay healthy. That gives them a legit chance at ending a four-year playoff drought, though Charlotte will likely have to wait longer for its first playoff series win since 2002. When that time comes, we could look back at this season as the start of the turnaround. Even if the playoffs are another year away, the Hornets have taken a critical step toward contention. In addition to establishing a foundation on which to build, they\u2019ve been a lot of fun to watch from night to night. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":505565,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: San Antonio Spurs","content":"First half summary: The world saw the end of an era when San Antonio\u2019s record-tying run of 22 straight postseason berths ended after a spirited fight in the NBA bubble. But it appears the Spurs could be quickly reviving their tradition, thanks to a stylistic change that began during the team\u2019s time in Orlando. Nobody expected the Spurs to rebound so quickly. But here we are at the start of March with San Antonio sitting just a half game behind the fifth-place Portland Trail Blazers, despite starting the season missing key players Derrick White and Keldon Johnson due to injuries. San Antonio went 9-7 in January and finished February at 6-3 after a COVID-19 breakout sidelined the Spurs for nine days. The team\u2019s March 1 overtime loss to the Brooklyn Nets marked just the second game back since the hiatus, and the Spurs played without White, Johnson, Rudy Gay, Devin Vassell and Quinndary Weatherspoon, as all were unavailable due to the NBA\u2019s health and safety protocols. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich definitely deserves mention in the Coach of the Year conversation, considering how he successfully navigated the Spurs\u2019 drastic stylistic change, injuries, and a young roster, not to mention the challenges of drawing up competitive lineups in the face of players sidelined due to the pandemic. The first half of the season also saw a role change for seven-time NBA All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge missed nine games due to various injuries, and in the three games since he\u2019s returned, he\u2019s been coming off the bench. Popovich hasn\u2019t said whether the move is permanent, but it\u2019s definitely a major adjustment for a high-usage player that has averaged 34.2 minutes over his 15-year career. Biggest question going into the second half: Can San Antonio handle the intensity of the second-half schedule? The NBA shoehorned in five make-up games from the first half of the season that were postponed due to COVID-19 protocols, putting San Antonio into the position of facing a whopping 40 games over the last 68 days of the season. Like the Memphis Grizzlies, the Spurs also have to play a league-high 11 back-to-back sets in the second half of a schedule that doesn\u2019t provide for any more than just one day\u2019s rest. Headed into the March 2 matchup against the New York Knicks, the Spurs were the NBA\u2019s only winless team (0-4) in the second game of a back-to-back. Complicating matters is the fact that 23 of the Spurs\u2019 last 40 games will be on the road. Luckily San Antonio now fields a fairly young and deep roster. Ten of the team\u2019s players are 26 or younger, with underrated star DeMar DeRozan, Aldridge, Gay and Patty Mills representing the Spurs in their 30s. In the past, San Antonio stacked so many victories early in the season that it could afford to rest players as the postseason approached. That won\u2019t be the case for this incarnation of the Spurs, as they\u2019ll likely play crucial games all the way to the end. San Antonio\u2019s stamina will be tested from May 12-16 in closing the regular season with four games in five nights. Playoffs or lottery?: The extensive road schedule in the second half would normally be cause for concern, but San Antonio\u2019s road record is actually better than its record at home. The most pressing concern is whether the Spurs can deftly navigate the rigors from such a challenging schedule to close the season. That\u2019s where Popovich\u2019s leadership and basketball acumen come into play, along with the franchise\u2019s well-established track record for ensuring players receive plenty of time for proper rest and recovery. This won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s doable. So, San Antonio should ride back into the postseason after a one-year absence. They\u2019ll likely go in as a six or seven seed, but the Spurs are not quite ready to flex any staying power in the playoffs; especially against the higher seeded teams in the West. There\u2019s a possibility San Antonio might surprise everyone and take its first-round opponent to seven games. But the Spurs will likely endure a first-round exit. Still, that\u2019s major progress for a team nobody expected to be there in the first place. \u2014 Michael C.

Despite marked improvement from Jaylen Brown, the Celtics have taken big steps backward on both ends of the floor, and at one point, lost 14 of 21 games to fall to 15-17 on the season. Kemba Walker missed the first 11 games and struggled to find a rhythm as he worked his way back from a knee injury. Marcus Smart, meanwhile, missed the last 18 games with a calf strain. But more consistent production from Walker helped the Celtics win four straight before the All-Star break. There are three teams standing alone at the top of the Eastern Conference, but the Celtics are slightly ahead of a large scrum of teams that has, like them, been hovering around .500. Biggest question going into the second half: How good are they at their best? We have yet to see an in-rhythm Walker alongside a healthy Smart and the improved Brown. If Walker has found his offense and Smart\u2019s return gives the defense a boost, the Celtics can fulfill their potential. But at their peak, they still might not be better than the fourth best team in the East. Their first game out of the All-Star break is in Brooklyn, and their last game before the trade deadline is in Milwaukee. So the Celtics, should they be at full strength, will have a pair of timely measuring-stick matchups. And if they don\u2019t measure up, it will be fascinating to see if Danny Ainge, with a big trade exception burning a hole in his pocket, makes a move or stays patient. Playoffs or lottery?: Health permitting, the Celtics should remain in the top six in the East and make their seventh straight trip to the postseason. But their four-year streak of reaching the conference semifinals could be in jeopardy. If Brooklyn, Milwaukee and Philadelphia are the top three seeds, we could have a scenario where the two teams that reached the conference finals last year \u2014 Boston and Miami \u2014 face each other in the first round. The Celtics have a veteran core that can push them into the list of serious contenders. But a lack of depth is holding them back, especially if their top four perimeter players aren\u2019t healthy throughout the second half of the season. Gordon Hayward\u2019s departure is the biggest reason why they\u2019ve taken a step backward, but it also left them with a tool (that trade exception) to help them move forward again. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":506316,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-brooklyn-nets","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Brooklyn Nets","content":"First half summary: Just 13 games into the season, not satisfied with having two superstars, the Brooklyn Nets traded for a third, sacrificing depth and a bevy of future Draft picks to bring together the greatest trio of offensive talent that this league has ever seen. James Harden arrived and fit right in, averaging 25.5 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 59.7%), 8.7 rebounds and 11.4 assists in his 23 games with the Nets prior to the All-Star break. Though Kevin Durant has missed 18 (including 12 of the last 13) games, Brooklyn leads the league in offensive efficiency (118.2 points scored per 100 possessions), with the highest effective field goal percentage (58.8%) in NBA history. Defense has been a work in progress. A lack of effort and cohesion on that end of the floor was holding the Nets back as they lost 10 games to Atlanta, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, Memphis, Oklahoma City and Washington. On Dec. 10, they were a disappointing 14-12. But a loss in Detroit seemed to be a wake-up call and the Nets won 10 of their last 11 games before the break, beating the Warriors, Suns, Lakers and Clippers on a 5-0 West Coast trip. The defense was improved (to a certain degree) and they also cut down on turnovers. Biggest question going into the second half: How good can they be defensively? With how overpowering the Nets\u2019 offense is \u2014 in addition to Harden, Durant and Kyrie Irving, they also have the league\u2019s best high-volume 3-point shooter \u2014 they probably don\u2019t need have a top-10 defense. But they will need to be better than they are right now (26th in defensive efficiency, 18th over their 10-1 stretch to close the first half). They\u2019ve settled on a switch-everything scheme, which is less taxing on their stars and can flatten out opposing offenses. But it requires great communication and concentration from everybody on the floor. The Nets have another 35 games to get sharper on that side of the ball and just how much they can reduce mistakes in their switching could be the thing to watch over the next 10 weeks. Playoffs or lottery?: The Nets are in a three-team battle for the top seed in the Eastern Conference, with three games remaining (all on the road) against the Milwaukee Bucks (2) and Philadelphia 76ers. Given the top-flight talent on the roster and the level that this team has played at in already beating every other elite team in the league, the goal is a championship. Seven weeks into the Brooklyn Big Three era, there have been no issues in regard to sharing the ball or the spotlight. And while Durant was dealing with a hamstring issue before the break, he seems fully recovered from the Achilles tear that kept him out last season. Irving and Durant have rings, but Harden has not reached The Finals since 2012 and Steve Nash has yet to coach a playoff game. There will be tests along the way, and both the Bucks and Sixers are serious threats. But it\u2019s fair to believe that the Nets will only get better, with Harden, Irving and Durant having played just 186 total minutes together. They have lineup versatility and could be a top destination for players who are bought out after the trade deadline. No matter what, they\u2019ll remain the most fascinating team in the league. \u2014 John Schuhmann"},{"id":507162,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-detroit-pistons","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Detroit Pistons","content":"First half summary:  For a team sputtering along with the NBA\u2019s second-worst record \u2014 10-26, just three games better than Minnesota \u2014 there are a lot of things going well for the Pistons. They rank 19 th in defensive efficiency and are 24 th offensively. They\u2019re outscoring their opponents from both the 3-point line and the foul line on a regular basis. They should, by the numbers, be more of a middle-of-the-pack team. And they play much harder than their record would indicate. But that\u2019s what you get in a rebuild and that\u2019s what you get with kids. Detroit is happy with its kiddie corps of Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Killian Hayes and Saben Lee, and the jobs done by GM Troy Weaver and coach Dwane Casey in developing and deploying them. With some very helpful veterans such as Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Delon Wright and Wayne Ellington (depending on what happens at the trade deadline), the Pistons are a solid NBA League Pass team to watch. Biggest question going into the second half: Blake Griffin\u2019s unsettled situation has reached a conclusion with his buyout , which will make him an unrestricted free agent. Now the biggest question for the Pistons is, what\u2019s up with the point guard spot? Lottery pick Killian Hayes was flipped the keys to start but hasn\u2019t played since his seventh game, suffering a labral tear in his hip. Weaver and staff reportedly still envision Hayes running that position, but whenever he returns the lanky 19-year-old will essentially start his rookie season over again. Wright, Lee and a refurbished Dennis Smith Jr. have all made arguments on the court for either starter or backup minutes, making 2021-22 wide open unless Hayes makes a considerable leap. Playoffs or lottery?: Lottery. Assuming the Pistons can keep this formula going \u2014 playing hard, getting young guys reps and still losing enough games to be in line for a Top 3 lottery finish \u2014 they stand to choose from the next batch of acclaimed top prospects. Could another lottery pick make Detroit\u2019s roster next season too young? Arguably. But Weaver only is getting started as the team\u2019s impresario, and Casey does a great job in giving the 22-and-under crew only as much responsibility as they can handle. What we\u2019ve seen in the first half hasn\u2019t been demoralizing, either to the players or the fans, and there\u2019s a great chance that will not change. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":507175,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-midseason-report-indiana-pacers","date":"2021-03-05","title":"2021 Midseason report: Indiana Pacers","content":"First half summary: Just over a month ago, the Pacers were 12-9, weathering their injury storm pretty well. Then they dropped 10 of their final 14 games in the season\u2019s first half, with losing streaks of four and five games that shook them in the East standings and challenged some psyches in the locker room. Having to play without two starters \u2014 T.J. Warren and Caris LeVert \u2014 for as long as Indiana has would rattle all but the deepest teams. Those two have logged a total of 117 minutes \u2014 all Warren\u2019s before he underwent left foot surgery four games into the season. LeVert, acquired from Brooklyn in the James Harden\/Victor Oladipo blockbuster trade in January, needed surgery to remove a cancerous mass on his left kidney found during his physical. There\u2019s no timetable for his return. The above didn\u2019t turn Indiana\u2019s first half into a washout. Domantas Sabonis made it to his second consecutive All-Star berth as a focal point of the Pacers\u2019 attack. Center Myles Turner leads the league in blocked shots, is a Kia Defensive Player of the Year candidate and is meshing up front better than ever with Sabonis. Backup T.J. McConnell\u2019s surprise triple-double before the break was a reminder that he and Malcolm Brogdon make a nifty point guard tandem. And new coach Nate Bjorkgren appears to have impressed both his players and his bosses with his calm demeanor and his willingness to innovate, a Nick Nurse-like trait from his Toronto background. Biggest questions going into the second half: When and how will Warren and LeVert be playing again, and will that fix the Pacers\u2019 scoring woes? That seems to be several questions to unpack but they\u2019re all connected. Indiana ranks 18 th in offensive rating overall (110.9) but is 22 nd (110.2) with since Jan. 13, when it shipped out Oladipo and took in LeVert, who has yet to play for them. That little fraction of a point can get you beat if it\u2019s part of a minus-2.2 difference in net rating, taking the Pacers from slightly in the black to clearly in the red. If Indiana can wait for Warren \u2014 especially the Orlando bubble Warren who was one of the restart\u2019s breakout performers \u2014 and LeVert and get them into any sort of rhythm before the postseason, it becomes an interesting and dangerous team in the East bracket. If rehab and rust linger, then not so much. Playoffs or lottery?: Playoffs. But without any sense of what that means until the questions above are answered. No one is questioning Bjorkgren or the players who have been available, but a team bumping along at or near .500 feels a little too Pacersesque. Think about it: Nate McMillan, their former coach, already is back in charge of an NBA team as Lloyd Pierce\u2019s interim replacement in Atlanta. A first-round appearance and exit \u2014 the very things (five years in a row) that got McMillan fired after last season \u2014 appears to be the likely outcome of 2020-21 for the Pacers. It\u2019s one of the league\u2019s uncomfortable middle seats, too good to dive for help into the lottery, not good enough to seriously contend. But there\u2019s always next season, right? \u2014 Steve Aschburner"}]
