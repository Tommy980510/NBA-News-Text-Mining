Though he believed he could have fought and scrapped his way onto an NBA roster via the free-agent route, Schofield came back to Knoxville with one goal in mind. \u201cI wanted to become one of coach [Rick] Barnes\u2019 favorite all-time players,\u201d Schofield says. Schofield had already been trending in that direction. Barnes loves gym rats, and Schofield is such a dedicated workout warrior even the demanding Barnes worries that the 6-foot-6, 241-pounder could wear himself down physically, or burn himself out mentally. So far, Schofield is still of sound mind and body (one NBA scout told 247Sports last spring he resembled a \u201cGreek god.\u201d) And all the work Schofield has put in \u2014 transforming himself from a chubby freshman who had trouble getting on the floor to a chiseled senior who\u2019s challenging for All-American honors and has been climbing up NBA Draft boards \u2014 coalesced in one shot for the ages. On Dec. 9, the Vols and then No. 1-ranked Gonzaga were locked in an epic struggle at the Phoenix Suns\u2019 Talking Stick Arena. With 29.5 seconds left, the score was tied 73-73 and Tennessee had possession. During a timeout, various options were being considered for Schofield to get the last shot, because junior forward Grant Williams, the Vols\u2019 best player and 2017-18 Southeastern Conference player of the year, had fouled out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got situations we want to put Grant and Admiral in,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s around the rim.\u201d Barnes\u2019 assistants wanted to post Schofield. \u201cBut I said \u2018no, they can find him too easy down there,\u2019 \u201d Barnes says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run a high ball screen.\u201d After the ball was inbounded to point guard Jordan Bone, Schofield set a screen on Gonzaga\u2019s Josh Perkins at the top of the key and then slipped out past the NBA 3-point line. Gonzaga\u2019s Rui Hachimura, who was guarding Schofield, sprinted along with Perkins toward Bone, who stopped close to the free-throw line and whipped a pass to Schofield. With Hachimura desperately lunging to close out, Schofield rose and tossed in a 3-pointer. Tennessee won 76-73. Schofield contributed 30 points and six 3s to the cause. \u201cI wanted to step out to the NBA 3 line to give myself more space,\u201d Schofield says. \u201cWhen [Hachimura followed Bone] my eyes lit up. It gave me so much space. I was waiting for the ball, and when it came, I just took the shot in rhythm.\u201d In his postgame talk to his team, quickly singled out Schofield. \u201cAD, when that shot went in, I promise you, I put my head down and all I could imagine was all the time you were in the gym,\u201d Barnes said. Those last few words were hard for Barnes to get out; the usually stern, stoic coach was overcome with emotion. Barnes raised his arms and motioned Schofield over for a hug, then continued his praise as players and staff applauded. \u201cI thought about how hard he\u2019s worked in four years,\u201d Barnes said, \u201cand for him to do it \u2026 I knew it was going in. I really did. I just knew it was going in.\u201d Suffice it to say Schofield was taken aback. \u201cThat was a first,\u201d Schofield says of Barnes\u2019 display of emotion. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that to come out. When he first started talking, I didn\u2019t think he was talking about me, and then he said AD, and I was like \u2018wow.\u2019 Coach Barnes, to his credit, has a different coaching style. He\u2019s a very hardnosed coach. He doesn\u2019t give many compliments, and even his compliments kind of sound like criticisms. When you get those compliments, it\u2019s kind of like a shocker. \u201cAt that moment, it kind of made me emotional too, because I felt like I was one step closer to achieving one of my goals to be one of the best players he\u2019s ever coached, and also one of his favorite players he\u2019s ever coached.\u201d After that shot against Gonzaga, the deal was done, which means Schofield is in some fast company along with Royale Ivey, P.J. Tucker, T.J. Ford and Kevin Durant, all of whom Barnes coached at Texas and went on to play in the NBA. \u201cI\u2019ve been hard on him,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him grow up. I\u2019ve watched him continue to grow. I have a great appreciation for guys that have a work ethic. I think it\u2019s a talent. No one\u2019s got any more of a talent for that than AD does. \u2026 He wants to play this game for as long as he can, and he knows he has to work hard to make that happen.\u201d Schofield\u2019s family background prepared him for four years of playing for Barnes. His father, Anthony, is a retired Senior Chief with the U.S. Navy. Older brother O\u2019Brien played football at the University of Wisconsin and spent seven seasons in the NFL, where he was part of a Super Bowl-winning team with Seattle in 2014. O\u2019Brien Schofield showed his brother how to work and carry himself like a professional. And Anthony didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the basketball drills he devised led to that shot against Gonzaga. \u201cSince I was a young kid, my dad would stand on the baseline under the rim and make me stand at half court,\u201d Schofield says. \u201cHe\u2019d just roll the ball anywhere, and wherever I caught it I would have to shoot it. That taught me range, that taught me feel, it taught me rhythm. \u201cAfter I got down the range and the feel of the shot, my dad would work on me getting it up high, and also getting it off quickly. But he would do it with a hand in my face. He wouldn\u2019t let me see the rim. He\u2019s a big guy.\u201d The result: After games of Jan. 9, Schofield was third in the SEC in scoring (18.0 ppg), fifth in field-goal percentage (.518) and third in 3-point percentage (.449). And Tennessee, ranked No. 3 in the nation, was 13-1. Though Schofield, an Illinois native, wasn\u2019t heavily recruited by power conference schools, his offensive numbers aren\u2019t too surprising. He always had a knack for scoring. He was recruited to Tennessee by former coach Donnie Tyndall but never played for him; Tyndall was fired after one season after alleged NCAA rules violations surfaced at his former school, Southern Miss. That left Schofield with a decision to make. Barnes replaced Tyndall, and Schofield wasn\u2019t sure if he could play for the new coach. Enter Dickey Simpkins, who played for Barnes at Providence and by coincidence was also Schofield\u2019s AAU coach. \u201c[Simpkins] was my closest mentor,\u201d Schofield says. \u201cHe gave me the rundown and told me [Barnes] could make me into a pro basketball player.\u201d Schofield was sold. There may have been times during Schofield\u2019s first two seasons when he cursed Simpkins\u2019 good name. As Barnes said, he was tough on Schofield. When the freshman showed up on campus in the summer of 2015, Barnes took one look at his 260-pound frame and promptly banned him from touching a basketball until he shed 30 pounds. \u201cWhile everyone else was working out, Admiral was running the treadmill,\u201d says Tennessee senior center Kyle Alexander, one of Schofield\u2019s closest friends on the team and another player Barnes has helped improved to the point where he harbors legitimate NBA aspirations. \u201cI remember mornings where I\u2019d go see if Admiral wanted to get breakfast, and he\u2019s not in his room. I go to the gym and he\u2019s been on the treadmill since 8 a.m., and it\u2019s 9:30. But he lost those 30 pounds.\u201d During his oversized seasons, Schofield was sometimes needed to play in the post. \u201cHe\u2019s in the game guarding 7-footers because I wasn\u2019t doing my job at that time,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cHe did what he had to do to help the team. But you could tell he wanted to make that transition to the wing. He spent the whole summer [of 2017] working out\u2014in the gym twice a day, on weekends, flying to places to work out. He was doing perimeter stuff, and trying to prove to coach Barnes he could guard the wing.\u201d Last season, after having grown an inch to 6-6 and sculpted himself into a ripped 241 pounds, Schofield earned his promotion to the perimeter and became one of the best players in the SEC \u2014 during a three-game stretch in late February and early March, when Schofield scored 25 points against Ole Miss, 24 against Mississippi State and 23 against Georgia, no player in the league was any better. Though his new position took him away from the basket, Schofield still led the Vols in rebounding. And after making 46 3s in 137 attempts in his first two seasons combined, he drained 64 of 162 attempts. Schofield returned to school this season determined to become an ever better all-around player. He had to prove to NBA scouts he could defend multiple positions and improve his passing skills. He\u2019s done that while increasing his scoring and rebounding numbers. Schofield was chosen SEC Player of the Week in successive weeks after a 29-point, 11-rebound effort in a win Memphis and his heroics against Gonzaga, which also earned him national player of the week honors. Now, along with Williams \u2014 yet another player who will one day find himself in the NBA despite being an unheralded high school recruit \u2014 and a cast of ever-improving teammates, Schofield has helped turn the Vols into a national championship contender. Barnes and his team have a narrow-minded focus to make this season last as long as it can, but despite that goal, staff and players are willing to talk about Schofield and the next level. \u201cHe\u2019s a pro,\u201d says associate head coach Rob Lanier, who has seen a few during his time by Barnes\u2019 side. \u201cHe has a professional approach to the game. His days revolve around getting better. I think there\u2019s a place for him in today\u2019s game, because he can really shoot the ball, he can defend multiple positions, and he\u2019s going to get better because he\u2019s going to keep working.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Since losing their first four games, they\u2019ve been near the top of the Western Conference, building a 25-15 record behind the league\u2019s best defense. They\u2019ve done so despite the absence of Andre Roberson, who made a huge difference for them defensively last season . Russell Westbrook has yielded some of the offense to Paul George, who\u2019s having a career year. Steven Adams has been one of the league\u2019s best two-way centers, and the supporting cast has done enough behind the three stars. The Thunder have wins over five of the other other teams currently in playoff position in the conference, but overall, they\u2019ve played the West\u2019s easiest schedule thus far. One of the teams they\u2019ve yet to face is the San Antonio Spurs, who they play twice in the next three days, in San Antonio on Thursday ( 9:30 p.m. ET, TNT ) and in Oklahoma City on Saturday ( 8 p.m. ET, NBA TV ). As good as the Thunder have been, there\u2019s still room for improvement. Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Thunder as the head into an important home-and-home series \u2026 The Thunder have an effective field goal percentage of just 45 percent on shots from outside the paint. That\u2019s the lowest mark in the league. We can\u2019t say that the Thunder have been the worst shooting team from outside the paint. The Atlanta Hawks have made a lower percentage of their shots from the outside (33.5 percent) than the Thunder (34.3 percent). But the Hawks have taken a greater percentage of their jump shots from beyond the arc. Atlanta\u2019s ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts is 4.3, the third highest in the league. The Thunder\u2019s ratio is 1.9, the league\u2019s 10th lowest rate and less than half that of the Hawks. (The league average is 2.2). So Atlanta has gotten more value out of their outside shots. The Thunder rank 24th in effective field goal percentage overall . They\u2019ve taken 38 percent of their shots , the league\u2019s fourth-highest rate, in the restricted area, where every team shoots best (and most effectively, even when taking the value of 3-pointers into account). Their ability to get to the basket helps make up for the poor shooting from the outside. Steven Adams (10.2) and Russell Westbrook (9.6) both rank in the top 15 in points per game in the restricted area . The Thunder have also been better than the league average in regard to taking care of the ball (ranking 12th in turnover percentage ) and getting to the free throw line (ranking 13th in FTA\/FGA ). They rank second in offensive rebounding percentage , having grabbed more than 30 percent of available offensive boards. The Thunder\u2019s No. 1 ranked defense also produces offense. They lead the league in opponent turnover percentage (17.3 per 100 possessions) and rank second with 20.5 *points per game off turnovers . No team has taken a greater percentage of its shots in the first 12 seconds of the shot clock. * Points off turnovers is a flawed statistic because it doesn\u2019t distinguish between live-ball and dead-ball turnovers. But the Thunder lead the league in opponent live-ball turnovers (recorded as steals) by a pretty wide margin. But the outside shooting is an issue. Shooting is the most important thing in the NBA and league-wide, offensive efficiency correlates stronger with effective field goal percentage from outside the paint than it does with field goal percentage in the paint. The Thunder are actually the only team that ranks in the bottom 10 in effective field goal percentage from outside the paint and has a winning record. Through Wednesday, the Thunder rank 20th offensively , having scored 107.6 points per 100 possessions. Only three teams \u2014 the Cavs, Bulls and Timberwolves \u2014 have seen a bigger drop in efficiency from last season, when the Thunder ranked seventh offensively (109.9 points scored per 100 possessions). They weren\u2019t a very good shooting team from the outside last season, but they weren\u2019t as bad as they are this year. They ranked 25th in effective field goal percentage from outside the paint (47.3 percent) in 2017-18. The Thunder have seven players who have taken at least 75 shots from outside the paint, and only two of the seven \u2014 Paul George and Jerami Grant \u2014 have an effective field goal percentage from the outside better than the league average (49.0 percent). Dennis Schroder has never been a very effective shooter from the outside. Terrance Ferguson isn\u2019t much more of a threat from the outside than Roberson was the last couple of seasons. Patrick Patterson has been a disappointment since coming from Toronto in 2017, and Alex Abrines has seen a big drop in 3-point percentage from last season. Of course, after George, the Thunder player who has taken the most shots from outside the paint is Westbrook, who ranks 53rd in mid-range field goal percentage (33.3 percent) among 54 players with at least 100 mid-range attempts and 165th in 3-point percentage (23.5 percent) among 165 players with at least 100 3-point attempts .  Westbrook has never been a good shooter from the outside, but this has been the worst jump-shooting season of his career. The mid-range field goal percentage is the worst of his career, while the 3-point percentage is the worst since his second season (when he took far fewer threes). Westbrook has cut down on pull-up jumpers, averaging 8.7 per game ( eighth most in the league ), down from 9.7 last season and 12.4 two seasons ago . According to Second Spectrum tracking, 19 percent of his jumpers have been off the catch, and that\u2019s the highest rate for him in the six years of tracking data (up from 11 percent last season). But he has shot worse (and less effectively) on catch-and-shoot jumpers ( 16-for-67, 24 percent, effective FG% of 34 percent ) than he has on pull-up jumpers ( 90-for-279, 32 percent, 36 percent ). The 2016-17 Kia MVP is averaging a triple-double for the third straight season and doing so with his lowest usage rate (30.4 percent) since his second year in the league . The Thunder offense has been 12.1 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (scoring 111.1 per 100) than with him off the floor (102.1). But you wonder how good it could be (and how high this team\u2019s ceiling would be) if he wasn\u2019t, essentially, the league\u2019s worst high-volume jump-shooter.

Except in this case, the victim was former two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry and the punisher was the notorious Patrick Beverley. And so the situation (of course) turned snippy. Beverley has fought against better players his entire basketball life and carries an underdog gene that tends to flare in these situations. That explains why he tried to slap the ball from the Warriors guard after the whistle. Curry wasn\u2019t having it, and so there was a gentle shove. And then a shove was returned. Then a staredown with noses just inches from each other. Then a separation of bodies.  This was Beverley doing what he does by reputation: namely, irritate and push his defensive aggression and agenda to the very limit \u2026 and then some. His \u201ccrime\u201d was restricting Curry\u2019s movement with a forearm. Sometimes Beverley gets away with it, but in today\u2019s NBA, no longer with any regularity. Such is the new normal. He\u2019s a defensive-minded player with the LA Clippers and works in a league that suddenly favors scoring and shooters. He\u2019s quite possibly, in his estimation and that of others, someone who\u2019s forced to evolve or perish. For him, there\u2019s no other option. \u201cIt would be very hard,\u201d Beverley said, \u201cto come into the league today and try to play defense like we did years ago.\u201d Before this season, the NBA\u2019s Points of Emphasis centered in part on freedom of movement . The goal is to help players move without barriers, which creates high-scoring games, which makes games more entertaining for fans. Halfway through the season, the evidence is convincing: Scores are up, stops are down. To date, 11 teams have an offensive rating greater than 110 and 18 teams are scoring more than 110 points per game . Last season, those numbers were six and six , respectively. For players born with height, wingspan and leaping ability, these defensive rules don\u2019t handcuff them much. But Beverley buys his clothes off the rack, so to speak. He\u2019s a shade over six feet and is therefore a normal man trying to make a living in a big man\u2019s world. At 30, Beverley deals with players who are often taller and even quicker. It\u2019s his job to make their life tougher \u2014 but here in the new age of barely-contested shots and 120-point games, the opposite is ringing true. He\u2019s averaging a career-high 3.6 fouls per game and can\u2019t get away with much. As Draymond Green, a defensive demon himself and teammate of Curry\u2019s said recently: \u201cDefense is not allowed. You can\u2019t really play defense in this league. I guess that\u2019s not what they want.\u201d Green\u2019s words are perhaps an extreme assessment and a touch of exaggeration. Fifteen teams averaged at least 106 ppg last season; now it\u2019s 26 . Calls are less forgiving, as only 13 teams are averaging 24 free throw attempts per game ( it was five last season ). The ball moves and there\u2019s less restriction, which was the intention. And there appears to be little blowback in the basketball universe from those who observe and play. It\u2019s just \u2026 accepted. For the most part. Even Beverley offers a shoulder shrug. \u201cGuys who make a living off defense, we\u2019re forced to adjust,\u201d he said.  This evolution of shifting away from certain defensive tactics is decades in the making. The NBA once allowed defenders to shove a forearm into the back of a post-up player, and subtle jersey grabs were often excused. And there was the hand-check, too. All have been outlawed. The game is far less physical, which means the \u201cBad Boys\u201d-era Detroit Pistons would have little chance of winning one championship today (let alone two). The NBA has sought to distance itself from that brand of ball, from Pat Riley\u2019s New York Knicks (and their \u201cno free layups\u201d mentality) and from the 85-80 scores that often stifled the creativity of the game. The result is a game that sees open lanes and quicker whistles, and less of what helped players like Beverley overcome tremendous odds to reach the NBA. \u201cThere is where we\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to see more scoring, more up-and-down, more points and all that, which is understandable. Of course, it makes it hard for me.\u201d This is Beverley\u2019s sixth year in the NBA, but his 10th in professional basketball. His journey curved through various stops overseas before he became rooted with the Houston Rockets, his first true NBA home. It speaks to Beverley\u2019s doggedness and his value, at least initially, as a defensive specialist assigned to the grunt work. With the rise in scoring point guards across the NBA landscape, Beverley\u2019s role became more important, and difficult as well. In a typical week, Beverley could guard Curry, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard and opposing shooting guards, too. He brings an edge to the job that he learned from growing up on the West Side of Chicago to a single mother as well as a grandmother who adopted a dozen kids. Daily life was a chore. He was one of the main characters in the documentary \u201cHoop Reality,\u201d the sequel to the acclaimed \u201cHoop Dreams.\u201d Beverley was friendly rivals with former Kia MVP winner Derrick Rose since grade school and was actually a scorer in high school, averaging a state-best 37 points as a senior. After getting kicked out of Arkansas in 2008 after two years for academic issues \u2014 a tutor wrote a paper for him \u2014 he played three years in Russia and Greece before filling the point guard void on the 2012-13 Rockets caused by Kyle Lowry\u2019s trade to Toronto the summer before . \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change one thing about how I got here,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get in through the front door. Sometimes you don\u2019t get in through the back. Sometimes you got to climb through the window. That doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity wasn\u2019t there. There\u2019s a way; you\u2019ve just got to find it.\u201d He immediately became singled out for eyeball-to-eyeball defense that teetered on the edge. The moment that earned him a name was in the first round of the 2013 playoffs against Oklahoma City. He went for a steal on Westbrook in Game 2 while Westbrook signaled for a timeout, causing his knee injury five years ago. He still answers for that, even to this day; not that the play on the ball was reckless, but was it necessary? \u201cI don\u2019t go out there to hurt people, I don\u2019t even know how to attempt to hurt somebody,\u201d Beverley said. \u201cI play hard, bring the edge. I\u2019m an instigator. That gets me going. I like to bump people, to feel me getting into somebody\u2019s jersey. I\u2019m just different. I like contact, like physical play, like pushing and holding. But I\u2019m not dirty.\u201d Beverley hasn\u2019t spoken with Westbrook \u2014 their on-court relationship is clearly frosty \u2014 and with the exception of Rose, he doesn\u2019t encourage any friendships beyond his teammates. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want personal battles that take away from the team. I\u2019m trying to win games. When I come to San Francisco or Oklahoma City or Portland, I know I\u2019m going straight to my room because there\u2019s people I got to be ready to play the next day. And I know they do the same. There\u2019s respect that\u2019s not being said. When it comes to Steph, Dame, Westbrook, I make sure I get my rest. But they get their rest, too. They know what I bring to the table.\u201d Beverley was an All-Defensive first teamer two seasons ago, both a career highlight and confirmation of his devotion to studying film and learning opponents\u2019 tendencies. He has also overcome microfracture knee injury in 2017-18 that limited him to 11 games in his debut season with the Clippers. \u201cI worked my ass off and I\u2019m still working,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not one thing it\u2019s another. Me getting hurt, coming back faster and stronger. Got kicked out of school, had to go overseas, knew I was going to the NBA anyway. I didn\u2019t know how. But I knew. \u201cThis is bigger than me. It\u2019s for my mom, grandmom, seeing how hard the women in my life worked to raise me. It\u2019s not easy being a single mother raising a kid in the inner city but she made it happen. She taught me to stand on my own two feet and get the best out of hard work, which becomes part of your mindset, especially when you see two women doing it every day.\u201d  And now comes another challenge for Beverley and those like him. How do you thrive in a league that\u2019s suddenly married to offense? \u201cMaybe after the All-Star break they\u2019ll stop calling ticky-tack fouls,\u201d he said. \u201cThe better defender you are, the more you\u2019re singled out. But I\u2019m going to go out there and be Pat. Don\u2019t care. Won\u2019t change.\u201d Beverley estimates that \u201c70 percent\u201d of the players he guards are rattled by him, to different degrees. He said \u201conly a few don\u2019t,\u201d which he refused to name (for strategic reasons). The game may not be designed to help the underdog, average-sized player who brings intensity and defense. But there\u2019s no sense waiting for Beverley to make excuses. He\u2019s come too far for that. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with this game, you don\u2019t want to go around saying, \u2018Man I wish I could\u2019ve done this, put more time into that.\u2019 \u201d Beverley said. \u201cEvery year I go out like a person fighting for my spot, fighting for my contract. That\u2019s the way I train. That\u2019s how I prepare. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still in the league.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

There have been some monster games in the past 14 days including the following: We\u2019ve just hit the midway point of the season , and big games should start becoming more common as teams falling further out of the playoff race give their youngsters more opportunities.  * * * Last week:  No. 1 Doncic dominated his third matchup with No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, notching 30 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals . It was Doncic\u2019s fourth 30-point game of the season , while no other rookie has more than one. It was also his seventh game with 20-5-5. All other rookies have combined for five such games. Over the past two weeks, the Slovenian has averaged 22.8 points, 6.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists while shooting 40 percent from 3-point land. Last week:  No. 2 While Ayton has had some monster games over the past two weeks \u2014 averaging 16.2 points and 9.7 rebounds over nine games \u2014 he\u2019s also had some clunkers in the New Year. In a 121-111 loss to the LA Clippers , Ayton finished with four points and five rebounds with four turnovers, then struggled mightily in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Mavs. In 20 minutes, the big man had six points and five rebounds while hitting just 1 of 7 shots. \u201dFor the first time, I think I ever, went scoreless in the first half and stuff like that just started to get to me a little bit,\u201d said Ayton, who was 1 of 7 from the field. \u201dIt was just me being the bad egg today. I\u2019m going to apologize to them about this, but yeah, it was a bad game for me.\u201d 3. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  Last week:  Not ranked Young has shot more consistently over the last two weeks, shooting 44.7 percent overall and 47.4 percent on 3-pointers. I\u2019ve hammered Young repeatedly for his poor shooting numbers, so I have to give him props for his turnaround. Over his last nine games, he\u2019s averaged 15.9 points and 7.6 assists and has generally looked more in control and selective with his shots. Young continues to lead rookies in assists at 7.3 per game , which puts him ninth among all players . 4. Kevin Knox, New York Knicks  Last week:  No. 3 Knox was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for December after averaging 17.1 points and six rebounds . The 6-foot-9 forward out of Kentucky is certainly on the rise, but also admitted he may not even be done growing. \u201cDoctors said I have a half-inch or an inch left in the tank,\u201d Knox told the New York Post recently . \u201cYou never know \u2014 hopefully I have an inch [left]. Maybe 6-10, 6-10\u00bd. If not, I\u2019m perfectly fine with where I\u2019m at.\u201d For his part, coach David Fizdale is letting his young prospect grow with more minutes and responsibility. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s gained momentum, and [I want to] keep him rolling. It\u2019s starting to become I need him on the court. That\u2019s pretty good to say about a 19-year-old. We need him out there.\u201d 5. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies  Last week:  Not ranked Jackson has scored in double figures in 10 of his last 11 games , but his rebounding and foul troubles are areas of concern. Jackson is first (or worst, depending on how you look at it) among all players in fouls per game (3.9) and is just sixth in rebounds per game among rookies . \u201cBecause of how long, tall and narrow he is, when guys lock him up he has a hard time escaping or staying on balance,\u201d Bickerstaff told The Commercial Appeal last week . \u201cTo be honest, with him, with his length and athleticism, he needs to be trying to escape people more and not let them get their hands or body on him where they can wedge him out.\u201d These are all things the 19-year-old will figure out, as Bickerstaff says. \u201cThe way he works, the way he studies, he\u2019s going to figure it out.\u201d * * * Rodions Kurucs, Brooklyn Nets Kurucs falls out of the top five, but it was a close call thanks to an impressive night in Boston. Kurucs tied a career high with 24 points . He finished 8-for-15 from the field, hitting a career-high five 3s on eight attempts. Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls Carter has scored in double-digits in five of his last seven games , with a pair of double-doubles to close out 2018. Most notably, he had a 17-point, 13-rebound, three-block showing in a win over the Wizards Dec. 28. Landry Shamet, Philadelphia 76ers Shamet not only scored a career-high 29 on Tuesday, but he also set personal bests by making eight 3s (one shy of Dana Barros\u2019 team record set in \u201895) on 14 attempts. He scored 15 of his points in the third quarter when he was 4-for-4 from beyond the arc . \u201cIt just happens,\u201d Shamet said afterward. \u201cThat might not be the answer you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019s just simple, and it just comes in the flow of everything.\u201d Frank Jackson, New Orleans Pelicans This could be an anomaly and Jackson won\u2019t stick around these parts, but he deserves some love for his work off the bench. With E\u2019Twaun Moore nursing a quad injury, Jackson has stepped up, scoring 17 points in a win on Monday, followed by 19 in Wednesday\u2019s win over the Cavs. Jackson was 11-for 15 overall in the two games, going 7-for-12 from 3-point land (7-for-7 from the FT line). Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton has scored in double figures in his last six games , but the Cavs are mired in an 11-game skid and the rookie is dealing with his own shooting woes. During the slide, Sexton is shooting 32.4 percent from the field, 35.5 percent on 3-pointers. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 9 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Star guard Kyrie Irving said Wednesday that a team meeting held after a Dec. 21 home loss to the Milwaukee Bucks helped players to clear the air about several topics. \u201cWe could pinpoint a lot of turning points,\u201d Irving told reporters after last night\u2019s win vs. Indiana, per ESPN\u2019s Tim Bontemps . \u201cWe just want to build that chemistry first. Just getting with one another, really put everything out there and then move on from that point. \u201cAt that point, playing against Milwaukee, we weren\u2019t at rock bottom, but we needed to address some [expletive] in this locker room. It\u2019s just good to get stuff out in the air. As grown men and guys that have expectations for themselves, it was good to hear guys talk about what they wanted for themselves and what they wanted for this team.\u201d The Celtics dismantled the Indiana Pacers 135-108 to notch their fourth straight win, with the victory coming largely because of Boston\u2019s willingness to share the ball. The victory marked their fifth straight game with at least 30 assists (after failing to reach that mark in nine of their previous 10 games ). Since Dec. 23, the Celtics rank No. 2 in assist percentage (70.2) and are among the league leaders in offensive rating, net rating, true shooting percentage and more during that span. The Celtics had 32 assists last night and put together their highest scoring game this season. Boston (25-15) also ended a three-game skid against the Pacers, who entered the night third in the Eastern Conference having won seven of eight. Additionally, Boston led 68-53 at halftime after shooting 56.5 percent (26 for 46) in the first half. That Dec. 23 date is an important one, since it was Boston\u2019s next game after the Bucks loss that capped off a three-game losing streak. After that loss to the Bucks, the Celtics were mired in the lower-half of the Eastern Conference standings and had their team meeting. The Celtics have seen a slight uptick in pace (they rank 18th in that category overall) since Dec. 1 , and are getting more comfortable in terms of team chemistry. Overall, Boston has won seven of its last nine games to stay within striking distance of the upper crust in the East. \u201dWe\u2019re all understanding that we\u2019re trying to play faster and the ball movement has been working for us,\u201d said Al Horford, who led Boston last night with eight assists. \u201dIt keeps the defense on their toes, really makes the other team work. It\u2019s kind of contagious.\u201d \u201cWell, you see the type of connection that we have out there in terms of our pick-and-roll and what we do and how we talk is pretty seamless,\u201d Irving said, per Mark Murphy of the Boston Herald . \u201cWe came in the same time and have this understanding of where our journeys have started and where it is now and an appreciation of where we are. So we just want to take full advantage of it for this year.\u201d Since Thanksgiving, the Celtics are No. 1 in offensive rating , have a net rating of 11.2 (tops in the NBA) and are 16-6 (the best record in the league). In short, Boston is finding its way \u2014 at least over the last few weeks \u2014 and developing chemistry with a roster filled with talent. \u201cIt was hard to find good clips at the start of the year,\u201d coach Brad Stevens said, per the Boston Herald . \u201cAnd I think some of that was because we were pressing; some of that was because we missed shots when the ball was moving. All looks a little bit better when it finishes with a make, but that\u2019s who we have to be.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36404,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/vince-carter-unsure-if-farewell-season","date":"2019-01-10","title":"Carter grateful for warm reception Nets, Raptors have given him","content":" NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Vince Carter looked up at the highlights, enjoying the view of himself back in the days when he was among the NBA\u2019s highest flyers. He\u2019s about to turn 42, now in his 21st season, and he doesn\u2019t jump quite like the guy being shown Wednesday night on the Barclays Center overhead screens. The Nets honored Carter, who is the oldest active player, with a tribute video during their game against Atlanta, a way to say thank you for his 4 + seasons with the franchise. \u201cIt was great. Any time you can see old video of when you were young and spry and springy and all of that good stuff, I mean, it\u2019s always great to see,\u201d Carter said. Good times, yes. But was it goodbye? Carter hasn\u2019t said if he plans to retire following the season. He would make NBA history if he returns, as nobody has played 22 seasons in the league. So was the video premature? \u201cI\u2019m OK with it. Either way it\u2019s cool,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful for it, that they even considered it. \u201cWhen it was mentioned to me I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019 \u201d The video was played in the first half, shortly after Carter had come off the Hawks\u2019 bench for the first time. He received ovations from the crowd both times, and he acknowledged the fans after the video played. He never played in Brooklyn but was one of their best when the Nets played in New Jersey, ranking third on the franchise scoring list while playing in the backcourt alongside Jason Kidd. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t in this building, but nevertheless the feeling is still the same,\u201d Carter said. \u201cMy five years here was fun, a lot of fun. J-Kidd made it obviously easy to play the game up and down and create a lot of highlights and memories, so it was awesome to see.\u201d The Hawks\u2019 road trip has been right down Carter\u2019s memory lane. They played Tuesday in Toronto, where he began his career and has repaired his relationship with fans that was damaged when he pushed for the trade that landed him in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s a great trip. Stressful sometimes, a lot of people to see, but the appreciation I\u2019m very thankful for and I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAnd like I said, the video, yes it could be premature, or not. It\u2019s still, they\u2019re thinking about me and I\u2019m very thankful for that.\u201d He\u2019s still productive, starting eight games and averaging 7.2 points, with a 21-point performance last month. If he comes back, he breaks a tie with Kevin Garnett, Robert Parish and Kevin Willis for the most NBA seasons. (Dirk Nowitzki, like Carter drafted in 1998, is also in his 21st season). Carter was informed during his postgame interview that he was overheard as he was leaving the arena Tuesday in Toronto telling someone that he would see him next year. \u201cReally?\u201d Carter said with a laugh. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you guys next year.\u201d"},{"id":36425,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-9-19","date":"2019-01-10","title":"About Last Night: Giannis wins head-to-head battle with Harden","content":"In a matchup of Kia MVP contenders, Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s 20-20 performance bested James Harden\u2019s 42-point outburst in the Bucks\u2019 116-109 victory over the Rockets. Antetokounmpo was a physical presence on both ends of the floor, collecting 27 points and a career-high 21 rebounds, as Milwaukee battled back from a 60-54 halftime deficit to end the Rockets\u2019 10-game home winning streak. Antetokounmpo also dished five assists, but the pass that had social media buzzing was one that knocked Harden to the floor. Early in the fourth quarter, Antetokounmpo was backing down P.J. Tucker when he whipped the ball towards the corner, in the direction of Malcolm Brogdon. The missile struck Harden above his right temple; he needed a moment to compose himself. What added insult to injury for Harden was the ball bounced back across the lane to Antetokounmpo, who dished to Ersan Ilyasova for a 3-pointer. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what happened,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI think the ball somehow came back into his hands \u2026 wish I would have seen it.\u201d Harden made history in the loss by recording his 14th straight 30-point game. Only Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant have had such streaks since the NBA-ABA merger. Programming note: Bucks vs. Rockets re-airs Jan. 10 on NBA TV at 5:00 p.m. ET Kuz control  Kyle Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in just his second game returning from a lower back injury, even as he sat out the entire fourth quarter of the Lakers\u2019 113-100 victory over the Pistons. That\u2019s the most points by a Laker in fewer than 30 minutes played in the shot clock era (since 1954-55). Kuzma also also became the fifth player this season to score 40 points in three quarters, joining Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James and Klay Thompson. Kuzma posted 22 points in the third quarter, hitting four 3-pointers to get the crowd on its feet and scoring on consecutive goaltending calls. He left with 1 minute, 7 seconds to play and put a wrap around his midsection with a pack stuffed in the back.  A rallying call for defense made famous by Duke, the floor slap isn\u2019t something usually seen in the NBA \u2014 or Europe. It\u2019s possible Luka Doncic had never seen the gesture before. Regardless, Doncic responded to Kelly Oubre\u2019s challenge with a fadeaway jumper right over him. Doncic finished with 30 points and the Mavs ended a seven-game losing streak against the Suns with a 104-94 victory . On a night when six of of the 16 teams in action were playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the better rested teams held a big advantage. Five of the six teams were handed double-digit losses, including the Cavs, Hawks, Pacers, Sixers and Suns. The only team playing on consecutive nights that won was the Wizards, who played a home-and-home series with Philadelphia (which has lost six of its eight games this season in the second game of back-to-back sets). The Pacers\u2019 135-108 loss to the Celtics was the most glaring, as Boston posted its highest-scoring game this season against one of the top defensive teams in the NBA. \u201cIt just looked like we were gassed tonight,\u201d Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. Anthony Davis had another huge game in the Pelicans\u2019 140-124 victory over the Cavs, collecting 38 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and four blocks (two of which came within two seconds of each other). . One night after receiving a standing ovation in Toronto, Vince Carter got a similar reception in Brooklyn, complete with a video tribute . Carter, who played five seasons for the Nets, ranks third in franchise history in scoring average (23.6) and 3-pointers made (638). However, the lovefest ended in the second quarter when Rodions Kurucs inadvertently elbowed Carter in the face. Kurucs went to check up on him, but Carter smacked his hand away. Blake Griffin failed to grab a rebound for the first time in his career (567 games), finishing with 16 points, six assists and four turnovers in 37 minutes."},{"id":36405,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-patrick-mccaw-sign-toronto-raptors","date":"2019-01-09","title":"Reports: Patrick McCaw plans to sign with Raptors","content":" Free agent guard Patrick McCaw plans to sign with the Toronto Raptors, according to reports from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Shams Charania of The Athletic.

He agreed to an offer sheet with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Dec. 28, which the Warriors elected to not match. After three games with the Cavaliers, McCaw was waived on Sunday before his contract would have been guaranteed for the remainder of the season.

Tests showed Noel avoided any fractures from the spill and he was released from the hospital after an overnight stay. Noel will now begin the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol. Noel was taken off the court on a stretcher in the third quarter of Tuesday\u2019s game against Minnesota after the Timberwolves\u2019 Andrew Wiggins made contact with him on a dunk attempt. Noel took an elbow in the face as Wiggins went up, and Noel\u2019s head hit the ground hard. A defensive foul was called on Noel. The play was reviewed, and no additional fouls were called. Noel was down for several minutes before being taken from the court. Players from both teams jawed at each other while Noel was on the ground.

Not sure who, not sure how, but hoops president Masai Ujiri needs to upgrade his team not just for the coming Eastern Conference stretch drive and early playoff rounds but to further try to persuade Kawhi Leonard he can find long-term happiness with They The North. Currently, there\u2019s a grimness to the Raptors season \u2014 even the victories move them incrementally closer to the day most expect Leonard to leave. That\u2019s the opposite of the joy this team should be feeling, and it\u2019s only going to get worse as the days tick by. The Finals is a realistic target but it\u2019s hard to play your best basketball with one eye locked on the calendar. Tas Melas :  I can\u2019t make just one. 1. The Lakers don\u2019t make a trade before the deadline. 2. The Pistons miss out on the playoffs. 3. Brook Lopez wins the 3-Point Contest. Shaun Powell :  LeBron James will suffer through a series of nagging injuries after healing from his sore groin, the Lakers will miss the playoffs and Luke Walton will take the hit. Well, you said \u201cbold\u201d prediction, right? This is pretty bold, considering LeBron almost never gets hurt, but Father Time works in mysterious ways and until now has adopted a hands-off approach to the game\u2019s greatest player. At some point, though, the bill comes due for all that mileage on the body. John Schuhmann :  Either the Los Angeles Lakers or San Antonio Spurs would miss the playoffs , meaning that either LeBron James\u2019 streak of 13 straight trips or the Spurs\u2019 streak of 21 straight trips to the postseason is coming to an end. (I\u2019m not sure I actually believe this, but you asked for something \u201cbold.\u201d) The Utah Jazz have (with the exception of their game in Milwaukee on Monday) been defending like they did in the second half of last season and, with the league\u2019s most home-heavy second-half schedule (25 of 41 games at Vivint Smart Home Arena), are primed to move up from ninth place in the Western Conference . The Spurs have been on fire, but have benefited from a home-heavy stretch over the last month and are still just 7-12 on the road after their win in Detroit on Monday. The Lakers, meanwhile, are just two games ahead of the Jazz for eighth place. They\u2019re heavily dependent on a guy that\u2019s currently injured, and could be without him when they play in Utah on Friday. Sekou Smith :  I love the shock value of a bold prediction this time of year. It comes with so much season to play that only a few petty and meticulous of you will remember it and throw in my face months from now (if I\u2019m wrong). So after four glorious years of going back and forth between the Bay Area and Cleveland for The Finals, we\u2019re getting two new locations this season (we knew the Cleveland leg of the trip was going to change). Oklahoma City, Houston, Denver and Los Angeles all qualify for the preliminary list of alternative Western Conference possibilities. And no, I\u2019m not knocking the Golden State Warriors. I understand exactly who and what they are at their very best. This is simply an acknowledgement of how difficult it is for any team, even an all-time great one, to make five straight trips to the promised land. * * * > Midseason Report Cards:  Eastern Conference | Western Conference"},{"id":36414,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-midseason-coach-year-favorite-2018-19-0","date":"2019-01-09","title":"Blogtable: Who's your Coach of the Year winner at midseason?","content":" * * * Who\u2019s your midseason Coach of the Year?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Too soon to say Ryan Saunders? OK, then I\u2019ll give you my picks according to the three-spot ballot: 1. Mike Malone, Denver. 2. Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee. 3. Nate McMillan, Indiana. Budenholzer has revamped the Xs & Os for the Bucks, as well as the culture. McMillan is making a habit of quietly guiding the Pacers to overachievement. But Malone gets my nod for his year-over-year work with this ensemble cast, a crew that was ripe for a superstar addition last summer. The Nuggets didn\u2019t get one, shrugged and went about their job anyway, with Nikola Jokic as first among equals. Tas Melas :  Nate McMillan. It\u2019s easy to look at the Pacers roster and say: \u201cThere\u2019s Victor Oladipo, and then there\u2019s everyone else.\u201d Well, Oladipo has missed a quarter of the season and they\u2019re on pace for 55 wins, very close to the top of the East. McMillan has gotten so much out of that next tier of guys in his locker room (Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young, Domantas Sabonis), but their names aren\u2019t sexy in the NBA world, so he hasn\u2019t received the credit he deserves. Mike Budenholzer should get plenty of love, too. But considering Milwaukee has had a fairly healthy roster and a home-heavy first half, I could see the Pacers surpassing them in the standings. Shaun Powell :  I like how Mike Budenholzer in his first year completely transformed the Bucks\u2019 offense \u2014 turning them from among the most bashful 3-point shooters to one of the most prolific \u2014 while keeping his meal ticket happy by showcasing Giannis for MVP and also selling the star on the value of defense. Because of this, the conference-leading Bucks might be the team to beat in the East. John Schuhmann :  As usual, there are a lot of good candidates. Billy Donovan, Dave Joerger, Mike Malone, Nate McMillan, Gregg Popovich and Doc Rivers all deserve consideration. But when a team makes a huge improvement in the wake of a coaching change with minimal turnover in key personnel, it\u2019s hard not to see the impact that the coach has made. The Milwaukee Bucks have been the league\u2019s most improved team on defense ( allowing 4.8 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season ) and its fourth most improved team on offense (scoring 4.7 more). They\u2019re the only team that ranks in the top five on both ends of the floor and have the league\u2019s biggest pace-adjusted point differential by a wide margin. Mike Budenholzer has got to be the favorite for Coach of the Year at this point. Sekou Smith :  Mike Budenholzer (Milwaukee) and Mike Malone (Denver) share the top spot on my ballot at the midseason break . Refusing to choose one over the other seems like a cop-out. But we\u2019ve got roughly three months for one of these guys to separate himself. In the meantime, we should appreciate what a fresh set of eyes has done for the Bucks. Bundenholzer revamped things for Giannis Antetokounmpo and crew, vaulting the Bucks to the top of the standings in the Eastern Conference. Malone has produced similar results in Denver by convincing his group that the\u2019d have to defend at the highest level if they were really tired of watching the playoffs instead of participating. * * * > Midseason Report Cards:  Eastern Conference | Western Conference"},{"id":36411,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-surprise-halfway-point-season","date":"2019-01-09","title":"Blogtable: Biggest surprise at halfway point of 2018-19?","content":" * * * What\u2019s the biggest surprise at the halfway point of this season?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  If I focus on \u201cbiggest,\u201d I\u2019m saying how thoroughly the bottom has dropped out of the Washington Wizards\u2019 season. Their miserable start, Dwight Howard\u2019s reliable unavailability and other hiccups, trading Kelly Oubre Jr., now John Wall\u2019s surgery\u2026 yikes, what a mess, and a vast departure from what I thought would be a solid middle-seed season. If I focus on \u201csurprise,\u201d which suggests something more positive than negative, I\u2019ve got to admit I didn\u2019t see the Clippers playing at their current level. They\u2019ve sewn together a laudable quilt of scorers, facilitators, defenders, role players and leaders. They hit their 3-pointers at a good rate and tend to the arc at the other end, while taking care of business at the foul line. OK, so the Clippers are only five victories from sub-.500 but for the moment, they\u2019re looking down at three or four teams most folks figured they\u2019d be chasing. Tas Melas :  From a team perspective, the Sacramento Kings are at a level of, dare I say, respect? The Kings needed a couple young players to make a significant jump in order to be good and De\u2019Aaron Fox has become an elite NBA player in only Year Two. That\u2019s where it all starts. Additionally, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Willie Cauley-Stein have also gotten better and they\u2019ve all been aided by the pace at which coach Dave Joerger has decided to play. And they averted a \u2018front-office-is-trying-to-manage-the-roster\u2019 crisis in November. The Kings did that! Pretty unbelievable. Shaun Powell :  Have to say the Celtics sitting in fifth place at the break . Sure, they\u2019re only a handful of games out of first and all they need is a Houston Rockets-like streak to stake claim for first place. But with Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving back healthy and another season of experience for Jayson Tatum, the Celtics were built for a strong start. They may eventually wind up winning 50-plus games anyway and travel deep in the postseason \u2026 but with all due respect, they\u2019re right now looking up at the Indiana Pacers in the East standings? John Schuhmann :  There are the usual suspects \u2014 Denver, Indiana, Sacramento and the Clippers \u2014 on the team level. But I keep looking at the leaders in 3-point percentage and seeing a couple of names that shouldn\u2019t be there. Through Tuesday, Derrick Rose (46 percent) and T.J. Warren (44 percent) rank fourth and 12th in the league in 3-point percentage, respectively. The league is taking a greater percentage of its shots from 3-point range for the eighth straight season and a lot of guys are attempting more threes than they ever have. But accuracy is another thing. Rose had shot 30 percent from 3-point range prior to this season and was 20-for-90 (22 percent) in 89 games over the last two years. Warren, meanwhile, was Mr. 2-pointer. Last season, he took only eight percent of his shots, the league\u2019s fifth lowest rate among non-bigs with at least 500 field goal attempts, from 3-point range. That number is 30 percent this season and Warren has almost doubled the percentage of his threes that have gone through the net. Rudy Gay (41 percent) was once the president of the \u201cHow is he among the leaders in 3-point percentage\u201d club, ranking second in the league for a while, and would still be in the top 25 if he had enough attempts to qualify.  Sekou Smith :  Brooklyn and Sacramento are authoring seasons that could very well land both franchises in the playoffs, which would no doubt count as big surprises. But it\u2019s the LA Clippers who have been the biggest surprise to me at the halfway point. When a team sheds the likes of Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan (not to mention quality supporting players like J.J. Redick, Jamal Crawford and others) over the course of a season and a half, a full-blown rebuild is usually a given. That the Clippers not only resisted that proposed reality is admirable in itself. The fact that coach Doc Rivers has guided his team to the top four of the Western Conference standings is nothing short of amazing. Kudos to all involved in L.A. for sticking to their own plan and obliterating the expectations. And this is setting up a huge free-agent summer for both tenants of Staples Center. * * * > Midseason Report Cards:  Eastern Conference | Western Conference"},{"id":46661,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/legendary-moments-bucks-end-lakers-33-game-win-streak","date":"2019-01-09","title":"Legendary Moments in NBA history: Bucks end Lakers' 33-game win streak","content":"On Oct. 31, 1971, the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors 109-105 to fall to 6-3.

Cousins has been recovering from a left Achilles injury that he suffered last season during his stint with the New Orleans Pelicans. The targeted date would mark 357 days since the All-Star big man went down. Per Connor Letourneau of The San Francisco Chronicle and Marc J. Spears of The Undefeated , information was confirmed that Cousins would look to suit up on Jan. 18. After the Warriors\u2019 122-95 win against the New York Knicks , coach Steve Kerr conceded that Cousins could suit up even earlier than that. \u201cI think it\u2019ll happen around that (Jan. 18) time,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as, \u2018That\u2019s the game.\u2019 It\u2019s somewhere in that neighborhood. Now that we\u2019re getting closer, and like I told you guys yesterday, he\u2019s made some big strides the last week or two conditioning-wise, so if that continues and (director of sports medicine and performance) Rick (Celebrini) tells us that he\u2019s ready to go, then it could be that game. \u201dMaybe it\u2019s the New Orleans game a couple of days earlier (on Jan. 16). Maybe it\u2019s the first game after that, but that\u2019s definitely the range.\u201d Cousins hasn\u2019t played since last January, when the catastrophic tendon injury prematurely ended his eighth NBA season while playing for the Pelicans. He has made significant strides in his rehab work and, if he returns on Jan. 18, would have 36 games to get into a rhythm before the playoffs. He has been practicing with the Warriors since early November and recently participated in three practices with the Warriors\u2019 G League affiliate in Santa Cruz . \u201cWe obviously want him coming back into a good vibe. That would be nice,\u201d Warriors star guard Stephen Curry said after Tuesday\u2019s win, \u201cand us feeling good about ourselves with a guy like DeMarcus Cousins back in the lineup, so that\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Cousins, a four-time All-Star, averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 48 games for the Pelicans last season . Just three weeks ago, Cousins dunked on teammate Kevin Durant in a good-natured, post-practice game of one-on-one. Per Spears, the Warriors have enjoyed Cousins\u2019 presence in the locker room all season, as his experience and sense of humor has helped younger players such as Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell and Damian Jones. Overall, Cousins has made big strides in his conditioning improvement in recent weeks. Still, Kerr isn\u2019t about to have oversized expectations for when Cousins does return. \u201cWe have a decent idea how we\u2019d like to use DeMarcus and in what rotations,\u201d Kerr said Tuesday night. \u201cIt might not be as simple as `This looks good on paper.\u2019 \u201d It might also be wise for Golden State to temper its expectations of what Cousins can do, writes Letourneau. He reports that seven of the 18 players who suffered major Achilles injuries from 1988-2011 did not come back to the league . In general, big men typically have a tougher time overcoming Achilles injuries. \u201cJust seeing him progress since he\u2019s been here, he\u2019s been putting in a lot of work in his rehab,\u201d Durant told the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what to expect out of his first game.

Let\u2019s talk about it. In their first game since the firing of coach Tom Thibodeau , the Minnesota Timberwolves escaped Chesapeake Arena with a 119-117 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Andrew Wiggins went off for a season-high 40 points and 10 rebounds, while interim coach Ryan Saunders earned his first victory. The 32-year-old coach is the son of the late Flip Saunders, who coached the Timberwolves for 11 seasons in two stints and passed away in 2015. Minnesota dedicated this win to him. Ryan, who became the youngest coach to win in his coaching debut since Dave Cowens in 1978, wore a \u201cFlip\u201d pin on his jacket lapel throughout the game and was mobbed by his players after the final buzzer. He was also doused with water in the locker room. Sixers guard Landry Shamet came off the bench and drilled eight 3-pointers in Philadelphia\u2019s 132-115 win over the Washington Wizards. It\u2019s the most 3s hit in a game by a rookie this season and one shy of the Sixers\u2019 franchise record. The 21-year-old was so hot Joel Embiid had to check his temperature. Much isn\u2019t made about divisions these days, but the Timberwolves and Thunder continue to compete during each matchup and make it a true rivalry. Six of their last seven meetings have had a final score within four points, and both of their games this season have been within two. One player who tends to show up in these games is Andrew Wiggins, who recorded his season high in scoring (40), on the glass (10) and at the line (16). Last season, Wiggins hit a deep buzzer-beater in Oklahoma City that gave Minnesota the win. On Tuesday, he did it all during the late stages of the game. With 2:12 remaining in the fourth, Wiggins had a clutch jumper, block and assist that helped secure a Timberwolves victory. When the Toronto Raptors found themselves in a late battle with the lowly Atlanta Hawks, the best player on the floor stepped up and did what he does best. Defend. Kawhi Leonard posted a season-high six steals, none bigger than the one he grabbed with 24.1 seconds left and the Raptors down one. His forced turnover led to a Serge Ibaka dunk on the other end, which set the Hawks up for one last possession. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce turned to rookie Trae Young and Raptors boss Nick Nurse called on two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year Leonard. Not much of a surprise as to who won that battle. Nerlens Noel went down with a scary injury after being elbowed by Wiggins and hitting his head hard on the floor. Players across the NBA wished him well, including Wiggins himself. The Golden State Warriors breezed past the New York Knicks behind Klay Thompson\u2019s 43-point eruption. After playing their 41st game of the season \u2015 the official midway point of an 82-game regular season schedule \u2015Thompson was asked how he felt at the season\u2019s halfway mark. \u201cI feel great,\u201d Thompson said in a postgame interview. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the halfway mark. It\u2019s a third for us.\u201d Well, with one-third of their season completed, the Warriors are about to be even better as of Jan. 18 . Vince Carter spent the first six and a half seasons of his career in Toronto, mesmerizing fans with dunks and memorable performances. Carter was greeted with to a memorable moment on Tuesday at Scotiabank Arena, where the former Raptors icon received a standing ovation . On the Hawks\u2019 first possession, the \u2018Half Man, Half Amazing\u2019 got the ball in his hands and drained an open 3. While many suggest this could be the last time Carter hits the court up North, he hasn\u2019t fully drawn that conclusion himself. The Raptors third all-time scorer told TSN\u2019s Josh Lewenberg he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d retiring right now. Clemson\u2019s bludgeoning of Alabama in the College Football National Championship left Cavaliers rookie Collin Sexton with a price to pay. The former Crimson Tide point guard made a friendly bet with teammate and Clemson alum Jaron Blossomgame. He\u2019s a man of his word.

McCaw played three games with the Cavs, who waived him Sunday and did so before his contract would have been guaranteed for the remainder of this season. McCaw cleared waivers and is now an unrestricted free agent. McCaw averaged 4.0 points in 128 regular-season appearances with the Warriors in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons. He scored five points in the three appearances with the Cavaliers."},{"id":36447,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-injury-updates-ricky-rubio-thabo-sefolosha-tony-bradley","date":"2019-01-09","title":"Jazz's Ricky Rubio, Thabo Sefolosha have hamstring strains, Tony Bradley has knee surgery","content":" SALT LAKE CITY  \u2014 The following is a medical update on Utah Jazz guard Ricky Rubio, forward Thabo Sefolosha and center Tony Bradley: Rubio (6-4, 190, Spain) was examined Tuesday by the Utah Jazz medical staff and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing and the MRI revealed a mild right hamstring strain.

He planned to be back in action sometime in 2019, but that timeline is being pushed back, it seems. Love spoke with reporters Monday after practice and said it is looking more like he may return closer to the All-Star break. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Love said . \u201cIt\u2019s really tough for me to say because I don\u2019t know how my foot is going to respond. I didn\u2019t know what the doctor was going to say in New York, but I think just if I\u2019m feeling good and I progress well than hopefully it will be sooner rather than later. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Love suffered his injury in the Cavs\u2019 preseason opener. On Nov. 2, he had surgery to remove remove cartilage and have fluid drained from the base of his left big toe by Dr. Martin O\u2019Malley at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. At the time, the team said Love would be out at least six weeks and his status would be updated in \u201capproximately\u201d when that period ended. Love said in an interview on ESPN in mid-November that he expects \u201cto be back sometime after the new year.\u201d Love said he\u2019s going to in a restrictive boot for two more weeks. Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com , Love had a follow-up appointment with his doctors in New York last Wednesday. At that point, Love said he would be able to increase his therapy and add a few more basketball activities. He said Monday he was happy with what he heard from his doctor in terms of his progress from the injury. Overall, Love has taken a slow-but-steady approach to his rehab work. \u201cI think just kind of go with the symptoms,\u201d Love said. \u201cLike if I\u2019m feeling anything we\u2019ll just kind of keep it at that pace, just a progression from here. But I think I\u2019ll get more of an idea of that over the next couple weeks and then from there there will be even more progression and get out on the court. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to go one on one, two on two, three on three, but I think that\u2019s all part of the next few weeks I\u2019d say.\u201d A five-time All-Star, Love signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension this summer. He said Monday he has no plans of shutting himself down for 2018-19. \u201cThat\u2019s never really been the thought process \u2014 at least for me,\u201d Love said. \u201cI know going out there, I want to play. I want to be out there with those guys. I feel like I would be letting my teammates down and letting LD (Larry Drew) and the coaching staff down if I didn\u2019t get out there and play and get out there and play as soon as I could so long as I\u2019m healthy. \u201cI would just hope to come back whether it be right before All-Star break, after All-Star break just things to start trending in the right direction and give the fans and this organization some hope for better times that are going to be here.\u201d In addition, his name has circulated in some trade rumors.

Clint Capela is first in line on Houston\u2019s don\u2019t-forget-about-him list. Meanwhile PJ Tucker continues to clock in and out. The Rockets never have to wonder what life would be like without him, because the truck-like iron man hasn\u2019t missed more than four games in a season since returning from Europe. He is one of just six players to average over 35 minutes per game, yet his 6.7 shot attempts per game are more than 10 fewer than next most unselfish player on that list (Jrue Holiday at 16.8) That\u2019s not to say Tucker won\u2019t shoot if he\u2019s open \u2014 as West-best Denver found out on Monday. The veteran swingman scorched the Nuggets for five 3-pointers in the first half alone and seven by the time Houston was done with its 125-113 victory. Tucker\u2019s offensive outburst was accompanied by his now trademark defensive aggression: a game-high seven deflections, 15 box-outs and 11 contested shots (second only to Capela). Yet it\u2019s Tucker\u2019s career-high mark from 3 (a sparkling 40 percent) that has helped keep the Rockets elite despite the offseason losses of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute. There was a time when Tucker was one of the worst-shooting wing players in the league. That was 2012-13 \u2014 six years after Toronto originally drafted Tucker in the second round. He lasted just 17 games with the Raptors before spending the next five years playing in almost every European league imaginable. The post-Nash Suns needed a defensive minded presence, so they brought the 6-foot-6 forward in for a trial run. Tucker stuck, becoming a fan favorite for his non-stop hustle and easily visible competitiveness. He was a bright spot for a Suns team that finished 25-57, but his impact appeared limited thanks to a 31.4-percent shooting clip from beyond the arc. The summer of 2013, Tucker spent nearly every day conquering 3-point shooting drills on Phoenix\u2019s practice court. The following season, his long-range efficiency jumped over seven percent (38.7). Fast forward to present day, where Tucker has cemented himself as an indispensable part of the contending Rockets. Leave him open in the right corner, and it\u2019s virtually a coin flip that he\u2019ll hit. In terms of durability and aggression, Tucker\u2019s as close to 100 percent as it gets. Ditto for his pregame attire: James Harden can be mean to people\u2019s feet. Remember Wesley Johnson? \u200b The reigning Kia MVP re-enacted the crime against Denver, using a behind-the-back dribble that left Jamal Murray\u2019s face meeting hardwood. \u200b The reactions were almost as good as the play itself. \u200b In the pantheon of coaches, a present-day great has pulled even with a retired one. Gregg Popovich tied Jerry Sloan\u2019s 1,221 career wins thanks to the Spurs\u2019 119-107 win at Detroit. The last time Pop\u2019s Spurs didn\u2019t make the playoffs: Two extremely important former Raptors made time to greet each other before their new teams tipped off. Weird stat from Dallas\u2019 107-97 loss to the Lakers: Luka Doncic was the only Mavs starter to score in the second half until 5:19 remained in the fourth quarter. In that span, the Slovenian rookie shot 6-for-10 for 14 points. The other starters: 0-for-13. Anthony Davis (36 points, 13 rebound) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (30 points, 10 rebounds) dominated in their respective teams\u2019 wins on Monday. Their combination of basket-making and glass-eating prowess is almost unequaled. The two have combined for 27 of the league\u2019s 30-point, 10-rebound efforts this season \u2014 more than one quarter of 103 such performances so far in 2018-19."},{"id":36448,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/release-lakers-nets-nba-china-games-2019","date":"2019-01-08","title":"Lakers, Nets to play in 13th edition of NBA China Games","content":" NEW YORK AND BEIJING \u2014 T he National Basketball Association (NBA) announced Monday that the NBA China Games 2019 Presented by Vivo will feature two preseason games between the 16-time NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.

The Houston Rockets agreed to trade Carter-Williams and cash to the Bulls for a conditional, heavily protected second-round Draft pick. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was first to report the deal. The Bulls quickly waived Carter-Williams because his contract would become guaranteed by 5 p.m. on Monday. The Bulls also waived swingman MarShon Brooks, who was acquired by Chicago in a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies last week . The move allows the Rockets to clear a roster space for undrafted rookie Danuel House, who has become a valuable contributor for Houston and is approaching the 45 days allotted on his two-way contract. Carter-Williams played for the Bulls in the 2016-17 season, landing there in an offseason trade with the Milwaukee Bucks .

Tom Thibodeau firing shines light on difficulty of coach-president responsibilities","content":" And again there is one. Gregg Popovich is famous for his longevity in outlasting rival NBA coaches. As in, there have been 247 hirings\/firings (per the Associated Press) since Popovich took over in San Antonio in December 1996. But outlasting a recent trend in his profession \u2013 one man handling his coaching responsibilities while also holding final authority over his team\u2019s personnel decisions \u2013 proved to be a relative breeze. From Doc Rivers\u2019 hiring in that dual role by the Clippers in June 2013 to Tom Thibodeau\u2019s firing by the Timberwolves Sunday , the revival of that dubious front-office model lasted all of 67 months. That\u2019s a relative blip on Popovich\u2019s radar, given his 265 months in both jobs. In fact, if we subtract out the time that has elapsed since any coaching candidate with sufficient leverage got tabbed to do both jobs \u2013 Thibodeau was the last, in April 2016 \u2013 the hiring trend lasted a mere 34 months. Everything since then, it could be argued, has been waiting for the mistakes to clear the system. It\u2019s an approach that, if not dead, figures to be buried for the foreseeable future. Because it doesn\u2019t work. It is a relic of a league long gone, like Red Auerbach\u2019s victory cigar.  One by one, the four men who, through ambition or by circumstances, recently ended up with so much power within their basketball organizations had it stripped away. Mike Budenholzer, while in Atlanta, fell into his double duty during the 2014-15 season, after general manager Danny Ferry got put on a leave of absence over racially insensitive remarks made in a conference call with team execs. Budenholzer officially was given the title of president in June 2015 and, as a Popovich disciple after long years with the Spurs, seemed a fitting choice to juggle the roles. Twenty-three months later, though, a decline in victories from 60 (coach only) to 48 to 43 prompted Hawks owner Tony Ressler to hire Travis Schlenk as his GM. Now Budenholzer is in Milwaukee, where his coaching tactics have the Bucks near the top of the Eastern Conference but where Jon Horst is in charge of the roster. Rivers was the next to get one set of wings clipped, in August 2017 after a run in which the Clippers spun their wheels to fewer victories and quicker playoff exits. Lawrence Frank, as executive vice president, was inserted between owner Steve Ballmer and Rivers in the day-to-day operations of the basketball organization. It took Stan Van Gundy four seasons, from May 2014 to May 2018, to lose not just the clout to land both jobs but the jobs themselves. The former Orlando and Miami coach got an impressive bump in Detroit\u2019s performance and potential from Year 1 to Year 2, but the Pistons regressed from there. Now Dwane Casey is the coach and Ed Stefanski is his boss as senior advisor to owner Tom Gores. Thibodeau got axed Sunday after just two-plus seasons wearing two hats on a head designed for one. The Jimmy Butler saga disemboweled Minnesota\u2019s 2018-19 season before it even began and put Thibodeau on two hot seats at once. So when owner Glen Taylor fired him, Taylor for all practical purposes was firing the trend itself, telling the Minneapolis Star Tribune , \u201cWe\u2019re going to the traditional thing.\u201d That means interim coach Ryan Saunders will report to GM Scotty Layden \u2013 who had been hired by and ranked lower in the basketball flowchart than Thibodeau. Meanwhile, Popovich hums along as the last man standing, leaning on sidekick R.C. Buford to handle a good chunk of the personnel workload. It\u2019s worth noting here that the Timberwolves fired Thibodeau in part because they couldn\u2019t fire Butler again. Or more precisely, they couldn\u2019t get fired again by Butler, the All-Star forward who demanded a trade despite the year left on his contract, then forced his way out of Minnesota via a flurry of unprofessional behavior. Butler did himself no favors, by the way. His disruptions of the teams that have employed him \u2013 first the Bulls, then the Wolves and lately the Sixers \u2013 have crowded out what once was a laudable back story (teen from Tomball, Texas, working himself from scratch to NBA stardom). Thibodeau got little thanks for believing in Butler from his arrival in Chicago as the last pick of the 2011 first round and flipping the keys of leadership to the Wolves after trading for him in June 2017. Instead, he got a betrayal that led directly to Sunday\u2019s pink slip. Why now? The timing struck many as odd, firing Thibodeau after consecutive home victories, including a 22-point romp over the Lakers at Target Center Sunday. But Taylor, after purchasing the franchise in 1994 and hiring Kevin McHale as his first GM, learned from McHale the practice of evaluating an NBA season by breaking it into quarters. It\u2019s a practice long favored by Miami\u2019s Pat Riley, among others, and it is revealed in previous in-season Wolves coaching changes: Bill Blair fired after 20 games in 1995, Casey fired after 40 games in 2007, Randy Wittman axed after 19 in 2008 and now Thibodeau at the 40 mark. As for why, period? There has been speculation that the same demerits made against Thibodeau in Chicago \u2013 for a gruff exterior, for not always playing nice with others within his own company \u2013 were reasons. Blaming him for the team\u2019s miserable attendance (No. 29), given the Butler histrionics and 4-9 start, seems unfair, since there are actual people running the franchise\u2019s underperforming business ops. But Thibodeau holding two jobs without thriving in either \u2013 in a model that has fallen out of favor \u2013 surely did hurt him. He hitched his wagon to Butler\u2019s increasingly erratic and self-indulgent cart \u2013 and took hits for it in both capacities. As a coach, Thibodeau was criticized for seemingly allowing Butler to come and go from practice- or game-availability as he pleased. For bending to Butler\u2019s behavior, his authority in the locker room got questioned. Simultaneously, the trade that acquired Butler drew attacks in hindsight, putting POBO Thibodeau through the wringer for sending Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn to the Bulls. A separate exec could have dictated the terms of Butler\u2019s involvement during his delinquency, up to and including suspension, without feeling a coach\u2019s need for his best player \u2013 or the emotional tugs from Thibodeau\u2019s personal history with that one. A separate coach might have paid more attention to his present and future relationships with the other Wolves. What Minnesota achieved on the court under Thibodeau was good (ending a playoff drought of 14 years), though not great (the acclaimed defensive guru never got the Wolves\u2019 D spiffed up). He leaves with a 97-107 record, including 19-21 this season near the bottom of the crazy West standings . In the front office, Thibodeau probably didn\u2019t help himself with the fans with his TimberBulls project. Taj Gibson was fine and Derrick Rose has been a surprise, but Butler torpedoed everything \u2013 and the sports rivalry between the Twin Cities and Chicago had some locals resenting the dependency. Butler did come at a steep price \u2013 LaVine is averaging 23.6 points this season, more than Butler in all but one season. And Markkanen remains highly regarded as a stretch marksman. (It\u2019s not fair to criticize Thibs for including Dunn in the deal and for drafting Dunn ahead of Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray in 2016). Let\u2019s remember that it was Taylor, not Thibodeau, who looked the endlessly confounding Andrew Wiggins in the eye, Larry David-style, to see if this was a player in whom he dared to invest $147 million, via the contract extension Wiggins was gifted before last season. And once the Butler trade actually happened Nov. 10, the Wolves\u2019 return \u2013 basically Robert Covington and Dario Saric \u2013 was better than other rumored offers. Overall, though, there was too much tumult this season that made two too many jobs. There\u2019s a famous Bill Parcells quote frequently cited in defense of such dual roles: \u201cIf they want you to cook the dinner, at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries.\u201d But it\u2019s one thing to do your shopping in the relative calm of the spring and summer, prepping for the draft and wooing free agents when the schedule is empty and the team scattered. It\u2019s quite another to scramble to the store when the party already has started, the guests are in the house and everybody\u2019s hungry. The Butler fiasco hurt Thibodeau on both fronts, in both jobs. The wounds inflicted in either might not have been enough to do him in. Together, though, they proved fatal. For Thibs and for the concept. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

NBA media sources first reported the news Sunday evening, which was later confirmed through a team release . Assistant coach Ryan Saunders, son of the late Flip Saunders, will take over on an interim basis and becomes the youngest head coach in the NBA at 32 years old. General Manger Scott Layden will handle day-to-day operations of the basketball department. Thibodeau took over in Minnesota before the 2016 season following five seasons with the Chicago Bulls, where he went 255-139 and made the playoffs each season. Thibodeau finished with a 97-107 record overall in Minnesota, including a 19-21 mark this season. \u201cWe would like to thank Tom for his efforts and wish him all the best,\u201d Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor said in a statement . \u201cThese decisions are never easy to make, but we felt them necessary to move our organization forward.\u201d Christopher Hine of Minneapolis Star Tribune relayed the following additional comments from Taylor: Thibodeau returned the Wolves to the playoffs last spring after a 13-year absence. The Wolves barely reached the postseason, needing to beat the Denver Nuggets in overtime at home in the final game of the regular season , and were beaten by the Houston Rockets in five games in the first round. Prized acquisition Jimmy Butler, who played for Thibodeau in Chicago, pushed the organization into a corner when his stance that he wouldn\u2019t sign a new contract with the team became public a week before training camp began . The insistence of Thibodeau and Layden to hang on to Butler as long as possible, shrugging off the distraction, backfired. The Wolves started 4-9, and after a winless five-game road trip, the awkwardness was too much for even Thibodeau and Layden to ignore. Butler was sent to the Philadelphia 76ers in a package that brought Robert Covington and Dario Saric, two promising players who\u2019ve fit relatively well in the rotation. The Wolves are only 15-12 since the Butler deal, though, in a Western Conference that is as stacked as ever. With Taylor\u2019s commitment to maximum-salary contracts for both Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, there\u2019s no more room for patience with a franchise that has had to start over so many times since Kevin Garnett led the Wolves to the Western Conference finals in 2004 . Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Thibodeau wasn\u2019t expecting the news , and another former Bulls coach, Fred Hoiberg \u2014 who succeeded Thibodeau and was let go earlier this season \u2014 is under consideration for a front office role, though not a combined one . Wojnarowski also reports that former Pelicans coach and current 76ers assistant coach Monty Williams could be in the mix , along with former NBA Finals MVP and current ESPN analyst Chauncey Billups . Taylor told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Saunders will have every chance to win the coaching job for good. Saunders played four seasons at the University of Minnesota and was an assistant coach there before spending five seasons as an assistant coach with the Washington Wizards. \u201cMy hope would be that Ryan takes over and we play well or good enough to get into the playoffs and do well there and that Ryan would earn to be the permanent coach,\u201d Taylor told the newspaper. \u201cThat would be my hope.\u201d In regards to Layden\u2019s status, Taylor told the Minneapolis Star Tribune : \u201cHe\u2019s under contract and he\u2019ll be in charge. He\u2019ll still be the GM, but we\u2019re going to the traditional thing. We won\u2019t have a basketball president or the coach to do both.

When nine of Wednesday\u2019s 10 games are complete, the league will have played 615 of 1,230. It seems like we just passed the quarter mark of the season and it\u2019s not clear that anything has been sorted out since then. Though things are starting to get desperate for a few of them, there are still 14 teams with a chance to reach the postseason in the Western Conference, where the Golden State Warriors continue to tread water (relative to expectations). In the East, five teams have clearly separated themselves from the pack. But in the 20 games played between them, each of those five teams has at least three losses. No team has clearly established itself as the clear best team in the league. The Milwaukee Bucks have the league\u2019s best pace-adjusted point differential by a wide margin , but have played the league\u2019s most home-heavy schedule in a season with a higher winning percentage for home teams (.600) than usual (.593 over the last 10 full seasons). The Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs have made big runs over the last month, but both started those runs from 14th place in the West and, if the playoffs started today, neither would be hosting a first-round playoff series. The three longest winning streaks in the league this season have been just eight games long, and the most recent of those \u2014 that of the Boston Celtics, who were .500 when the streak started \u2014 ended 3 1\/2 weeks ago. There have been 89 games (less than six per team) played since Christmas and every team has at least one loss over those 12 days . With the trade deadline exactly one month away ( Feb. 7 ), parity continues to be the story of the 2018-19 season. For now, the Denver Nuggets are at the top of the rankings, with a five-game winning streak that began with a win over the No. 2 Spurs.

It\u2019s been that way for the Indiana Pacers\u2019 big man from the first moment he picked up a basketball. He wasn\u2019t the best right away, but his work ethic always carried him through. That\u2019s why he entered his fourth season in the NBA on a different trajectory with an upstart Pacers team navigating a slow grind of their own in the Eastern Conference standings. The Pacers weren\u2019t anyone\u2019s preseason pick to crash the party at the top of the East. And yet here they are, right in the thick of things along with the Toronto Raptors, Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. T urner has been a steady presence for the Pacers, a force protecting the rim (he\u2019s averaging a career-best 2.8 blocks per game ) as well as a dynamic offensive performer capable of impacting the game both inside and from deep (making a career-best 39.1 percent of his 3-pointers ). He\u2019s evolved into the prototype stretch-five in this position-less era of the game and it is why he was one of the youngest players at USA Basketball\u2019s mini-camp last summer with the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team. It was there that Turner got a taste of what life could be like in future summers spent competing in World Cup and Olympic competitions with the best players in the game. It\u2019s a peer group every player in the league is eager to join \u2014 even a humble, slow-grinder like Turner. Turner, who sat out of the Pacers\u2019 Sunday road loss to the Raptors with a sore shoulder, spoke with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith about all that and more recently. * * * Sekou Smith:  Has this season gone the way you expected it to based on the work you did in the offseason? I was out there in Las Vegas for the USA Baskeball mini-camp and saw how much extra attention you were getting from some of the vets. It seemed like everybody was anticipating this being sort of a take-off year for you. Myles Turner:  The way I\u2019m looking at it, I\u2019m just trying to get better every year and help my team win. It\u2019s as simple as that. And I think we\u2019re doing a solid job so far. It\u2019s not about me individually. I mean, I have my own goals in terms of where I want to be and where I want to see my game go long-term. But all of my goals right now are about this team and what we can do this season. SS:  Well, not a lot of people outside of Indiana picked the Pacers to be in this space. Is this Pacers team where you thought you\u2019d be coming out of Christmas and heading into the 2019 part of the season? MT:  Like I said, I think we\u2019re doing a solid job. There\u2019s no doubt there are few games we wish we could have back, same as any season. But we\u2019re doing a solid job right now. I really like where our defense is at and I think our chemistry overall is really good. We know who we are and what we\u2019re capable of and we do our best to play to our highest level every night out. SS:  You had a monster December (15.7 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 3.2 bpg on 53.5 percent shooting and 50 percent 3-point shooting), when [All-Star guard Victor] Oladipo was out of the lineup for the first five games of that month. Does everything just feel different when you know you\u2019re rolling like that? MT:  You\u2019re so busy grinding during course of the season that it\u2019s hard to get too deep into your own mind about how you\u2019re playing, good or bad. I don\u2019t like to dive too deep into it either way, dwelling on things. You have to get out there every night and do your job and then move on to the next one and do it again. SS:  What does it say about this team that during that 11-game stretch when Victor was out of the lineup that you guys went 7-4 and maintained the way you did? MT:  It just shows that we have a lot of resiliency on this team and a lot of depth. We\u2019ve got a lot of guys that could step up at any given moment. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re built as a group and that\u2019s what Coach [Nate] McMillan expects of us. We\u2019re all grown men and we understand the responsibility we all carry on this team. It\u2019s never about just one of us. It\u2019s about what we do as a group.  SS:  There are still levels that each player is chasing each and every year. Here you are in your fourth season. Has your approach changed now as a \u201cveteran?\u201d Is it more strategic compared to the way you approached things as a youngster just coming into the league and trying to just work your tail off to create some space and establish yourself? MT:  Well kind of, man. It\u2019s kind of like that. But I still have that worker mentality. And I\u2019m still one of the younger players on this team, I\u2019m 22, so even though I have more of a leadership role now, I\u2019m still one of the younger guys. So it\u2019s always about trying to get my work in as much as possible \u2026 you know, I don\u2019t really feels the aches and pains like some of the older vets do [laughing]. But ultimately, I just try and work. I don\u2019t think anything can ever replace that. SS:  Speaking of that work, I watched the way you guys worked after the sessions in Vegas. You, Devin Booker, Victor, Paul George and Kevin Durant were going at it one-on-one. It was some physically intense stuff after the big group workouts, which was no joke. Is that just more of that grind you\u2019re talking about?  MT:  It\u2019s just an elite-level, and uh, where I want to be one day. I know I\u2019m still working to get there. But I still feel like I can hold my own against that company. So, going up against that caliber of competition on a daily basis, in that setting, hopefully it just helps me take my game to that next level of where I want to be. SS:  Did that setting also give you a chance to see what sorts of things you could steal \u2014 and I mean that in a good way \u2014 from some of the league\u2019s elite players? MT:  Yeah, I know what you mean. And yeah, I watch film just like anybody else. So, if I see something that I like, I might work on it here and there. But for the most part, I have my own refined game and that\u2019s really all I can rely on at the end of the day. SS:  The change in the game seems like it really works in favor of guys like you, big men who can stretch out on the floor and play all over. Everybody wants a big man who can play basically like a man half his size. Does that make sense to you being a 7-footer and the size of a traditional big man but growing up in an era where you\u2019re encouraged to develop all these other skills? MT: Oh yeah, definitely. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done all of my life. I\u2019ve always been able to shoot and handle the ball. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked on from a young age. My dad really put me on to it. He told me, \u201cone of these days, bigs are going to have to do everything.\u201d And lo and behold, he was right. It plays right into my hands, so there is no negative connotation to it for me. I know there might have been a time before me where you had big men who were conflicted about how to deal with developing their game and choosing one way or the other. But not for me, and not for any of the bigs of my generation. If you look around the league and at the game around the world, we\u2019re all seeing the same things. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

James Harden torched the Grizzlies for 43 points and racked up his eighth straight game with 35 or more points. In doing so, he added another record to his burgeoning NBA legacy, as he passed Oscar Robertson (who had two seven-game streaks of scoring 35 or more points). Spurs 120, Celtics 111 \u2014 Somewhere, David Robinson, Sean Elliott and others from the 1993 Spurs squad might be feeling wistful. San Antonio made 19 of 25 shots (76 percent) in the third quarter and finished with its best period since 1993 to power a killer comeback win against Boston. With the victory, the Spurs won for the 11th time in their last 13 games. Thunder 107, Lakers 100 \u2014 Boo him all you want, Lakers fans. Paul George didn\u2019t hear much of those jeers on Wednesday night as he returned to L.A. (and the city he spurned in free agency) to put on a show before his hometown squad. George came up big time and again to drop the LeBron-less Lakers and leave them smarting for two separate reasons. Spurs 125, Raptors 107 \u2014 Kawhi Leonard was adored by San Antonio\u2019s faithful as he spent his first seven seasons with the Spurs. In his return to Texas on Thursday, it was a markedly different showing of emotion. Leonard heard chants of \u201cTraitor!\u201d and \u201cQuitter!\u201d at times throughout the game as the Spurs built a big lead and never looked back to drop the Raptors. Rockets 135, Warriors 134 (OT) \u2014 A 44-point game? Check. Back-to-back triple-doubles? Check. Game-winning 3-pointer against a hated Western Conference rival? Check. James Harden nailed all the boxes a Houston fan could hope for in delivering perhaps the season\u2019s most dazzling single-game showing to date. If you somehow missed this classic on Thursday night, fire up your NBA League Pass and give it a second watch (and a third, and a fourth \u2026) Pacers 119, Bulls 116 (OT) \u2014 Chicago guard Zach LaVine has yet to fully realize all his star potential like his Indiana cohort, Victor Oladipo, has. But you couldn\u2019t tell that on Friday night as the pair of two guards showed off their go-to guy wares in the fourth quarter and overtime at United Center. LaVine was magical down the stretch in the fourth quarter, but it was Oladipo who had the last laugh with a banked-in 3-pointer with :00.3 left in overtime. Raptors 123, Bucks 116 \u2014 The Raptors have spent the better part of the season asserting themselves as the best team in the East. They made that much clear again on Saturday \u2014 just days after a blowout loss in San Antonio left them smarting. Kawhi Leonard ran wild for 30 points and Toronto overcame an epic game from Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo (43 points, 18 rebounds) to grab a key road victory. Warriors 127, Kings 123 \u2014 Here\u2019s a challenge for you: find a 3-point record the Warriors aren\u2019t a part of yet. Golden State and Sacramento combined to nail 41 3-pointers, marking the first game in which both teams made 20 3-pointers. In addition, Stephen Curry passed Utah Jazz guard Kyle Korver for fourth on the all-time 3-pointers made list (and is just three from tying Jason Terry for third place). Raptors 121, Pacers 105 \u2014 Aside from the loss to the Spurs, this week couldn\u2019t have gone much better for the Raptors. Even with Kawhi Leonard taking a rest day, Toronto used its balanced lineup (and the return of Kyle Lowry) to get another key win against another top team in the East. James Harden (43 points, 8-19 FG, 10 reb, 13 ast in 38 minutes) \u2014 Since Dec. 1, Harden has been held under 30 points three times in 17 games. That\u2019s an amazing run in and of itself. Yet, he topped that on Monday with his showing vs. Memphis, which allowed him to set an NBA record for most consecutive 35-point games (eight) that was up to double-digits by week\u2019s end. | Watch | Video box score Jusuf Nurkic (24 points, 23 rebounds, 7 ast, 5 stl, 5 blk in 38 minutes) \u2014 Each category in this stat line Nurkic notched is nothing out of the ordinary for him. But, him putting it all together for a monster 20-20 \u201c5\u00d75\u201d game was \u2014 and it was historic, too. Per Elias Sports Bureau, he\u2019s the only player to log a 20-20 \u201c5\u00d75\u201d on the Kings and the first to notch such a game since Anthony Davis on Nov. 21. | Watch | Video box score Paul George (37 points, 15-29 FG, 4 reb, 2 ast, 4 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 OKC\u2019s versatile swingman is making a serious push not only for an All-Star spot, but a place in the Kia MVP conversation. That much was made clear with the go-to-guy goodness he showed all game long on Wednesday night at Staples Center. | Watch | Video box score DeMar DeRozan (21 points, 7-15 FG, 14 reb, 11 ast, 2 stl in 33 minutes) \u2014 Much of the talk on Thursday centered on Kawhi Leonard\u2019s return to face his old team. But DeRozan had an ax to grind, too, with his old squad for trading him last summer. His all-around play powered San Antonio\u2019s rout from the opening tip as he logged the first triple-double of his standout career Thursday. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (44 points, 13-32 FG, 10 reb, 15 ast, 2 blk in 44 minutes) \u2014 Scoring a point-per-minute with the defense totally keyed in on you \u2014 as Golden State\u2019s was on Thursday \u2014 is crazy. Doing that and nailing the game-winning 3-pointer over a pair of defenders? That\u2019s what makes Harden one of the must-watch scorers in the NBA today. | Watch | Video box score Giannis Antetokounmpo (43 points, 16-25 FG, 18 reb, 4 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 Games like this show why Antetokounmpo shouldn\u2019t be discounted in the Kia MVP chase. Yes, Harden\u2019s run of late has been dazzling. But Antetokounmpo\u2019s play Saturday was the only thing keeping Milwaukee in a game it would eventually lose to the East-leading Toronto Raptors. Watch | Video box score Golden State Warriors (21-47 3pt FG) and Sacramento Kings (20-36 3pt FG) \u2014 We could spotlight Stephen Curry from this game (10-20 3pt FG). Or we could focus on the night Buddy Hield had from deep (8-13 3pt FG). But instead, let\u2019s accentuate the amazing shooting from deep both teams turned in Saturday night in Sacramento. Watch | Video box score \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get any better than what he\u2019s playing. Defensively, too. He comes up with steals, triple-doubles like it\u2019s nothing. So yeah, he\u2019s playing at a different level.\u201d \u2014 Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni , on James Harden after win Monday vs. Grizzlies \u201cI\u2019ve learned that he\u2019s going to make some of them. \u2018There are times when I\u2019m like `What is he doing?\u2019 Then they go in and I sit back down.\u201d \u2014 Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer , on Brook Lopez \u201cI think we played with them too much. We were playing around with them too much. The energy wasn\u2019t there. Guys were ready to go home.\u201d \u2014 Sixers guard Ben Simmons , after a close win vs. Phoenix on Wednesday The whole first half, they did whatever they wanted \u2026 we weren\u2019t physical, weren\u2019t talking. They got a lot of layups, a lot of open 3s. They shot the ball extremely well in the first half due to our lazy defense.\u201d \u2014 Pelicans center Anthony Davis \u201cThe booing wasn\u2019t going to throw me off my game. I\u2019ve been playing basketball for a really long time. A little booing and a little noise wasn\u2019t going to make me forget how to play basketball.\u201d \u2014 Thunder forward Paul George , after a road win vs. the Lakers \u201cKawhi\u2019s a high-character guy. We all make decisions in our lives about what we\u2019re going to do with our futures and he has that same right as any of us. So, I felt badly, honestly.\u201d \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich , after San Antonio fans booed Leonard often on Thursday \u201cIt\u2019s a fun way to play, especially when you\u2019re shooting a high percentage. You can shoot as many 3s as you want to but shooting a high percentage the way it was tonight on both ends was pretty crazy.\u201d \u2014 Warriors guard Stephen Curry , after Saturday\u2019s 3-point bonanza \u201c(Oladipo) is our star. Before overtime started, I pulled him aside and said, `It\u2019s time to take us to the promised land.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Pacers forward Thaddeus Young , after Friday\u2019s win vs. Chicago \u201cI always said Kemba is one of the most underrated players in the league, even with making a couple of All-Stars.

McCaw \u2014 who was an unsigned, restricted free agent to start the season \u2014 officially joined the Cavaliers on Dec. 28 after the Golden State Warriors declined to match Cleveland\u2019s two-year, non-guaranteed offer. NBA teams were available to sign players to 10-day deals starting on Saturday and the Cavs did so on Sunday, adding former Chicago Bulls and Oklahoma City Thunder guard Cameron Payne. Payne played in 31 games (12 starts) for the Bulls this season, averaging 5.7 points and 2.7 assists in 17.3 minutes per game. Over his NBA career, the fourth-year guard has appeared in 144 games with Chicago and Oklahoma City, averaging 5.8 points and 2.5 assists per game. If McCaw clears waivers, he would become an unrestricted free agent with the ability to sign with any team in the league. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports the third-year guard is expected to receive interest from \u201cseveral playoff contenders\u201d. McCaw played in three games for Cleveland with averages of 1.7 points in 17.6 minutes.

Sunday evening, in the hours after Minnesota\u2019s thorough 108-86 dismantling of the Los Angeles Lakers, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania posted this: From there, it was a high-volume race through tight Twitter corners, with Woj, Jon Krawczynski, K.C. Johnson, Christopher Hines and others each breaking bits to advance the story before (blessedly) official confirmation dropped via team release at 8:36 p.m. ET. \u201cWe would like to thank Tom for his efforts and wish him all the best,\u201d said Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor in a team statement . \u201cThese decisions are never easy to make, but we felt them necessary to move our organization forward\u201d The Wolves choose to do so after two-plus seasons under Thibodeau, who held dual titles as head coach (97-107 overall, with the first playoff appearance in 13 seasons) and president of basketball operations. It was in the latter role that the whole, ah \u2026 TimberBulls maelstrom collapsed upon itself like so many black holes in the wake of Jimmy Butler\u2019s arrival and subsequent trade (demand). At 19-21, and 15-12 since the trade, the Wolves sit 11th in the West, just two games back of the eight-place Lakers and four behind fifth-place Houston. Taylor and the remaining team brass sensed that a postseason return could be in the offing, and clearly didn\u2019t think Thibodeau was the one to get them there. It\u2019ll be on the well-regarded 32-year-old shoulders of Ryan Saunders, son of late franchise icon Flip Saunders, to lead that push. At the very least, it has to be comforting to know he\u2019s rolling out Karl-Anthony Towns (28 points, 18 rebounds, three assists, two steals and four blocks on Sunday) to crush any challengers: The Wizards waltzed into Oklahoma City and cracked a heretofore untainted code, earning their first victory in nine attempts there. Key to the win was Otto Porter, who hit 20 points for only the third time this injury-plagued season. Sure, it took 17 shots, but the action\u2019s in the attempts, says one teammate: Going to be interesting to see if Porter can keep that up as we move forward. He\u2019ll need to if the Wizards are to hang without John Wall. Kyle Lowry stepped between the lines after missing 10 of the past 11 games with a sore lower back, putting up 12 points and eight assists to lead eight Raptors in double figures. A true team victory, which should come as no surprise given the way they\u2019ve played this season on the way to the league\u2019s best record: #OneLastDance? More like #OneLastReminder that Dwyane Wade\u2019s basketball instincts remain sharp, amiright? No takers? Whatever, watch this pass: Kemba Walker\u2019s been doing everything he can to keep the Charlotte Hornets in playoff contention, and wrapped a bow on a 119-113 victory that was closer than the final line appeared. With a Kelly Oubre Jr. dunk pulling the Suns within two just four seconds from the finish, Walker managed to snag the inbounds while pulling away from the defense and heading toward his own bucket.

Wallace issued his statement just hours after ESPN.com reported that the Grizzlies and Parsons had agreed to a split, with Parsons leaving Memphis while his agent, James Dunleavy, and the team negotiate an end to his contract. The Grizzlies GM says they met with Parsons and spoke with both the forward and his representation numerous times during the forward\u2019s rehab on how to \u201cintegrate a healthy and effective Chandler\u201d back on the court. \u201cIn the last of these conversations, we presented Chandler clear options for him and his representatives to choose, which included a short three-home-game stint for the Memphis Hustle or rehab either in Memphis or in Los Angeles with the training team of his choice,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cChandler subsequently chose to continue his rehab in Los Angeles.\u201d Parsons has played three games in the third season of the four-year, $94 million contract he signed in July 2016. Limited by injuries, he played a combined 70 games over the first two seasons of that contract, but Dunleavy told The Commercial Appeal on Dec. 28 that Parsons had been cleared and was ready to play. Dunleavy did not immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Sunday night. Parsons was the Grizzlies\u2019 big free agent signee in July 2016, with Memphis believing it finally had the 3-point threat the team has lacked for years. Parsons has been nothing but a disappointment with injury after injury. Before signing with Memphis, Parsons had never played fewer than 61 games in a season in the NBA with stints in Houston and Dallas. At media day in September, Parsons said he thought his knee issues were past him after playing with no limitations during the summer. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the last two years have gone horribly and not the way I planned, but the reasons why I came to Memphis are still all intact,\u201d Parsons said then. Parsons last played for Memphis on Oct. 22, going scoreless in just over six minutes in a win at Utah. Now the Grizzlies have lost five straight and are 2-8 over their last 10 games. They have dropped to 12th in the Western Conference after sitting atop the West at 12-5 in late November. It\u2019s been a busy few days for the Grizzlies. Wallace apologized Thursday for an apparent altercation in the locker room between Garrett Temple and Omri Casspi after a loss to Detroit the night before. Hours later, the Grizzlies traded for guard Justin Holiday , sending guards MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden Jr. along with second-round picks in 2019 and 2020 in the deal."},{"id":46643,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-5-19-2","date":"2019-01-06","title":"About Last Night: Warriors, Kings make it rain","content":"It\u2019s a new NBA. Shooting is the most valuable skill. Three is greater than two. Those are the basic principles behind the era of pace-and-space basketball, a world in which the Warriors have been king for roughly half a decade. Golden State and Sacramento took that long-distance philosophy to record-breaking horizons on Saturday, combining for an NBA record 41 made 3-pointers (21 for the Warriors, 20 for the Kings) in the defending champs\u2019 127-123 victory . Stephen Curry accounted for nearly one-quarter of those treys, sinking 10 of a career-high 20 attempts, including this jab-step gem that absolutely paralyzed the Kings\u2019 defense. Just as impressive was the Kings\u2019 ability to keep pace until the final buzzer. Buddy Hield, who has quietly become one of the best outside shooters in the league, hit 8 triples en route to 32 points. Justin Jackson added five 3s off the bench, but admitted after the game he was hurting from the aforementioned Curry shake. Both teams needed the win, albeit for different reasons. The Warriors remain 1.5 games behind Denver for first in the West, while the Kings\u2019 fourth straight loss drops them to 10th, just one game ahead of Memphis, Dallas and Minnesota. It\u2019s been a rough year for the once-darling Jazz. Since last season\u2019s second-half rampage and run to the Western Conference semifinals, Utah has floundered under an anemic offense and a bottom-five turnover rate. Donovan Mitchell has suffered the brunt of outside question marks after many assumed he would make a second-year leap instead of hitting a sophomore slump. The former No. 13 overall picks\u2019s shooting numbers are all down, leaving Utah scrambling for points they could ill afford to lose. Christmas might have brought Utah the gift of optimism. Since Dec. 25 , Utah ranks top-10 in both offense and turnover rate while maintaining a top-five defense. Mitchell\u2019s efficiency is up , his own miscues down. The Jazz have won six of their last nine, with Saturday\u2019s win over Detroit pushing them to .500 for the first time since Dec. 6. Most importantly, Mitchell looks like the late-game killer who stormed the league last season. The Jazz guard nailed the game-clinching jumper with 22 seconds remaining \u2014 then either imparted a parting shot to an opponent or credit to a fan. Mitchell appeared to say, \u201cYou did it. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d While Curry was setting records with his 3-point attempts, one of them was ultimately negated by traveling. The two-time Kia MVP didn\u2019t agree with the call, which arrived after a double-step-back move to make space. If the sequence looks familiar, that\u2019s because it Rockets star guard James Harden pulled it off less than three weeks ago . Curry clearly felt the move must be allowed only to Harden, as he mockingly held a No. 13 in front of his jersey to plead precedent. He didn\u2019t stop there. After the game Curry told reporters that the officials \u201cknew it was somebody different, so they called it.\u201d It\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a plane! No, it\u2019s 7-foot, 250-pound Serbian center Nikola Jokic! Denver\u2019s excitement over their airborne big man is understandable. Saturday\u2019s jam was just his fifth of the year. Jokic\u2019s 39 points, 12 rebounds and six assists were pretty good , too. Speaking of birds, a pigeon decided to steal some camera time during the Spurs\u2019 108-88 rout over the Grizzlies: Unfortunately for San Antonio, Manu Ginobili wasn\u2019t around to recreate his trademark bat swat. More Spurs flashbacks, this time courtesy of LaMarcus Aldridge. The six-time All-Star has averaged fewer than two assists per game over his career, but the Spurs big man turned in a beauty against the Grizzlies. This dish got us wondering whether Aldridge had spent any time with a certain Laker legend\u2026 No Mavs fan wants to see his\/her prized rookie go down in a heap, but man, can we have a moment of silence for the poor camerman? The 19-year-old immediately checked on the team employee during the next break in play, which isn\u2019t surprising. This is the same guy who, earlier this season, consoled a 10-year-old fan he\u2019d similarly bulldozed with his game-worn jersey."},{"id":36528,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-kings-combine-nba-record-41-3-pointers","date":"2019-01-06","title":"Warriors, Kings combine for record 41 3-pointers","content":"The Warriors and Kings made long-range NBA history Saturday night.

A report published on Friday said that Butler recently challenged Brown in a disrespectful way and wants to be utilized differently in the coach\u2019s offensive scheme. Brown dismissed the report before Saturday\u2019s game against the Dallas Mavericks. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like any of that crossed the line,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s vocal.

Brown said that he would like to accommodate Butler\u2019s request as much as he can without completely altering his system and what he thinks will work for the 76ers\u2019 other stars. \u201cThe team part of this is my true north,\u201d he said.

Kanter will stay in New York while the Knicks travel to face Washington at The O2 arena in London on Jan. 17. He says he can\u2019t travel anywhere except the U.S. and Canada because \u201cthere\u2019s a chance I could get killed out there.\u201d \u201cSadly, I\u2019m not going because of that freaking lunatic, the Turkish president,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that all the stuff affects my career and basketball, because I want to be out there and help my team win.

That\u2019s one of the games you dream about. It just turned out great for us.\u201d Such was Victor Oladipo\u2019s summation of the Pacers\u2019 119-116 overtime triumph over the Bulls. The contest won\u2019t grab national attention like the Rockets\u2019 OT victory in Golden State on Thursday, nor did it feature a singularly remarkable shot like James Harden\u2019s game-winning 3 . But what it lacked in star power and play-of-the-year ridiculousness, Friday\u2019s battle in Chicago more than countered with quality and quantity. Buckle up for a truly wild five-plus minutes of NBA hoops. The sequence tipped off with Zach LaVine\u2019s clutch, off-the-dribble 3 to tie the game with 3.9 seconds left in regulation. That led to an overtime period featuring seven ties or lead changes, highlighted by a bravura stretch of shot-making in the final minute: Incredibly, the game that didn\u2019t want to end gave us one last bucket \u2026 except it didn\u2019t count, as yet another clutch 3 from LaVine came juuuuuust after the final buzzer sounded. We\u2019d also be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention Kris Dunn\u2019s complete destruction of Turner just a few possessions before the final flurry began with one of the best individual plays of the night. Add it all up, and you have a truly exceptional contest that none of the participants or observers will forget any time soon. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a shot,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said of Oladipo\u2019s winner. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he called bank, but I\u2019ll take it. You have to make shots, and both teams did. A hell of a game.\u201d Programming Note: Pacers vs. Bulls re-airs on NBA TV at 5:00 p.m. tonight. They love the NBA in Boston, as proven once again by their show of appreciation for Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki in what might have been his final appearance at TD Garden. It continued through the end of the game, with the Boston faithful urging Nowitzki to shoot every time he touched the ball during mop-up duty in the Celtics\u2019 114-93 triumph . Alas, the Big German missed all 10 shots he took, the most attempts he\u2019s ever had without making any in his 21-year career, and did not score for just the ninth time in 1,481 games. That put only the slightest of dampers of what was otherwise another wonderful tribute for one of the greatest and most well-liked players in league history.  \u201cDirk, that\u2019s the legend man,\u201d said Celtics swingman Jaylen Brown. \u201cWhen he steps away from the game, it\u2019s definitely going to be a sad day.\u201d Said Nowitzki, \u201cSuper sweet, super emotional. It\u2019s sweet when, not only your home fans but fans on the road appreciate what you have done the last two decades. I appreciate the fans of Boston and unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t even make one. I definitely will never forget the reception.\u201d As is wont to happen every once in a while, the lights shut off in the middle of Friday\u2019s game between the Bucks and the Hawks. Only this time, Atlanta veteran Vince Carter knew why. \u201c(Carter) was getting my attention and I was like, \u2018What do you want, Vince?\u2019 Bucks center Jason Smith said, as quoted by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel . \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Bro, you shot the lights out!\u2019\u201d Indeed, the Bucks went off for 43 points in the first quarter, and proceeded to build on their lead from there as Fiserv Forum went dark in the second. Unfortunately for the Hawks, it was only a temporary reprieve as the deficit ballooned as high as 46. Fun side note: Per Elias Sports, the Bucks became the first team in NBA history to have 12 players \u2014 12!!! \u2014 score eight points or more. Wizards guard Bradley Beal is a great player in his own right. Yet when it came time to greet the retiring Dwyane Wade after the Heat\u2019s 115-109 victory , he was reduced to a grade school kid mustering up the courage to approach his favorite player despite having shared the court across seven NBA seasons. \u201cI\u2019ve always had it in my mind to ask him (for his jersey),\u201d Beal said. \u201cI\u2019m always kind of nervous because I don\u2019t want to get shot down.\u201d Beal needn\u2019t have worried. Wade, as has become custom throughout his farewell season, was only too happy to swap tops. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the reason I wear No. 3,\u201d Beal said. \u201cFor the first time, I told him tonight. I almost lost my mind when he gave it to me. You try not to be a fan, but I am. He\u2019s a legend. I called him my idol and I thanked him. I learned a lot, how he carries himself. He\u2019s not cocky with it. He does it in a humble way. I have nothing but respect for him, his game and his legacy.\u201d Life comes at you fast in the NBA, as the Lakers are learning the hard way. It was roughly a month ago that they were sitting at 17-10 and seemingly gelling around LeBron James. Fast forward to present day, where the injured James is at least a week from return and the Lakers have lost 7 of their last 11, including 119-112 at home to a Knicks squad that entered with only nine wins and had dropped eight straight. Down 17 early on, the Lakers rallied to lead by six entering the fourth quarter and looked on their way to righting the ship. They promptly imploded down the stretch, including a rare 5-second violation on a critical late possession as the Knicks outscored them by 13 over the final 12 minutes. \u201cOnce shots didn\u2019t go in, guys start trying to do it one their own and that\u2019s not a recipe for us to win,\u201d Lakers coach Luke Walton said. Said Lonzo Ball, who combined with Brandon Ingram to commit 11 turnovers, \u201cWe keep losing the same. We get up in the fourth and we keep giving it away.\u201d It\u2019s an old coaching adage to take shots in games that you\u2019ve actually worked on in practice. It\u2019s yet another aspect of the game that precocious Mavericks rookie Luka Doncic has down cold. Witness the following sequence from Boston\u2026 Pregame: Real game: Obviously a bit closer, with actual defensive pressure provided by Celtics pest Marcus Smart, but the overarching principle remains the same.

It meant a lot. When he said it, I thanked him and I hope I was good enough role model for him.\u201d Wade left Miami for basically 1 1\/2 of his 16 NBA seasons, playing a year in Chicago before starting last season in Cleveland. Beal still considers him a Heat lifer, and indicated that he would like to follow along a similar path. \u201cHe paved the way for me,\u201d Beal said. \u201cHe paved the way for a lot of us in today\u2019s game and to see his hard work and to play as long as he did in one organization \u2026 he meant everything to this city and this team.

James Harden, the reigning MVP , doesn\u2019t want to give up the title, however. He\u2019s been playing like it, as the Houston Rockets have taken off over the past three weeks with Harden leading the way. Meanwhile, Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 the upstart in this season\u2019s MVP chase \u2014 is authoring a rather compelling case of his own in Milwaukee. Maybe that MVP challenge from Kobe Bryant in 2017 is still on his mind these days. And we didn\u2019t mention the other legit MVP candidates \u2014 Kawhi Leonard in Toronto, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant in Oakland, Joel Embiid in Philadelphia \u2014 who are sure to keep this debate rolling as the 2018-19 season rolls on. There\u2019s something refreshing about everyone making their intentions known. Perhaps it\u2019s the start of a New Year and the accompanying resolution season that has everyone so willing to make their ambitions clear and (perhaps more importantly) public. Clearly, storylines abound as the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder says goodbye to 2018 as the collective focus turns to whatever lies ahead this year. No one is charging like Harden, who\u2019s been a one-man force of nature all while Chris Paul nurses the sore hamstring he injured before Christmas . The idea of him finishing this season with back-to-back Maurice Podoloff trophies seemed laughable on Dec. 11. Back then, the Rockets were in 14th place in the Western Conference . Since then, they\u2019ve won 11 of 12 and six straight with Harden on a historic scoring run . You saw the show he put on at Oracle Arena last night . (And if you didn\u2019t, you missed the performance and game of the New Year).

The game-winning 3-pointer with 1 second left was just the latest masterstroke of an absolutely jaw-dropping run from the reigning MVP. It\u2019s clear he has his mind on keeping the hardware in his possession for a second straight season. What\u2019s more impressive, though: that Harden has scored 30 or more points in 11 straight games? Or the circumstances (no Chris Paul) in which he\u2019s performing these heroics for a Rockets team that looked lost weeks ago? Harden\u2019s refusal to let this season slip away after an 11-14 start has been the fuel coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s team needed to get back into contention in the Western Conference \u2014 a place where the mighty Warriors don\u2019t look so invincible.  Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 1.6 blocks, 1.4 steals Antetokounmpo\u2019s all-out assault on the Eastern Conference, and really the entire league, shows no sign of slowing down. His Bucks have won four straight and eight of nine heading into tonight\u2019s game against the Atlanta Hawks ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Were it not for Harden\u2019s recent near-nuclear run, \u201cthe Greek Freak\u201d would have started 2019 the same way he finished the past one \u2014 sitting atop this list. The appreciation for what he\u2019s doing for the Bucks was reflected in the first All-Star ballot returns as he\u2019s leading all Eastern Conference players in votes. That puts him on track to serve as one of the captains for next month\u2019s superstar showcase in Charlotte . What the Bucks need is for Antetokounmpo to stay healthy and focused as the season wanes. The No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference is well within the reach for his Bucks. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  28.9 points, 5.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.3 steals It\u2019s not often that a 35-point night from a former back-to-back MVP winner gets overshadowed the way Curry\u2019s did Thursday (thanks, Harden). Curry didn\u2019t shoot anywhere close to his usual 45 percent (he was 5-for-15 from deep) against the Rockets, but certainly played well enough to win a game the Warriors led by 20 points. The real concern for Curry and the Warriors is that the switch they are used to flipping in rough times doesn\u2019t appear to be working. They don\u2019t lose the way they did to the Rockets with a near-healthy roster ( DeMarcus Cousins is practicing and nearing his debut) and with Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green all on track. It\u2019s not like you can ask for more from Curry if you\u2019re coach Steve Kerr. But that won\u2019t stop Curry from examining his own recent performance (he is shooting just 41.6 percent overall in his last 10 games) and tweaking some things. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.1 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.6 steals Leonard\u2019s first trip back to San Antonio since forcing his way out of town was the boo-fest you might have expected. There was a nasty reception from the crowd as the Raptors got rolled by the Spurs. (And DeMar DeRozan, who was traded to San Antonio for Leonard last July, got a triple-double vs. his old team ). Leonard finished with 21 points, a sharp drop off from the career-best 45-point game he logged agaisnt Utah two days prior. Still, you could almost excuse his struggles given the emotions swirling about as he played as a visitor at AT&T Center for the first time. Whatever bad feelings may linger among the Spurs\u2019 faithful, it appears that Leonard and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich have moved on from it all . After the game, they embraced and spent some time in a pointed discussion. The conversation for the Raptors, of course, turns to the health of All-Star guard Kyle Lowry. He and Leonard are still working on the chemistry that will carry this team come playoff time, which is what matters most for Toronto. Last week:  No. 6 Season stats:  26.7 points, 8.1 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.3 steals Lost in the hype surrounding his return to his beloved Southern California on Wednesday was the fact that George, and not Russell Westbrook, has become the Thunder\u2019s true alpha male. All the browbeating of George\u2019s decision to re-sign with OKC last summer revolved around a narrative that he was willing to be the \u201cRobin\u201d to Westbrook\u2019s \u201cBatman.\u201d But that\u2019s clearly not the way things are playing out this season for the Thunder\u2019s two biggest stars. George has been nothing short of brilliant this season and of late (33 points on 48.8 percent shooting, 8.9 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.3 steals in his last 10 games). That has not only put him in the All-NBA mix , but also made him a legit MVP contender for the first time in his career. And, George has the Thunder positioned to push for the top spot in the West. That\u2019s a place no one saw them being after their 0-4 start was marked by Westbrook\u2019s injury and shaky team chemistry. * * * 6. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  7.

A new debate may just be starting, though, after last night\u2019s thrilling overtime clash between the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors. If you somehow missed it, the Rockets topped the Warriors 135-134 behind the scoring heroics of Houston\u2019s James Harden. It was another mesmerizing performance by the reigning Kia MVP , as he had 44 points, 10 rebounds and 15 assists and a must-see game-winning 3-pointer in OT. Overall, Harden is averaging 40.1 points, 9.0 assists and 6.6 rebounds over his last 12 games (and Houston is 11-1 during that span). After the game, Rockets GM Daryl Morey told ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon that Harden could be considered one of the best pure offensive threats the game has ever known. \u201cYou could argue for him as the best offensive player of all time,\u201d Morey told ESPN . \u201cTo be able to say that with a straight face, and not have it be GM speak or coach speak, is pretty amazing. There\u2019s a whole bunch of ways to measure it, but he\u2019s for sure in the conversation as the greatest offensive player ever.\u201d Including his 50-point game Dec. 13 against the Los Angeles Lakers, Harden has scored at least 30 in 11 straight. He was named Western Conference player of the month for December and over the final 10 games of that month, Harden averaged 40.8 points. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he joined Bryant and Michael Jordan as the only players over the past 30 seasons to have scored at least 400 points over a span of 10 games. \u201cHe\u2019s at a level that almost nobody in NBA history has been at,\u201d Morey said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously focused on April and beyond, but it\u2019s special to watch right now.\u201d Warriors players and coaches couldn\u2019t help but laud Harden for his dazzling performance on Thursday night. \u201cHe just did what he does,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s the master of the isolation, the step-back 3 and drawing fouls.\u201d \u201cI mean, even Steph [Curry] during the game was like, \u2018Dude, what he\u2019s doing right now is crazy.\u2019 Dudes know what he\u2019s doing is legendary,\u201d Rockets guard Austin Rivers told ESPN. Harden recorded at least 35 points and five assists in each of the last eight games of December. According to Elias, that is the longest streak in NBA history. Harden had five double-doubles for the month, including three triple-doubles. He posted his NBA record fourth career 50-point triple double against the Lakers on Dec. 13 and closed out the year with his 10th career 40-point triple-double vs. Memphis on New Year\u2019s Eve. Harden leads the league in scoring (33.3 ppg) and ranks fourth in assists with 8.6 apg . He\u2019s also averaging 5.9 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game. The only player in NBA history to average at least 30 points, eight assists, five rebounds and two steals per game was Jordan in 1988-89 . There\u2019s no denying the hot streak Harden has been on, as Houston has used its star\u2019s performances to climb from 14th to fourth place in the West. In addition, the Rockets have the league\u2019s best record since Harden\u2019s scoring streak began on Dec. 11. Among the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorers, Harden\u2019s career 23.5 ppg scoring average ranks 21st and his 16,951 points ranks 96th . Earlier this week, Lakers star LeBron James said that by winning a title for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016 it \u201cmade me greatest player of all time.\u201d \u201cThat one right there made me the greatest player of all time,\u201d James said in an excerpt from the latest episode of ESPN\u2019s \u201cMore Than An Athlete\u201d series chronicling his career. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. I was super, super ecstatic to win one for Cleveland because of the 52-year (championship) drought. And then after I stopped (celebrating), I was like, that one right there made you the greatest player of all time. Everybody was talking how they were the greatest team ever assembled, and for us to come back the way we came back, I was like, you did something special. \u201cThat was one of the only times in my career I felt like, you did something special. I haven\u2019t had much time to sit back and think (about my achievements). But that was a moment.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36521,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-3-19","date":"2019-01-04","title":"About Last Night: Kawhi receives anti-hero's welcome","content":"Back in San Antonio for the first time since being traded to the Raptors, Kawhi Leonard was heckled relentlessly from the moment he stepped on the court. Leonard was booed every time he touched the ball during warmups. By contrast, Danny Green was cheered as if he were never dealt to Toronto along with Leonard. The Spurs showed a tribute video for Leonard and Green before introductions, highlighting big moments from their runs to the NBA Finals. Again, cheers for Green, jeers for Leonard. The same thing happened during introductions, as Spurs fans gave Green a standing ovation and then ramped up the boos for Leonard. The hostility toward Leonard continued after tip-off and seemed to impact the MVP candidate at times during the game. At one point, Leonard had to take a step back at the free-throw line and compose himself amid chants of \u201cTraitor! Traitor!\u201d from the crowd that adored him during his seven seasons in San Antonio. Leonard finished with 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting, as the Raptors rolled past the Spurs 125-107 . Despite the toxic atmosphere at the AT&T Center, Leonard and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich were able to share a nice moment at the end of the game. It was also an emotional night for DeMar DeRozan, who never wanted to be traded by the Raptors. Playing against his former team, DeRozan collected 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his first career triple-double. He\u2019s just the fifth player in NBA history to post a triple-double in his first game against a former team. Maybe we should have seen this coming. In one of his first tweets after the trade to San Antonio, DeRozan might have had this game in mind. Harden\u2019s historic run continues   There\u2019s no stopping James Harden right now. Just ask the Warriors . After another mesmerizing performance \u2014 which included a game-winning 3-pointer in overtime \u2014 Harden is averaging 40.1 points, 9.0 assists and 6.6 rebounds over his last 12 games. The Rockets are 11-1 during that span. Considering how the Warriors were able to take the lead before the final possession, Harden\u2019s game-winner was poetic justice. With 30 seconds left in overtime, Kevin Durant lost control of the ball in the paint and chased it into the corner. Taking three full steps out-of-bounds, Durant flung the ball back in play to Klay Thompson, who dished to an open Stephen Curry, who knocked down the 18-footer. Joel Embiid and Chris Paul were among the masses on Twitter reacting to the non-call: \u201cI felt badly about it. Kawhi\u2019s a high-character guy. We all make decisions in our lives with what we\u2019re going to do with our futures, and he has that same right as any of us.

In a related move, the Bulls also waived guard Cameron Payne. Brooks (6-5, 200) was selected 25th overall by the Boston Celtics in the 2011 NBA Draft, but was moved to the New Jersey Nets in a draft-night deal. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team during the 2011-12 season.  An NBA veteran with five seasons of service, Brooks has also played for the Celtics, Warriors, Lakers and Grizzlies. He holds career NBA averages of 8.0 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 17.3 minutes per game. This season, Brooks is averaging 6.6 points and 1.6 rebounds in 13.3 minutes over 29 games. He also played overseas from 2014-17 and has played in the G League for the Maine Red Claws and Santa Cruz Warriors. Selden Jr. (6-5, 230) went undrafted in the 2016 NBA Draft.

The Wizards announced Thursday that Morris was examined by a doctor after dealing with neck and upper back stiffness since getting hit on the chin during a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 16. Morris left that game at halftime with what the Wizards said then was a neck strain. He now will be limited to non-contact basketball activities for the next 1\u00bd months. The Wizards are scheduled to play 20 games in that span. The 29-year-old Morris has never appeared in fewer than the 63 games he played in during his rookie season back in 2011-12. The Wizards already were without All-Star point guard John Wall for the rest of this season because he needs an operation on his left heel and Achilles tendon, and they\u2019re also currently missing center Dwight Howard, who is expected to be out for at least another month or two after having spinal surgery for a herniated disk. Only four teams in the Eastern Conference own a worse record than Washington\u2019s 15-23 mark. Wall, Howard and Morris were originally slated to be three-fifths of Wizards coach Scott Brooks\u2019 starting lineup.

Raptors coach Nick Nurse told reporters before Thursday\u2019s shootaround that there is \u201can outside chance\u201d Lowry will play tonight. The guard, who is averaging 14.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 9.8 rebounds per game, has missed Toronto\u2019s last four games because of a back injury. He received pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory injections for his lower back pain on Dec. 29 and has been out since Dec. 26.

That ended a lengthy saga with Leonard over his nagging quadriceps injury that shelved him for all but nine games in 2017-18. How his injury was handled reportedly stirred up bad feelings between Leonard and the Spurs , leading to him demanding a trade. When asked if he had a message for Spurs fans, Leonard said: \u201cJust thanks for supporting me, Kawhi, the basketball player, and that\u2019s it, really.

After starting the season 11-14, the Rockets have won 10 of their last 11 games to climb from 14th to fourth place in the Western Conference . The last five wins have come without Chris Paul, who has been out with a hamstring injury . James Harden has made up for the absence of Paul, averaging 41.8 points over the five games . He has scored 39 or more in eight of his last 10 , averaging 14.9 free throw attempts per game over that stretch. Five of the Rockets\u2019 wins in this 10-1 stretch have come against teams that currently have winning records, but only two have come on the road, and the Rockets had a rest advantage (with their opponent having played the night before) in both of those road wins. They\u2019ll have another rest advantage in Portland on Saturday. But before they get there, they have a date with the Golden State Warriors in Oakland on Thursday. Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Rockets as they go into their second meeting with the champs \u2026 The Rockets have averaged just 74.1 minutes per game from players off the bench. That is the fewest bench minutes in the league by a wide margin and down from 84.6 minutes per game last season. One reason for the drop is that the Rockets haven\u2019t blown out their opponents as much as they did last season, when they led by at least 20 points for a league-high 450 minutes, 11 percent of their total minutes. This season, they\u2019ve led by 20 or more points for just 77 minutes (4 percent). But the Rockets\u2019 rotation has also been really thin. Last season, the Rockets had a steady group of eight veterans that all averaged at least 25 minutes in 58 or more games. Two of those guys \u2014 Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute \u2014 left via free agency last summer and a third \u2014 Ryan Anderson \u2014 was traded . Filling those holes has been a struggle. Carmelo Anthony was gone after 10 games . Michael Carter-Williams\u2019 run in the rotation didn\u2019t last that long. Isaiah Hartenstein (the 43rd pick in the 2017 draft ) and Gary Clark (an undrafted rookie on a two-way contract) were both forced into service in November when they should have been getting reps in the G League. Danuel House Jr. (who came from the G League) and Austin Rivers each played at least 28 minutes in a game within hours of signing contracts.  Injuries have taken their toll. Nene missed the first 21 games of the season, Chris Paul has missed eight games to injury (plus two more for a suspension), and James Ennis suffered a hamstring strain after losing his starting job at the start of this 10-1 stretch. In 12 of their 36 games, the Rockets have had only seven or eight guys play more than five minutes. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni has used only as many players as he\u2019s had to, often dropping one guy from the rotation as soon as another is available to replace him. Brandon Knight returned from a 22-month absence to play a few games, but was then replaced by Rivers. On top of a thin bench behind him, Harden leads the league in usage rate by a wide margin , having finished a career-high 37.4 percent of the Rockets possessions via a shot, turnover or trip to the line while he\u2019s been on the floor. In his minutes, he has accounted for 62 percent of the Rockets\u2019 points via his own scoring and assists points created (according to Second Spectrum tracking). Though he\u2019s missed three games, Harden has had possession of the ball for 46 more minutes than any other player this season. Over the last five games (without Paul), Harden has had a usage rate of 43.4 percent in 39.4 minutes per game. His Kia MVP candidacy (in each of the last three seasons) is about both his numbers and how much of a load he carries on the end of the floor in which his team is most successful. But it\u2019s unclear how long this recent stretch of super-high usage in heavy minutes can continue.  The interesting thing about the Rockets\u2019 bench is that, as thin as it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been rather effective in the minutes it\u2019s played. As they\u2019ve won 10 of their last 11 games, the Rockets have been better with Harden off the floor ( plus-16.0 points per 100 possessions ) than they\u2019ve been with him on the floor (plus-6.6). Harden is a plus-55 in 422 minutes over the 11 games, but has has had a negative plus-minus in three of the 10 wins , and his team has outscored its opponents by 37 points in just 106 minutes with him on the bench. The Rockets\u2019 best plus-minus totals over the 11 games belong to House (who came off the bench for the first six of those 11), Gerald Green (who hasn\u2019t started a game all season) and Nene (also a full-time reserve. Here\u2019s the thing. That plus-37 with Harden off the floor over this 10-1 stretch? It was a plus-42 with Paul on the floor in the five games before he got hurt. Though the Rockets\u2019 bench hasn\u2019t got killed when Harden has sat since then, a big part of its plus-minus success over the last two years has been D\u2019Antoni\u2019s ability to have at least one of his two primary ball-handlers on the floor at all times. In the games that both Harden and Paul have played this season, the Rockets have been outscored by 3.0 points per 48 minutes in their 501 minutes on the floor together. But in those 23 games, they\u2019ve outscored their opponents by 10.6 points per 48 minutes in 572 total minutes with either Harden or Paul on the floor without the other. The pair\u2019s minutes together were much better last season, when the Rockets outscored their opponents by 12.4 points 48 minutes with them both on the floor. But their minutes apart (in the games in which they both played) were similarly effective (plus-12.3 per 48). They had improved defensive numbers (playing against the opponents\u2019 reserves), but didn\u2019t see a big drop-off on offense. So while spots 6-9 in the Rockets\u2019 rotation remain in flux, spots 1 and 2 remain the most important.

Antonio Daniels isn\u2019t going to lie \u2014 he liked the sound of a job that could pay him a hefty salary for two or three hours of work each day. Steve Novak approached it like a coin flip, figuring he was just as likely to hate picking up a microphone as love it. Caron Butler had nurtured the idea for more than a decade, ever since he got traded to Washington in 2005 and met three-time All-Star turned Wizards color analyst Phil Chenier . Drew Gooden remembered how impressed he was when he caught Richard (Rip) Hamilton doing an NBA TV gig, then found out how he got there. All roads led those former NBA players to and through \u201cSportscaster U.,\u201d the unofficial name of a popular and long-running career development program offered by the National Basketball Players Association. They\u2019re five of the more than 60 players who have participated in the program, and all five are working in one capacity or another \u2014 in some cases, multiple jobs \u2014 on TV and radio basketball broadcasts. \u201cSportscaster U.\u201d has helped them find a second career that piggybacks off, and keeps alive, their first. Placing an estimated 80 percent of its alumni in some form of sports broadcasting \u2014 from game analyst to studio commentator, from sideline work to sports-talk host \u2014 it quickly became one of the NBPA\u2019s most successful programs. Anything that can help athletes transition into the so-called real world, starting out at an age when most folks are hitting their professional strides, is appreciated. This one made connecting those dots from here to there so much easier. \u201cMy first 10 years,\u201d Jefferson said, \u201cwhenever someone would call me to do [a broadcast appearance], I\u2019d feel exhausted during the season and say, \u2018Dude, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 But as you get a little older and you\u2019re approaching retirement, you\u2019re more like, \u2018OK, this might be a good opportunity.\u2019 \u201d The opportunity wasn\u2019t there, however, for interested players in 2018. It\u2019s status for this summer? To be determined. * * * \u201cI viewed it as, \u2018My career could start closing down.\u2019 Any teammate will tell you that I never shut up. So just being around the sport that I love, in almost any capacity, was really interesting to me. Broadcasting was something people kind of asked me about. \u2026 I\u2019d seen other guys go through it and it looked like a great program. I truly was blown away.\u201d \u2014 Richard Jefferson * * * There\u2019s a long history of NBA players moving over to (or up to, given their perches in most arenas these days) the broadcast table. Legendary names such as Jack Twyman, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Bob Cousy and Rick Barry were some of the pioneers who lent credibility and expertise to the play-by-play calls of so many layman announcers. Tom Heinsohn and Walt Frazier, among others, still are at it, Hall of Famers known to two or three generations of fans more for their on-air personalities than their on-court exploits. The success of studio shows staged by the league\u2019s broadcast partners, Turner Sports and ESPN\/ABC, and the players who populate those sets led to a formula imitated on regional sports networks across the U.S. Now there are Internet-based offerings, too, and outlets such as social media and podcasting opening up new platforms for ex-players. The idea of helping its members prepare for such opportunities, though, dates back more than a decade to 2008. \u201cIt came out of some brainstorming on our part, and from asking players what they wanted as far as programs,\u201d said Deborah Murman, director of the NBPA\u2019s career development department. \u201cWe\u2019re here to equip guys with the skills and resources they need to be successful off the court.\u201d Among the NBPA\u2019s other offerings: Seminars and mentoring programs in real estate, technology and franchising. The union also runs programs, overseen by former player Purvis Short , to acquaint its members with possible careers in coaching or in a team\u2019s front office. \u201cThat year [2017], it hit me when I got the mailing that you could go listen to speakers from the Harvard Business School on sports management,\u201d said Novak, who played 11 seasons for nine teams . \u201cYou could do the real estate symposium. You could follow around a Google executive, an American Express executive. You could go to Sportscaster U. \u201cI finally said, I need to take advantage of this. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to play basketball forever. This was after my last year, and I thought I was still playing.\u201d Said Daniels, the No. 4 overall pick in 1997 who logged 13 years as a role-playing guard : \u201cIt\u2019s a tough transition, to not knowing what\u2019s next. You\u2019re leaving behind something you\u2019re extremely passionate about. What this does, it lets you stay connected, stay involved, see guys and coaches you played with and played under.\u201d Rich Rinaldi, an NBA old-schooler known by most current players for his work as an NBPA career counselor, oversaw Sportscaster U. almost from its inception. He took it as a personal challenge to recruit, monitor and follow up on the participants \u201cI\u2019d tell them, you\u2019re going to have a lot of money but you\u2019re going to want to do something,\u201d said Rinaldi, who retired from the NBPA after 18 years in 2017. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to stay in the game. That\u2019s how I sold this to \u2019em. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to make any promises. But I will promise you this \u2014 when you\u2019re leaving Syracuse, heading to the airport, you will thank me for this.\u2019 \u201d Said Murman: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be asked to make [a TV] appearance once. Your goal is to be asked back. A little training will enhance your changes of that happening. We talk about creating the life you want to live after basketball.\u201d To go from playing and immersing oneself in basketball, to talking and immersing oneself in the game as usual, would seem to be an obvious and natural transition. Obvious, sure. Natural? Not so fast. * * * \u201cI always say, if you hit the lottery and get millions of dollars \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much what happens when we play in the NBA, we hit the jackpot \u2014 and after you go on vacations and get things you want, all right, now what? What\u2019s next? So many guys never find it. I found something I love and I\u2019m passionate about. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about being in that happy place. You\u2019ve got another 30, 40 years of good living \u2014 you want to do it right. \u2014 Caron Butler * * * The NBPA didn\u2019t mess around. If you want to build from scratch a program of sports broadcasting, you go to the best. Syracuse University\u2019s Newhouse School of Public Communications counts Marv Albert, Bob Costas, Mike Tirico, Ian Eagle and more among its alumni. As Sportscaster U.\u2019s lead professor, the NBPA brought in Matt Park, Syracuse\u2019s football and men\u2019s basketball play-by-play man. Over the years, the program enlisted help from the likes of Steve Infanti, sports director at WSYR-TV9, and Marc Zumoff, the \u201cvoice\u201d of the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cThe program spoke for itself after a couple of years, because word got around,\u201d Rinaldi said. \u201cWe tweaked it every year. By the 10th year, we had grown the program so much.\u201d In 2015, the NBPA added a \u201cgraduate\u201d course in conjunction with its \u201cTop 100\u201d basketball camp for high school prospects held each summer at the University of Virginia. There, NBA players who had gone through the Syracuse offering could get actual game experience, analyzing players and teams, tackling pre- and post-game chores and doing sideline interviews and stand-ups. \u201cThe big challenge there was, you\u2019re calling the game without knowing the players,\u201d Murman said. \u201cThey really had to do their homework.\u201d The Syracuse program was held each year in early June, starting the same weekend as The Finals. Players arrived on Friday and began that day with \u201cclassroom\u201d training, studying video and participating in production plans. They would spend Saturday morning in the studio, learning and working in a variety of roles with Parks leading the way. Come Sunday, they would shift gears to focus on radio work before departing Monday. Enrollment typically was limited to eight players. A production team of 12 to 15 professionals was needed, with a budget for the long weekend of approximately $80,000. Cost to the players: $5,500, although starting in 2014 that simply was what they were required to deposit to hold their place. Once they attended, Rinaldi said, that money was returned to them. Players were responsible for their hotel costs and airfare. Each participant leaves with an edited DVD of their performances, presumably a few new skills, and a sense of whether they would enjoy the work. \u201cAfter I went to Sportscaster U., I was so terrible there that I thought, \u2018Maybe this isn\u2019t for me,\u2019 \u201d said Drew Gooden, who played 13 seasons for nine teams . \u201cBut that\u2019s what it\u2019s for, for first-timers to get their first live reps. \u201cYour peers are with you, so it becomes like \u2018America\u2019s Funniest\u2019 out takes, because everyone is there ready to laugh. But you found out what you\u2019re bad at and what you needed to work on. \u201cI\u2019d hate to discourage any guys to pursue it, because I\u2019ll tell you what, there was nobody who did a worse job than Drew Gooden. But once I was able to get real-life reps, I think I was overprepared.\u201d * * * \u201cA lot of players are reluctant to put themselves out there to try something different that\u2019s not basketball, because we\u2019re probably going to suck at it because it\u2019s not what we do. It\u2019s embarrassing to go into a normal college setting and be this highly touted NBA player who\u2019s a bit of a fool at whatever else you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u2014 Steve Novak * * * The old saying, \u201cmake your mistakes in the minor leagues,\u201d applies to sports as well as non-sport professions. One purpose of Sportscaster U. was to carve out a safe space for players to learn, try, stumble and try again. \u201cThe one thing that stuck in my head was reps, reps, reps,\u201d said Jefferson, welcoming the chance to mess up without actually being live on someone\u2019s TV. Of course, Jefferson was a special case, preparing and starting to cobble a network of connections in his new field before he\u2019d exited the old. While playing for the Utah Jazz in 2013-14, he called up a local station and volunteered to come to the studio to fill out an NCAA tournament bracket. By the time he got to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2015-16, four years after his Sportscaster U. training, he and teammate Channing Frye started their \u201cRoadtrippin\u2019 \u201d podcast . Jefferson says that it is on track to soon be spun into a TV show. Jefferson, who has worked both NCAA and NBA games this season in addition to appearing on ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up!\u201d morning show, began the podcast partly to get more comfortable as a host. \u201cIf not for Sportscaster U.,\u201d he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had that mindset for growth and reps.\u201d Here are some other lessons learned and experiences gleaned at Sportscaster U.: \u2014 To mark the program\u2019s 10th anniversary in 2017, Hall of Famer Shaquille O\u2019Neal recorded a testimonial. \u201cWhat qualities make Sportscaster U. unique?\u201d he said. \u201cIt teaches you the ins and outs of broadcasting. I learned a lot about camera angles, production aspects. There are a lot of veteran players who have great knowledge of the game, and Sportscaster U. will help them get comfortable sitting behind the desk, looking into the camera. \u201cSome guys can talk when they\u2019re amongst themselves, but when that camera gets in their face, sometimes they freeze up. But if you attend Sportscaster U., they will help you get rid of your fears.\u201d \u2014 Jefferson noted the wide range of aptitude for broadcast work, citing the very different early performances of former Dallas Cowboys Tony Romo and Jason Witten in NFL booths. Romo was an instant hit, especially lauded for his ability to anticipate plays. Witten had a bumpier start, such as the Oct. 15 game in which he said Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers \u201cpulled a rabbit out of his head.\u201d \u201cBoth guys entered the booth with little to no experience,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cIt shows you there\u2019s a skill, a talent, an art to it. There\u2019s a difference between making a guest spot and being on television every day. You have to learn how to do these things, and just because you\u2019re articulate, just because you\u2019re talented, just because you have the gift of gab \u2026 those aren\u2019t the only things required to be successful. Things that, if you don\u2019t go to school for it, you\u2019re going to be taught while on air . Right? That\u2019s very difficult.\u201d \u2014 For instance? \u201cThey put us in position to learn how to call highlights,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cMaking sure you know X, Y and Z, where the highlights will be. And how, when you\u2019re calling a basketball game [as an analyst], you\u2019re job basically is to talk between 3-point line and 3-point line. \u2026 Replays are for color commentary. That\u2019s for the specialist who supposedly knows more than everyone else. He\u2019s going to explain to you why this happened, why this was an impressive dunk, why this crossover or spin move is so difficult or why the coach called this play.\u201d \u2014 \u201cI learned how difficult it is to talk when someone\u2019s talking in your ear,\u201d said Daniels, of mastering ear-piece skills. \u201cI learned how difficult it is to talk for a minute straight \u2014 in real life, a minute\u2019s nothing, but when they tell you to talk about why the Boston Celtics are going to repeat, it was so difficult at the time to do that without repeating yourself or going \u2018uh\u2026 uh\u2026\u2019 It really made me uncomfortable.\u201d \u2014 Tiago Splitter, the former San Antonio Spurs big man and first international enrollee at Sportscaster U., participated in 2016 in English, his second language. Then the 6-foot-11 Brazilian was told to work in his native tongue, Portuguese. \u201cYou could tell by how much he said how much more comfortable he was,\u201d Rinaldi said. \u2014 Butler juggles a mix of broadcast gigs, including NBA TV stints, studio work on Spectrum working Lakers games and co-hosting a Sunday radio show on the Fox Sports network. He credits Rinaldi for encouraging his participation. \u201cI found my niche,\u201d Butler said. He also picked up a few skills after attending Sportscaster U. in 2012 and 2016: \u201cI learned about trimming my thoughts, about the need for being punctual and having that presence of really being comfortable in front of the camera. It changed the game for me.\u201d \u2014 Studying film is as necessary in their new career as in their old. Said Butler: \u201cSometimes players don\u2019t want to watch film, because they see, \u2018Oh [snap] I should have helped on defense.\u2019 It\u2019s the same that goes into your craft when you\u2019re on television. You see, \u2018That\u2019s my crutch word. I keep saying that word.\u2019 All sort of things, you learn about yourself and you try to correct.\u201d \u2014 What\u2019s the key to criticizing a friend or former teammate? \u201cWhen it\u2019s right, it\u2019s right,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong. Some guys pick and pick and pick. I just tell the truth. And I\u2019m giving you a visual where, if you go back and watch it yourself, you\u2019ll see exactly what I see.\u201d \u2014 For Gooden, getting past the cameras and the realization there were hundreds of thousands of eyeballs on him at any point in time was essential. \u201cBeing myself was the biggest takeaway. I kind of came off as a robot when I was trying to analyze basketball situations. That wasn\u2019t showing my personality \u2014 I\u2019m a charismatic guy, I like to have fun, I like to laugh. None of that came off on camera at all. I was like a frightened child with stage fright. \u201cThey gave us our clips of everything we did and I would cringe when I watched it. I\u2019d be like, \u2018Turn it off! Turn it off!\u2019 I felt I had one good take from that week, and that was all I had to give my agent.\u201d Now Gooden works 41 games for the Wizards before, during or after. He also does some TV work in Orlando, where he lives. \u2014 Novak appreciated the heavy class load of Sportscaster U. \u201cWe were on the \u2018green screen,\u2019 we were at the anchor desk, we did interviews, we did color, we studied the game. And because we were at Syracuse, we were able to do all that in one place. It was the most real boot camp you could do.\u201d Two weeks after Novak completed the program, the Milwaukee Bucks called out of the blue to see if he was interested in joining their broadcast team. He began by doing a segment for the pre-and post-game shows. Then he moved into a host\u2019s chair. Now he works alongside play-by-play man Jim Paschke on some games in relief of Marques Johnson or Jon McGlocklin. One door had closed, another immediately opened. \u201cThe timing was uncanny,\u201d Novak said. * * * \u201cI\u2019m appalled. There are so many great minds in basketball and so many guys who could do this on camera, they may never know they\u2019d be able to do it. Sportscaster U. gave you the reps. You got to see if you\u2019re good. You got to compare yourself to your peers. You got feedback, and you left with film. For that not to go on would be a loss for the NBA and the union.\u201d \u2014 Drew Gooden * * * Gooden had just been told that Sportscaster U. was not offered in 2018. Neither the Syracuse program nor the \u201cTop 100\u201d version in Virginia was held, shutting down the former after 10 flourishing years and the latter after just three. What happened? \u201cWe did not offer it [last] summer for a variety of reasons I\u2019d rather not go into,\u201d Murman said in a recent phone interview. \u201cWe are reviving it for next summer. Once I have more details, I can share it with you.\u201d There were a few reasons cited by multiple sources for keeping Sportscaster U. shuttered last year. One was apparent dissatisfaction with the main program\u2019s location in upstate New York; some felt the program would be more attractive if offered in Manhattan or Los Angeles. Two other claims \u2014 that modern NBA retirees will have made too much money to seriously pursue second careers, and a belief that millennials aren\u2019t interested in traditional TV and radio jobs \u2014 floated around as well. Then there\u2019s the suspicion that, with Rinaldi retired, the work of planning and organizing went undone. There was sufficient interest, Rinaldi said, with three active NBA players expressing interest well before the 2017-18 season ended. The program needed a minimum of four participants. Murman indicated it is possible Sportscaster U. will be relocated when revived this summer, though not due to any shortcomings in or displeasure with Syracuse. There has been speculation that ESPN might want to play a role. Rinaldi understandably was unhappy that a project he devoted so much time to slipped through the cracks, at best, and wasn\u2019t available to interested players. \u201cThe NBPA failed its members last summer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had that program on auto-pilot. To make excuses really diminishes the hard work these players put in and what it took to get them there.\u201d Just as Gooden was \u201cappalled\u201d to learn of the program\u2019s absence last summer, other grads expressed disappointment and urged that it be reinstated. \u201cIt definitely is worth reviving,\u201d said Daniels, who returned to speak at the 2017 camp. He has an ESPN radio show in San Antonio, serves as a host on Sirius XM NBA Radio and works in studio for Fox Sports Southwest. \u201cIt would be a shame if they don\u2019t have it, because there are so many players who would be good at this. The NBA is a fraternity, and you want to see as many guys succeed as possible.\u201d Jefferson sounded determined. \u201cI promise you, that won\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program is so, so important. It almost feels like being an alumni of your basketball program. You can\u2019t let something fail after you\u2019ve seen the benefits of the program. So yeah, that\u2019s kind of shocking to me. But it will be back.\u201d Said Daniels: \u201cSo often, you don\u2019t respect someone\u2019s occupation till you\u2019re put in their shoes. Things always seem easier when you\u2019re on the outside looking in. \u2018Aw, man, I can do that. I can sit and talk about sports.\u2019 As athletes, this really removed you from your comfort zone.

Yet while he continues to shine, his New Orleans Pelicans continue to struggle. Last night was a microcosm of those notions, with Davis dominating ( 34 points and a career-high 26 rebounds ) and the Pelicans faltering (in a 126-121 road loss to the Brooklyn Nets ). The Pelicans have lost seven of their last 10 games, are 13-22 after starting the season 4-0 and are 6-10 since Dec. 1 . Davis said after last night\u2019s loss that he knows his team can still make a playoff push, but that it also can\u2019t keep losing ground in a crowded Western Conference playoff chase. \u201cWe can\u2019t sleep in the West,\u201d Davis said, per Nick Veronica of the New Orleans Advocate . \u201cWe know that it\u2019s a loaded conference. Brooklyn had the same record as us (17-21) and they were ninth; we\u2019re 14th. It\u2019s a loaded conference. We\u2019ve got to be able to put a streak of wins together. \u201cThe frustration is, we\u2019re a better team than our record shows,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, everyone\u2019s frustrated \u2014 players, coaches, front office. We just have to be better. We know what we did last year, we know how good of a team we are.\u201d In particular, Davis sounded off on the Pelicans\u2019 defense vs. the Nets. Brooklyn scored 73 points in the first half, which included a 10-for-18 showing in 3-pointers . Brooklyn led by 18 after three quarters before New Orleans closed within five after a late flurry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t playing defense,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe whole first half, they did whatever they wanted \u2026 we weren\u2019t physical, weren\u2019t talking. They got a lot of layups, a lot of open 3s. They shot the ball extremely well in the first half due to our lazy defense. \u201cWe just talked in the second half, were a little more physical to the ball, rebounding, talking on the switches, stuff like that,\u201d Davis added. \u201cWhen we do that \u2014 talking, helping each other \u2014 we\u2019re a good defensive team. But when we\u2019re not, like we displayed in the first half, we can be one of the worst defensive teams in the league.\u201d Elfrid Payton scored 25 points for New Orleans in his second game back after missing more than a month with a broken finger. Julius Randle had 21 and Jrue Holiday 20, but the Pelicans got next to nothing from their bench. Davis has scored 30 or more points 13 times this season, but the Pelicans are 8-5 in those games . Last season, New Orleans was 20-8 when he crossed the 30-point plateau. Last night\u2019s defeat marked the first time New Orleans lost with both Davis and Payton in the lineup (they were 5-0 when both played). The Pelicans have the most road-heavy January schedule in the Western Conference, with nine of their 14 January games on the road.

The former free agent and current Kia MVP candidate didn\u2019t even take a meeting with Magic Johnson & Co. during the summer, instead opting to remain with Oklahoma City before any temptation to do otherwise could be sprung upon him. The lack of an All-Star sidekick for LeBron James hasn\u2019t stopped the Lakers from remaining in the playoff picture, but that didn\u2019t stop their fans from raining boos on George early and often. When that didn\u2019t work, the Laker faithful united under the defiant cry of \u201cWe don\u2019t need you.\u201d The vocal displeasure fell on deaf ears. George finished with a game-high 37 points on 15-for-29 shooting in OKC\u2019s 107-100 win. And though he likely enjoyed his performance in the unusual \u201chomecoming\u201d (George was raised in Palmdale, Calif.), Russell Westbrook appeared to appreciate it even more. The former MVP broke out an incredibly enthusiastic air guitar when George slipped past Lance Stephenson for an and-one thanks to a particularly nasty dribble sequence. And that wasn\u2019t enough. Westbrook felt compelled to add a wink and kiss, which we can only assume were directed toward Stephenson. Westbrook\u2019s glee on George\u2019s behalf is symbolic of the shift between the two. It is George who leads the team in scoring and shot attempts, George who is representing the Thunder in the MVP discussions. So far, Westbrook seems fine with the transition. It\u2019s not as though he has given up his competitive edge , which led him to angrily knock a water bottle off the scorer\u2019s table as the Lakers were making a second-half run. Rudy Gobert, who set the bar last month of scorer\u2019s table anger management, wasn\u2019t impressed. There are franchise players, then there\u2019s the guy who prints reverse posters on them. Here\u2019s a list of Jarrett Allen\u2019s high-profile victims this season: Blake Griffin: Stephen Curry: Nikola Jokic: John Wall: Kawhi Leonard: LeBron James: Giannis Antetokounmpo: And, on Wednesday, Allen added Davis to the list: Gordon Hayward\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d game occurred on Dec. 1 at Minnesota, when he put up 30 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in just under 30 minutes. The former All-Star has been relatively quiet since, scoring in double figures just four times in that span. Fast-forward to Wednesday against, you guessed it, the same Timberwolves team. Something about the team that valued Wesley Johnson as a better shooting guard than Hayward in the 2010 Draft must really appeal to the Celtics swingman. Hayward couldn\u2019t be stopped, hitting 14 of his final 16 shots en route to a 35-point night in Boston\u2019s 115-102 victory.  \u201cThe Brow\u201d has done some big things in New Orleans, but never has he dominated the boards like he did against Brooklyn. The Pelicans superstar swallowed a career and franchise-best 26 rebounds to go along with 34 points and three blocks in the 126-121 loss to the Nets. The performance saw Davis leapfrog multiple efforts by former teammate DeMarcus Cousins and former New Orleans Hornet Tyson Chandler, who between them accounted for the top 10 single-game rebounding performances in franchise history. We\u2019re not sure who was more ready at tipoff: The Dallas Mavericks, who sank a franchise-record 10 3-pointers in the opening quarter?  Or Joel Embiid, who logged a 30-point, 14-rebound double-double by halftime  in Phoenix ? Kudos to Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News for getting some perspective on 41-year-old Dirk Nowitzki passing the torch to 19-year-old Luka Doncic. Yes, the latter is having a steller rookie season. Just don\u2019t think that present-day Doncic could hold a candle to in-his-prime Dirk. When asked who would win in 1-on-1, Nowitzki made it clear that timing is everything. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of moves in the one-on-one games,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of shots in his repertoire. I\u2019d probably go with him now. But back in the days?

That, in essence, is what Paul George did last summer when he reached free agency and was free to go wherever and play next to whomever. While there are obvious logistical and lifestyle differences between lacing up with the Thunder in folksy Oklahoma City and the Lakers in glamorous Los Angeles that one must weigh, the core decision for an All-Star in his prime was selecting who he will ride with. So George did precisely what a fair segment of the hoops world wouldn\u2019t have (the basketballs to do), as many questioned his wisdom for re-signing with the Thunder and re-attaching himself to the ball-dominating Westbrook. Three months into the season, it appears George chose wisely and did what\u2019s best for him, if winning and happiness are what counts. The Thunder are north of the Lakers in the standings today and the basketball and personal rhapsody between George and Westbrook has a good flow (although time will eventually deliver a verdict in the matter of both). \u201cI came here to win,\u201d George said. \u201cBottom line.\u201d The fact that this duo is working says much about George, of course, and more about Westbrook and the former Kia MVP\u2019s ability to prevent another franchise teammate from leaving. The ultimate winner in the equation is Oklahoma City, still crackling on the court and positioning itself to be the last team standing in the Western Conference between the Golden State Warriors and a trip to The Finals. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty adaptable,\u201d George said. \u201cI can pattern my game to work with whomever I\u2019m playing with.\u201d That includes LeBron James. George said he\u2019d have no problems coexisting with LeBron had he signed up for that duty. Easy-going in personality and unselfish in playing style, George would\u2019ve made for a unique tandem with the Lakers. The connection between George and L.A. began two years before LeBron arrived. As he approached the final year of his contract with the Indiana Pacers, George wanted out , and the Lakers made trade inquiries about a player born and raised an hour north of town. Indiana sent him to OKC in a trade that was initially vilified. However, it worked out quite well for the Pacers, who received future franchise cornerstones in forward Domantas Sabonis and last season\u2019s Kia Most Improved Player winner, Victor Oladipo . When OKC never managed any serious traction last season, the chase for the Lakers was back on. Yet George felt so strongly about finishing what he started with Westbrook that he didn\u2019t even give the Lakers an interview last summer. He made his first appearance against the Lakers at Staples Center on Wednesday and showed the crowd what could\u2019ve been, with 37 points in OKC\u2019s 107-100 win . Last season\u2019s ambitious re-tooling for the Thunder went disastrously, as they imploded in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz and failed to find a role for Carmelo Anthony and his decaying skills. However, this season is pumping the brakes on any visions of an encore. The reasons for OKC\u2019s rebirth fall in line behind the obvious: the sneakers of George and Westbrook are in step. This is reflected mostly through the play of George, who\u2019s rolling better than he did on any of those fine Pacers teams, better than he did pre-leg injury, better than he did during a fluid-but-not-unforgettable first season in OKC. You could even make a case for giving George a seat at the early Kia MVP roundtable , because 26.4 points (remarkable on a team with Westbrook), 8.2 rebounds (tremendous for a small forward), 4.1 assists and 2.2 steals a game demand that level of respect. It\u2019s possible George is reaching his career peak here at 28, which means the timing is right for he and OKC. For years, George was a level below the NBA\u2019s heavyweights (and still might be), but his first season as a $30 million player isn\u2019t giving OKC any buyer\u2019s remorse. He may even earn a spot on the 2018-19 All-NBA team. What\u2019s more, Westbrook isn\u2019t hindering George\u2019s game. This fear was built largely on Westbrook\u2019s relentless style as plays live or die based on his decisions. But what needed to be taken into account was George, whose game and personality seems a perfect fit next to Westbrook. After being the lead singer all those years in Indiana, George is comfortable playing off the skills of another star. He isn\u2019t threatened by Westbrook nor put off by the guard\u2019s high usage rate. And Westbrook has made adjustments as well to ensure George feels free and at home. Westbrook is taking fewer shots (21.1 to 19.3) and often yielding to George during tense late-game moments, especially when the situation calls for 3-pointers, where George is a significantly better option than Westbrook (38 percent to 24 percent). \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be an easy transition,\u201d George admitted. \u201cWe both would have to learn a lot about ourselves and each other. And we did. That\u2019s just the patience needed in this situation. \u201cLast year with Carmelo, we tried to force it to happen instead of trying to build toward it, letting chemistry happen first. That\u2019s been the key right now, having patience and let everything play itself through.\u201d So there\u2019s a kinship between George and Westbrook that wasn\u2019t apparent during the final seasons with Westbrook and Kevin Durant, and evidently so. One player bailed on Westbrook \u2026 and the other stayed. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making someone wanting to stay here,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a bond, friendship, outside of basketball. When you have the bond and friendship that\u2019s bigger than basketball, to me that\u2019s the important part. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to learn about him and his family, where he\u2019s from, how get got here.\u201d George carried OKC in scoring while Westbrook missed eight games with injuries and there\u2019s been on-court balance between the two since. It also helps that Jerami Grant has a new-found jumper and Dennis Schroder, imported from the Atlanta Hawks, brings an energy boost and 15.9 ppg off the bench. It\u2019s a team that holds a mildly-surprising top-three spot in the West and will soon see the return of defensive ace Andre Roberson from a ruptured patellar tendon . George said he would\u2019ve worked well with the Lakers. While that\u2019s a safe assumption, what he\u2019s doing with OKC is solid proof. \u201cI have a better feel for not only Russ but Steven (Adams) and Jerami,\u201d George said. \u201cI was brought here for a reason, to win and win big. This year it\u2019s out there for us. We know where we want to get to and we\u2019re allowing it to happen, to develop.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Luke Kornet has taken Kanter\u2019s starting job, but Kanter has worked to support him even in his backup role. \u201cIt\u2019s just, all this anger and frustration is coming from losing,\u201d Kanter said, per Popper. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun to lose 12, 13, whatever in a row. It\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s just tough, man. But obviously I had a meeting with Scott. He just said, \u2018You know, this is the growth. This is one of your biggest tests in your career, so just try to be a good teammate.\u2019 That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do. Just help the young guys and try to be the best teammate you can be. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. Again, this organization is paying me. I don\u2019t want no free money. So every time I\u2019m out there I\u2019m going to try to get a win.\u201d Kanter was acquired from Oklahoma City in 2017 in exchange for Carmelo Anthony and underwent a stint earlier this season in which he came off the bench. That stretch, however, still saw the 7-foot big man average over 25 minutes per game. The former third overall pick of the 2011 draft is averaging 14.4 points and 10.6 rebounds per game while shooting 54.3 percent. The Knicks\u2019 defensive rating, however, is 5.3 points better when Kanter is on the bench."},{"id":36584,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-avery-bradley-scuffle","date":"2019-01-02","title":"Butler, Bradley ejected after scuffle in fourth quarter","content":"The Philadelphia 76ers and LA Clippers started the 2019 portion of their seasons with the Sixers collecting a 119-113 win marked by chippy play and two ejections. First, Sixers center Joel Embiid and Clippers guard Patrick Beverley received offsetting technicals at 9:32 in the fourth quarter after getting tangled up. Embiid grabbed a rebound and Beverley yanked his jersey. Sixers reserve Jonah Bolden pulled Beverley off Embiid in a mass of players. Minutes later, the Clippers\u2019 Avery Bradley and the Sixers\u2019 Jimmy Butler got tied up going for a rebound and shoved each other. Referees and security were quick to come on the court and separate the players. They were each hit with technicals and ejected with 7:01 to play. \u201cWe got too close to one another and the same things happen: some pushing, some shoving, some technical fouls and we got ejected,\u201d Butler said. After the game, Butler was asked if the shoves warranted the ejection and if officials gave him an explanation. He told Philly.com\u2019s Keith Pompey that there was no explanation given and overall, that sort of thing is not his call. \u201cHe said \u2018ejected,\u2019 so I went to the locker room,\u201d Butler said, per Pompey . \u201cI mean, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d Butler also pointed out that competitive play is what he likes to see. \u201cThat\u2019s what Philly likes to see,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the league is there for. The competitiveness. Obviously nobody wants to see a fight. But I like the energy that it brings.\u201d Bradley was not made available to the media after the game. As for the Embiid-Beverley incident, Embiid said he had no problem with Beverley because of it. \u201cI love that guy,\u201d Embiid said of Beverley, per ESPN\u2019s Kevin Arnovitz . \u201cHe\u2019s like [Thunder star Russell] Westbrook \u2014 plays hard.

The first day of game action is in, and though there were but five games on the slate, we didn\u2019t lack for standout performances. On to the action: Portland Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic is known for filling the stat sheet. And after Tuesday\u2019s 113-108 overtime victory , he\u2019s now the owner of a ledger line all to his own. Per Elias, he\u2019s the only player to log a 20-20 \u201c5\u00d75\u201d after dropping 24 points, 23 rebounds, 7 assists, 5 steals and 5 blocks on the Kings, who fumbled away a game they led entering the fourth. Simply posting a 5\u00d75 is, in and of itself, an incredible rarity. This is just the 21st instance since the league started tracking steals and blocks in 1973-74. Anthony Davis was the most recent player to achieve the feat, doing so earlier this season with 12 points, 16 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 steals and 5 blocks against the 76ers on November 21. And yet, perhaps no single number might carry more weight than block No. 4, which stopped Willie Cauley-Stein cold and sent Damian Lillard out on transition. Lillard\u2019s layup cut the lead to a single basket, and another pair of blocks later, Lillard \u2014 who was sick! \u2014 sent the game to OT, where the Blazers quickly pulled away. Nurkic is averaging 14.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.3 blocks on the year, and is a big reason why the Blazers are hanging solidly in playoff contention yet again. With performances like these, it\u2019s no surprise the \u201cBosnian Beast\u201d has become a favorite of #NBATwitter. With Thursday\u2019s first foray to San Antonio looming, Kawhi Leonard appears to be, shall we say \u2026 locked in? Leonard took this game into his ( massive ) hands during the third quarter, pushing an already solid line toward the spectacular with a 7-for-7 showing that added 19 to the ledger and launched the Raptors to a cushion vs. Utah that they\u2019d not relent . He ultimately finished with a career-high 45 points (16-22 FGs, 13-17 FTs), adding six rebounds and an assist. Offering strong support was Pascal Siakam, who etched a new personal best with 28 points (9-15 FGs, 3-4 FTs), along with 10 boards for the double-double. Anyone wondering why today was the day for Siakam only needed to check the pregame warmups, where the third-year center was clearly feeling himself. * Wednesday on NBA TV:  Jazz vs. Raptors re-airs (4 p.m. ET) The night of NBA notables continued rolling in Denver, where Nikola Jokic put up a 15-assist triple-double to help the Nuggets stymie the visiting New York Knicks , 115-108. Yes, you read that right: 15 assists, linked up with 19 points and 14 rebounds. Throw in three blocks for a line last achieved by Larry Legend. The Nuggets\u2019 slick passing big now claims four of the 14 times centers have posted at least 15 assists, with a career-high of 17 coming on last February\u2019s wild 30-15-17 triple-double. Wilt Chamberlain owns nine. The other one? Clemon Johnson. Only took a quarter for Giannis Antetokounmpo to ring in the NBA\u2019s new year with a full extension wallop on poor Jon Leuer, who\u2019s officially been GIF\u2019d: Yikes. Out in Los Angeles, the Clippers lost to the Philadelphia 76ers 119-113 as things escalated quickly during the fourth quarter. Several feisty exchanges culminated in this double-tech worthy shoving match between Avery Bradley and Jimmy Butler that left both players headed for early showers: Shout out, Matt Doyle .

The Spurs struggled severely in November, pairing their below-average offense with the NBA\u2019s worst defense. They finished the month with a 5-10 record and sat 10-12 overall, just in front of the lowly Phoenix Suns. Injuries began to pile up, LaMarcus Aldridge struggled shooting and their ability to win on the road was nonexistent. While the latter issue still hasn\u2019t been fixed, a shift occurred for the Spurs in December. San Antonio finished No. 1 in offensive efficiency during the last month of 2018 and ranked among the top 10 in defensive efficiency. Seeming to have found their rhythm, the Spurs shot a league-high 51.2 percent from the floor in December, boasted the NBA\u2019s best Net Rating and closed the year out winning 10 of their last 13 games. Talk about ending a year on the right track. Here\u2019s a look at the best records, offenses and defenses based on numbers from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31 only. The Pacers have quietly climbed to third in the Eastern Conference standings , holding the same amount of wins as the first-place Bucks. The sweepstakes for Zion Williamson, who played at Madison Square Garden in December, roll on. ( Points scored per 100 possessions ) While the Spurs are rolling, the hottest team in Texas \u2014 and the NBA for that matter \u2014 is Houston. James Harden is carrying the Rockets offense without Chris Paul at a historic pace . Dwane Casey\u2019s first year in Detroit hasn\u2019t gone according to plan \u2014 yet at least. His offense committed the second-most turnovers per game in December. (P oints allowed per 100 possessions ) The Lakers, who had a top-three Defensive Rating in November, fell out of the top 10. The Clippers\u2019 defense is tumbling despite being in the playoff hunt.

All the Pelicans can do is make it as hard as possible for Davis to leave New Orleans. Part of that, of course, is showing Davis that the Pelicans can compete with the best teams in the Western Conference. And while they did a pretty good job of that last spring, reaching the conference semifinals for the first time in 10 years, things have been tougher this season. The Pelicans have seen the league\u2019s fourth-biggest increase in offensive efficiency, scoring 3.9 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season . But they\u2019ve also seen the fourth-biggest increase in defensive efficiency, allowing 4.5 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season. The Pelicans still have a positive point differential (+0.9 per game, ninth in the Western Conference). But they\u2019ve struggled in close games, going 7-14 (only Cleveland has been worse) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. They\u2019ve also struggled on the road, where they\u2019re 4-15, having lost five straight away from the Smoothie King Center . Entering 2019 in 14th place, there couldn\u2019t be a greater sense of urgency for the Pelicans to turn things around right now. But if they\u2019re going to do that, they\u2019ll have to do it on the road, because they have the most road-heavy January schedule in the Western Conference, with nine of their 14 January games on the road. The Pelicans open the month with five straight games against teams that are at or below .500. They\u2019ll play in Brooklyn on Wednesday and in Cleveland on Saturday before returning home to play the Grizzlies and Cavs. But then they head out on a five-game trip in which they\u2019ll visit five teams ahead of them in the West standings. And after hosting the Pistons on Jan. 23, they\u2019ll finish the month with four games against teams \u2014 Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Houston and Denver \u2014 that have a cumulative winning percentage of .611. The Pelicans aren\u2019t the only Western Conference team that has struggled on the road. But they\u2019re the team that will have to confront their road struggles most often in the next 31 days. And all the games against teams ahead of them in the standings are both a challenge and an opportunity. Rest advantage \/ Rest disadvantage: Games in which one team (at a disadvantage) played the day before and the other (at an advantage) did not. This season, teams are 84-50 (.627) with a rest advantage, 61-25 (.709) at home and 23-25 (.479) on the road. Here\u2019s a breakdown of every Western Conference team\u2019s January schedule\u2026 Some more Western Conference notes: The Indiana Pacers were last year\u2019s surprise team, finishing fifth in the Eastern Conference after trading franchise player Paul George, with Victor Oladipo winning the Kia Most Improved Player award . The Pacers qualify as one of the league\u2019s most surprising teams this year too. Through December, they have the league\u2019s second-best pace-adjusted point differential , having outscored their opponents by 6.4 points per 100 possessions. They\u2019ve been the league\u2019s most improved defensive team, having allowed 5.0 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season . At the start of the season, we thought we had three elite teams \u2014 Boston, Philadelphia and Toronto \u2014 in the Eastern Conference. The Milwaukee Bucks quickly put themselves in that conversation by winning their first seven games, and they remain the only team that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Now, we have to include the Pacers, who currently sit in third place at 25-12 , just a game and a half behind the first-place Bucks. No team has been better at taking care of business. The Pacers have played the league\u2019s easiest schedule through Monday and they\u2019re a league-best 19-2 against the 14 teams that enter 2019 with losing records . Things don\u2019t get much more difficult in January. In regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage, the Pacers have the league\u2019s fourth-easiest January schedule. They also have four rest-advantage games (compared to two rest-disadvantage games). But the Pacers do have four games against the other good teams in the East. They begin 2019 with a five-game road trip that includes stops in Toronto on Sunday and Boston next Wednesday. Then they have a five-game homestand that includes visits from the Sixers (Jan. 17) and Raptors (Jan. 23). The Raptors are one of two East teams (the Hornets are the other) that the Pacers have yet to beat , but they\u2019ll have a rest-advantage in both of those January meetings with Toronto. For another measuring-stick game, the Pacers will get a visit from the champs on Jan. 28. Some more Eastern Conference notes: * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Often it\u2019s the basketball gods who jump in and force your stubborn hand. This explains what happened to John Wall and what should happen as a result to the Washington Wizards. For years, the Wizards resisted any urge to break up a group that couldn\u2019t crack the Eastern Conference elite and showed signs of tapping out. Now, they finally have their chance to push reset. With heel surgery looming, Wall is out for the season . The Wizards are currently a few games better than the starting-from-scratch Atlanta Hawks and therefore headed nowhere special. What more of a hint do they need? Bothered by bone spurs jabbing his Achilles tendon, Wall opted for surgery instead of risking a potential rupture to the tendon. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been there for years,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI\u2019ve played through it, and now it\u2019s to the point where you can\u2019t play through it no more unless you want to tear your whole Achilles. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019m taking the shorter process of taking six to eight months instead of taking 15 to 20 months. \u201cLast year, I had it but it wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t bad but this year, it just got to the point where it was hot a lot of times. You see the Cleveland game, it\u2019d be terrible. I could barely run. And one game it would be good, like the Lakers and those games. I tried as much as I could and to the point where it was getting hotter and hotter. And then if I miss two games and be back a game, then miss two more games, that\u2019s not beneficial to those guys, and it\u2019s not giving my teammates everything I have.\u201d Changing the makeup of this franchise will send hope to the fan base, may put the Wizards in contention for a top pick in a top-heavy 2019 draft, clean up the salary cap if their moves are done properly, and set the table for a new beginning once Wall returns next season. Changes are long overdue anyway and the Wizards now have their opening, their excuse, their chance to do something with minimal blowback. The only real question is whether this should be done by current management or if it\u2019s more of a job for replacements. Ernie Grunfeld is the longest-tenured general manager who hasn\u2019t led his team to at least the conference finals. He was hired in 2003, the same year as Danny Ainge in Boston, and the gap between them is roughly as massive as Wall\u2019s upcoming contract extension (which kicks in next season). Like all GMs, Grunfeld has had decent hits and costly misses in personnel decisions, except his misses seem more pronounced. Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. were all solid lottery picks, but Jan Vesely ( No. 6 in 2011 ) never had a chance. And even with those good picks, the Wizards gave Wall, Beal and Porter massive contracts, with Wall scheduled to make $147 million for the next four seasons as he creeps toward his 30s. (His starting salary next season: $38 million.) The Wizards have the sixth-highest payroll yet entered Monday with the sixth-fewest victories, 14. Grunfeld essentially traded Kelly Oubre Jr. weeks ago because the Wizards were unlikely to pay him next summer. The player they got from the Suns for Oubre, Trevor Ariza, hasn\u2019t been a significant factor yet. The Wall-Beal-Porter core, still young and in its prime, are all good assets on the surface. Wall is an elite point guard with improved outside shooting and has some of the best hands and instincts in the game. Beal is a classic catch-and-shoot player who carries premium value in today\u2019s NBA. Both are All-Stars, while Porter ranked third in 3-point percentage last season. But after advancing to the East semifinals in 2014, \u201915 and \u201917, the Wizards lost to the Raptors in the first round last season and still haven\u2019t won 50-plus games with this core. They\u2019re 28th in defensive rating (they were 15th in that department last season ) and the stench of faulty chemistry seems to linger with this team. With a bleak chance of going deep in the playoffs (if they even reach the postseason), the Wizards can audible and regroup. Here\u2019s what they can explore: Keep Beal: He\u2019s their most marketable player and dozens of teams would be interested in him, but for the Wizards\u2019 sake he\u2019s probably better in their uniform, barring an unexpected blockbuster deal that\u2019s in their favor. Beal is averaging 23.6 points per game on 47.1 percent shooting, and he\u2019s just 25 years old. He\u2019s also signed for two more seasons. While he and Wall were often on the wrong page early in their careers, they\u2019ve developed a workable relationship. When healthy, they\u2019re still among the top backcourts in basketball. Shop Porter: Yes, he has two more years at roughly $55 million total and isn\u2019t having a good year (11.7 ppg). But his touches are likely to increase with Wall out and he still stretches defense. Between now and the trade deadline, Porter could play his way into reasonably decent value, especially to a contender. The only issue is what Washington must take back in return. Part with Ariza: Yes, the Wizards acquired him last month to help stabilize a team in the dumps, but the situation has changed without Wall. The Wizards can\u2019t deal him until Feb. 14, a week after the trade deadline. That could leave a buyout as an option, but will the Wizards pursue that? Find out what Troy Brown Jr. can do: For some reason the swingman-heavy Wizards drafted a swingman in the first round last June. Sure, it\u2019s reasonable to take the best player available, but in the process Brown has fallen through the cracks and hardly plays. With Oubre gone and Ariza perhaps not far behind, the Wizards can begin developing Brown and allowing him to make his mistakes now. Another young player who should see more time is 6-foot-11 Thomas Bryant, who dropped 31 points on the Suns and 21 on the Hornets. The Wizards are better off in the short term by allowing their young players to audition for rotational roles next season. Finally, keep Wall: Not that they have much of a choice. Wall is both injured and pricey, not a great combination for a team holding any visions of seeing what he can fetch. Wall\u2019s injury is similar to the one Mike Conley suffered, and Conley has returned to form with the Grizzlies after missing virtually all last season. So Wall\u2019s issue isn\u2019t career-threatening. Because the Wizards are too financially tied to Wall, Beal, Porter (if he\u2019s not dealt) and Ian Mahinmi (yes) next season, their free-agent options for next summer are slim to none. Their best bet to add help is through the Draft, which makes it more important for them to put themselves in position for a high Draft pick. Which means, losing games. But what better choice do they have? The Draft is expected to bring four or five NBA-ready players, meaning 2019 is the right time to choose high. Wall\u2019s injury gives the Wizards the perfect alibi and opportunity to begin working on 2019-20. If they blow the chance, then their problems and dire outlook will simply rollover to next season. The basketball gods are giving them a warning. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Not the worst situation in the world, but bad enough to incur the wrath of coach Gregg Popovich. Whatever Popovich said and\/or diagrammed worked pretty well as the Spurs responded with their most productive quarter since 1993. Seven members of their roster hadn\u2019t even been born the last time they scored as many in a period as the 46 points they unloaded on the hapless Celtics in the third, paving the way for a 120-111 victory . The Spurs sank 19 of 25 shots (76 percent) in the period, and their point total was 12th-highest among the 16,712 quarters in their history. (For the record, the NBA mark for most points in a single quarter is 58, scored by the team formerly known as the Buffalo Braves against the very same Celtics.) At one point, a frustrated Brad Stevens yelled at his team, \u201cGuard somebody!\u201d  It was a far cry from their miserable start, in which they missed 21 of 27 shots en route to a season-low 17 points in the opening quarter. That improved to 29 in the second period, paving the way for their Tyson-esque upper cut in the third. Amazingly, the Celtics were still in it at that point, cutting the deficit below 10 on multiple possessions in the fourth. But the Spurs, riding their interesting blend of veterans and young prospects, had an answer each time to secure their 10th victory in the past 13 outings. \u201c(Give up a) 46-point third quarter, you\u2019re going to get beat,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey were tremendous. It started with them physically overpowering us, getting to the rim. And once we started really sucking in, then they started spraying it all over and making every shot. They did a great job of exposing us throughout that whole quarter.\u201d James Harden\u2019s Scorched Earth Tour continues. Having averaged 39 points per game over his previous nine outings, Harden outdid himself with 43 points and 13 assists in a 113-101 victory over the Grizzlies. His fourth straight 40-point outing marked only the third time in the past 30 years that a player has scored at least 400 over a 10-game stretch. (The others? Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.) Harden also set an NBA record, previously held by Oscar Robertson, with his eighth straight game of at least 35 points and five assists. \u201cHe\u2019s by far the MVP,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cNobody does what he does on a nightly basis.\u201d Said Austin Rivers, per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon : \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a Kobe, man, that Kobe run (in 2003, when Bryant had nine straight 40-point games). He\u2019s doing it so effortlessly. \u2026 You can\u2019t stop him. He\u2019s going to end up winning this s\u2014 back to back. Nobody in the league can do what he\u2019s doing right now. He\u2019s winning back to back MVPs.\u201d As his assist totals indicate, Harden is doing far more than just score. Indeed, the Rockets\u2019 de facto point guard had a hand in 78 points against the Grizzlies \u2014 absolutely staggering production for a team playing without its second-best player, the injured Chris Paul. Strike that. Thanks to Harden \u2014 who also had 10 rebounds in the 39th triple-double of his career \u2014 the Rockets aren\u2019t just playing, they\u2019re thriving. The Thunder dropped a two-point heartbreaker to the Mavericks on Sunday in which perennial All-Star Russell Westbrook shot a horrific 4-for-22 en route to nine points. He was his own biggest critic afterwards, describing his performance over the past month as, simply, \u201cs\u2014.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to help my guys out,\u201d Westbrook said Sunday night. \u201cI\u2019ve been letting them down, man, just not being consistent on the offensive end. Missing and making shots is a part of the game, but I\u2019ve got to do a better job, and that\u2019s on me. I\u2019m going to definitely do that, so I\u2019m not really worried. We play tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be better from then on. It\u2019s on me.\u201d So how\u2019s this for a response: 32 points on 13-for-24 shooting with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for his 114th career triple-double in a 122-102 rout of those same Mavericks. For good measure, he gifted one lucky fan with the bright pink Nikes off his feet. Myles Turner was arguably the difference in Indiana\u2019s 116-108 victory over the Hawks with 20 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. The most impressive part: He did it in only 23 minutes, his afternoon cut short by a broken nose . Not that he got much sympathy from his teammates. Victor Oladipo, who tied for game-high honors with 22 points, described the injury as \u201cnothing major.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Oladipo added. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right with the mask but he\u2019s going to have to get used to it.\u201d The Pacers hope so, at least. Turner has shaken off a slow start to play some of the best basketball of his young career, averaging 14.4 points, 8.8 rebounds and 3.1 blocks since mid-November. What did the rim ever do to you, Malik Monk? Believe it, young man. That is none other than Wardell Stephen Curry II. https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBA\/status\/1079905602183270402 "},{"id":36554,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hornets-center-cody-zeller-breaks-right-hand","date":"2019-01-01","title":"Hornets center Cody Zeller breaks right hand","content":" Charlotte Hornets center Cody Zeller suffered a broken right hand in Monday\u2019s victory over the Magic, the Hornets confirmed.

Player movement is what gets clicks these days, so the biggest story of the year was LeBron James taking his talent to the Western Conference , leaving Cleveland after four straight trips to The Finals. No major free agents followed him, though. Paul George stayed in Oklahoma City , while disgruntled stars Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler were sent East. On the floor, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 third championship in four years wasn\u2019t much of a surprise, though we can\u2019t forget how close they were to losing to the Houston Rockets in the conference finals , trailing both Games 6 and 7 by double-digits. In the Eastern Conference, the biggest on-the-floor story was the ascension of the Philadelphia 76ers, who quickly went from a decent team in a bad conference (they were in eighth place at 25-25 on the morning of Feb. 5) to title contender over the course of the year, while dealing with two of the most bizarre situations (those of Markelle Fultz and Bryan Colangelo) in recent memory. More drama awaits us in 2019. The free agency and contract-extension decisions of Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard could alter the landscape of the league, and a much-hyped Draft class is on its way. The Warriors still have some business to take care of (and a fifth All-Star to integrate), and the San Antonio Spurs are looking to continue a 21-year playoff streak. As we enter the new year, the Milwaukee Bucks are No. 1 in the Power Rankings, holding the league\u2019s best record and ranking in the top three on both ends of the floor.

Turns no one had, per Elias Sports Bureau and NBA.com\/Stats . Towns\u2019 big night helped the Timberwolves win their third consecutive road game, after a 2-13 road start. It capped a run of three performances by the Wolves center in which he totaled 85 points, 57 rebounds, 16 assists and nine blocks.  Towns\u2019 uptick in play pre-dates the holidays. Since Nov. 12 \u2014 the date Minnesota traded unhappy All-Star Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia \u2014 Towns has averaged nearly 23 points and 13 rebounds, while shooting better than 50 percent. While Butler still was a Timberwolf, Towns averaged 19.9 points and 10.8 rebounds while making 45 percent of his shots. Since Butler has been gone, Towns has been more relaxed and more productive. \u201cHe\u2019s doing great,\u201d teammate Taj Gibson said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken a leadership role. More vocal. We\u2019re doing more and more team activities and he\u2019s one of the main catalysts to that. We\u2019re talking to him, he\u2019s listening. And he wants to win. He wants to do right by the team. We\u2019ve been going to him late in the fourth and he\u2019s been handling it well.\u201d In his fourth NBA season, Towns is back on track. He\u2019s putting up numbers to match his All-Star season in 2018, his defensive work is improving and he has a five-year, $157 million contract extension in his pocket that kicks in come 2019-20. With teammate Andrew Wiggins still confounding fans and critics with his inconsistent effort, Towns is Minnesota\u2019s best player and budding leader, taking baby steps into Butler\u2019s self-proclaimed role. He spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner on the Wolves\u2019 recent stop in Chicago: Steve Aschburner : The Wolves didn\u2019t play on Christmas but you guys traveled to Chicago that night. How do you carve out holiday time when you\u2019re getting squeezed by the schedule? Karl-Anthony Towns : It\u2019s always about the family time. I\u2019m not a guy who\u2019s about the material things. Just having my sister in and her two kids and my mom and dad there. Nice having my niece and nephew around. I told them they didn\u2019t have to come see me, it was only going to be the day. I was planning to wake up late, watch some TV, maybe cook myself and then leave for Chicago. But they came in and wanted to spend some time with me. SA : How do you feel about your team? After a 4-9 start before the Butler trade, you\u2019ve played above .500 ball but still are digging out in the West. KAT : I mean, we\u2019re a team that\u2019s developing still. When you make a trade like we did, obviously, at that point of the season, it hasn\u2019t been that long. Stuff like that happens when you have a training camp, you have time to work on chemistry, everything like that. We\u2019re working on the fly right now. But we\u2019re doing a great job. Even the games we\u2019ve lost, I felt we\u2019ve played well and garnered something. We haven\u2019t taken any steps back. We just have to continue to grind out the season. It\u2019s 82 games for a reason. SA : What did it mean to beat the Thunder in Oklahoma City [ 114-112 on Dec. 23 ]. KAT : That we grinded it [out]. On the road, it wasn\u2019t like we had a good day and the other team had a bad day. We had to grind it to the last second. Especially being at OKC of all places, a team that\u2019s rolling. Gave us a lot of confidence for the road. Learned a lot from that game. SA : Learned what? KAT : It was all about getting one out of the way. We\u2019d been struggling to find one. To be able to go out there and get the one, now we can finally start to see some wins pile up. SA : How have you guys done at getting Dario Saric and Robert Covington acclimated to their new team?  KAT : That\u2019s the thing about Dario and Robert \u2014 they\u2019re such high-character guys, they will always put the team first. Match that with the skill they possess, we\u2019re very happy to have them, very blessed to have \u2018em. What they bring to the table is more than what\u2019s on the stat sheet. SA : It\u2019s got to be difficult, getting air-dropped into a team during the season. KAT : The thing about it is, when you come in, you\u2019re learning a new offensive and defensive scheme, everything. Just having those conversations and people being in their ears about it. But like I said, they\u2019re so possessed with skill, there are times they can get away with winging it. SA : Still?  KAT : It will come with time. Their understanding, us getting more used to them. Great teams, you see players working off of wavelengths. Telepathic, not even actual physical things. We\u2019re not at that point yet but we\u2019re working every day to get there. SA : We always hear about the best players adding something to their games each offseason. What did you bring back from summer? KAT : More just mental than anything. I\u2019ve tried to stay more within, mentally. Be a better person. Be a better leader. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the biggest thing I took away from this summer, working on myself. SA : How much are you trying to assert yourself as a leader here, fours years in? KAT : I\u2019m not as much of a vet as a lot of these guys here. But seeing how hard it was to get to the playoffs last year, seeing what a playoff atmosphere is. Everything like that and seeing what I have in my time playing basketball, it\u2019s more about going out there and \u2026 I think everyone has a hand in leadership. Just accountability. Being there when people count on you the most. And for me, it\u2019s making sure every single day my teammates know I\u2019m here for them, no matter what the case is. Good or bad, I\u2019m going to be on their side regardless. SA : Have you turned up the volume to make your points? KAT : Absolutely. That\u2019s happened multiple times this year. It\u2019s always out of love and respect, but that\u2019s the thing sometimes. Especially when you\u2019re a leader, you have to do the things that aren\u2019t the popular choice. But that\u2019s fine, you have to be able to make those decisions, without a doubt. SA : Is your team looking for you more early in games now, to get you opportunities? KAT : I don\u2019t know. I take what the game gives me. I just go by how the game flows. I want to be aggressive all the time. And do what I can to help us win. SA : There was plenty of focus on the former Bulls \u2014 Derrick Rose, Taj Gibson, coach Tom Thibodeau \u2014 on the Minnesota roster. But you went against a pair of ex-teammates, Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn. How was that? KAT : It\u2019s always a reminder that this is a business. There\u2019s a little more emotion to see those guys you got so close with, and now they\u2019re on another team. You always wish the best for \u2018em. With Kris, with Zach, you want the best for them. You can\u2019t worry about what might have been, though. Whatever\u2019s going to happen is going to happen. SA : Let\u2019s run through some lighter stuff. Tell me about your first dunk. KAT : I was in sixth grade. It was the summer, going into seventh grade. I was 6-foot-something and I\u2019d been playing a lot \u2014 and had gotten close for a couple weeks, I remember vividly. I got out there and thought, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got a chance today.\u201d I went up there and dunked it. My dad went crazy. We had practice later that day, and I couldn\u2019t wait to show how much more I could jump now. I did it again \u2014 once I broke the seal, it was fun. SA : And your first car? KAT : My first car was the only car I\u2019ve got right now. A Range Rover. Why? It\u2019s very snowy in Minnesota. SA : What song do you need to hear at least once a week? KAT :  \u201cBest Day Ever\u201d by Mac Miller . Yeah. I was real close to Mac Miller who died this summer. So I listen to his music, or a song, before every game. He\u2019s been my favorite artist since I was younger. And obviously being close friends with him later in life, his music means more to me than ever. So \u201cBest Day Ever.\u201d BDE. I remember listening to that before every single game in middle school and high school, even in college. SA : Where is your favorite place to go? KAT : Wherever my family is at. My family brings me great energy. SA : What\u2019s the best advice you ever got?  KAT : That was from [Kentucky] coach [John] Calipari actually. It\u2019s what he told our team when we were undefeated. He kept stressing \u2014 and put a big sign in our theater room \u2014 and it was about living in the present. Enjoy this moment, cherish this moment, it will never happen again. For us, our team, we knew we were so good, so talented, one of the best college teams that ever put jerseys on, that we knew it would never happen again. I remember that \u2013 really cherish these moments. Every single day, I try to remember that and conquer every single challenge, relish every single second. SA : This Q&A is posting on New Year\u2019s Eve. So what sort of resolutions have you made or plan to make? KAT : I\u2019ve always tried to make resolutions. Last year I wanted to be mentally stronger. Be more religious, get closer to God, so that was one of my bigger things \u2014 work on things that are bigger than basketball. I wanted to challenge myself to be even more active in communities and charities. That was last year too. I did pretty well \u2014 I can look myself in the mirror and be pretty happy. The thing is, a lot of people look at basketball players as gods, but we\u2019re regular people having everyday struggles like the fans. For me, I want to challenge myself more off the court. It\u2019s about being a better man, more than anything. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

After a nine-point effort (on 4-for-22 shooting) in Sunday\u2019s 105-103 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, Westbrook knows his offensive game has been off of late. Last night\u2019s game marked the fourth time this month that Westbrook has shot less than 25 percent of the field. The Thunder guard flirted with a triple-double as he also notched nine rebounds, eight assists and six steals. But overall, December has been somewhat rough for him. Yes, he\u2019s averaging a triple-double this month (18.1 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 10.4 apg), but he\u2019s also shooting poorly ( 37.2 percent overall and 26.4 percent on 3-pointers with a 40.8 effective field goal percentage ) while doing so. Westbrook wasn\u2019t about to point the finger at others for his struggles, though, after last night\u2019s loss. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to do a better job, man,\u201d Westbrook said, per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u201cIt\u2019s really on me. \u2026 I\u2019ve just got to get focused in and locked back in on what I need to do. I\u2019ve got to help my guys out. I\u2019ve been letting them down, man, just not being consistent on the offensive end. \u201cDefensively, I\u2019m fine, but just being more consistent, because I pride myself on being the most consistent player in the league. I come out every night and compete, play hard and all that stuff. Missing and making shots is a part of the game, but I\u2019ve got to do a better job, and that\u2019s on me. I\u2019m going to definitely do that, so I\u2019m not really worried. We play tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be better from then on. It\u2019s on me.\u201d The Thunder still had a chance to win last night with 1.7 seconds left, but Westbrook missed a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer. Oklahoma City is 8-6 this month and hosts the Mavericks tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) as both it and Westbrook aim to end 2018 on a much stronger note. The Thunder went 12-3 in November and ranked 11th in offensive rating and first in defensive rating that month . Those numbers that have dipped to 20th and fourth, respectively, so far in December . MacMahon notes that Westbrook\u2019s shooting percentage this month is the third-lowest percentage for a month in his career and Westbrook\u2019s worst shooting percentage since December of 2009 ( when he shot 35.7 percent ). Westbrook knows he\u2019s struggling \u2026 but isn\u2019t about to let it consume him, either. \u201cI\u2019ve been in worse positions, man. It\u2019s not the worst thing. We\u2019re third in the West. We\u2019re winning games. It\u2019s not about me,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cMy job is to make sure we win games. I bring so much more to the game of basketball than offense. I defend at a high level, rebound, pass, whatever. I\u2019ll do whatever for us to win games. \u201cSo for me, I\u2019m a basketball player. I\u2019m very, very hard on myself because I\u2019m able to do everything on the floor. And I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s many other guys in the league that play the game the way I do every night, so I pride myself on doing everything at a high level every night. If it\u2019s scoring one night, then it\u2019s assists and rebounding, whatever it is, defending \u2014 I pride myself on doing everything at a high level every single night. I\u2019m going to be tougher on myself than anybody, so I\u2019m not worried one bit.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36647,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-cavaliers-championship-made-me-goat","date":"2018-12-31","title":"LeBron: Cavaliers championship 'made me greatest player of all time'","content":" Debating who\u2019s the greatest player of all time \u2014 AKA \u201cthe GOAT\u201d \u2014 is a favorite pastime of NBA fans. Players as well, apparently, and the choice is clear for LeBron James. It\u2019s him. His reasoning? Being the driving force behind the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 historic championship over the Golden State Warriors in 2016 , a feat that not only secured the city\u2019s first professional sports title since 1964 but completed the first comeback from 3-1 down in Finals history. \u201cThat one right there made me the greatest player of all time,\u201d James said in an excerpt from the latest episode of ESPN\u2019s \u201cMore Than An Athlete\u201d series chronicling his career. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. I was super, super ecstatic to win one for Cleveland because of the 52-year (championship) drought. And then after I stopped (celebrating), I was like, that one right there made you the greatest player of all time. Everybody was talking how they were the greatest team ever assembled, and for us to come back the way we came back, I was like, you did something special. \u201cThat was one of the only times in my career I felt like, you did something special. I haven\u2019t had much time to sit back and think (about my achievements). But that was a moment.\u201d While it may not be the most humble opinion James is offering up, it is impossible to argue the magnitude of James\u2019 performances in each of the last three games of that Finals: * Game 5: 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and three blocks in a 112-97 victory * Game 6:  41 points, eight rebounds, 11 assists, four steals and three blocks in a 115-101 victory * Game 7:  27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists, two steals and three blocks in a 93-89 championship-clinching victory For the series, James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks to secure his third Finals MVP award and third career championship. In that series, he led all Finals players in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, becoming the first player in any playoff series to accomplish that feat. In story posted by Sports Illustrated shortly after that 2016 Finals, James told young players at a camp in Los Angeles that his motivation \u201cis this ghost I\u2019m chasing. The ghost played in Chicago.\u201d That \u201cghost\u201d, of course, is Michael Jordan .

But Karl-Anthony Towns embellished the big double-double with some extras last night, adding six assists, three steals and six blocks as he dominated in the Timberwolves\u2019 113-104 victory over the Heat. He posted 34 points and 18 rebounds, well above his 21.2 ppg and 11.8 rpg season averages. But what set him apart were the defensive stats. Per the Elias Sports Bureau and courtesy of NBA.com\/Stats , a player has not had a combination of those numbers or better in a game since the 1973-74 season. Towns\u2019 performance was only the fifth time in the last 20 years that a player has logged 30-plus points, 15-plus rebounds, five-plus assists and five-plus blocks in a road game. The others accomplishing the feat: Joel Embiid vs. the Lakers in 2017, Tim Duncan vs. the Nuggets in 2012, Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 2004 vs. the Warriors, and Tim Duncan vs. the Trail Blazers in 2003. Equally impressive was Towns\u2019 impact in the fourth quarter when the Heat made a run, cutting the Timberwolves lead to two. Towns, who scored 10 points in the fourth, made a hook shot, then a three-point play and a 3-pointer to put Minnesota back in command. Another young Mav stands tall  Dennis Smith Jr. just turned 21 last month, but he doesn\u2019t have the notoriety of backcourt mate Luke Doncic, who is a teen-aged rookie and the leader in the Kia Rookie of the Year race . Nonetheless, Smith showed his game savvy in the final minute of the Mavericks 105-103 victory over the Thunder. Smith, who finished with 14 points, scored the game-winner on a reverse-course layup, then guarded the much taller Paul George tightly in the ensuing Thunder possession. The game-high scorer was held to a tough fadeaway jumper from the left wing that missed. With 1.7 seconds left, Russell Westbrook came up empty on a corner 3-point attempt and the Mavericks held on for the win. Dallas is getting used to close games. The win was the Mavericks\u2019 sixth straight game decided by four points or less, and they are 2-4 during that stretch. The Mavericks\u2019 win overshadowed another great game for George, who scored 36 points, including the last 13 points for the Thunder despite missing the shot that could have forced overtime. For the second time this season, Evan Fournier has won a game for the Orlando Magic as time expired. This time it was a long running floater from about the foul line to top the Detroit Pistons 109-107 . You may recall that, on Nov. 5, Fournier hit the first game-winning buzzer-beater of the young NBA season, knocking down a 22-footer (his toe was on the 3-point line) that lifted the Magic over the Cleveland Cavaliers 102-100 . Let\u2019s evaluate Sunday night\u2019s game-winner on NBA.com\u2019s Horry Scale: A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Evan Fournier wasn\u2019t having a great night on his way to just 13 points, but when the game was on the line, coach Steve Clifford called his number again. DIFFICULTY: Fournier\u2019s shot wasn\u2019t a long one and defenders were not draped all over him, but it did require creating space with the dribble and finesse. A running floater from 15 feet out is not an easy shot, and Fournier ran cross-court for the inbounds pass, reversed direction toward the key and quickly pushed the floater off the dribble as he curled toward the basket. GAME SITUATION:  The score was tied at 107 -107 with 2.5 seconds left. Before the Magic called timeout, the Pistons\u2019 Reggie Bulloch nailed a 3-pointer to cap a wild comeback in which Detroit cut an eight-point deficit during the final three minutes. But Fournier\u2019s dagger staunched the bleeding and sent the Pistons packing with their 11th lost in their past 15 games CELEBRATION: Fournier stayed in control, exulting a bit verbally but not jumping up and down or fist-pumping as he strutted. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve done this before,\u201d said his demeanor. His teammates mobbed him and the celebration moved toward the Orlando bench. GRADE:  A game-winner is a game-winner. But given the midseason status of the game and the ease with which Fournier broke free from the defense (who else would be likely to take the final shot?), this buzzer-beater gets 2 1\/2  Horrys .  C.J. McCollum and the Trail Blazers got off to a quick start \u2014 McCollum scored 26 points in the first half \u2014 and never looked back in a 129-95 win over the Sixers , who shot poorly and did not have center Joel Embiid. Embiid was held out as a precaution with a sore knee, and the Blazers outrebounded the Sixers 59 to 36, led by Al-Farouq Aminu (8), Josef Nurkic (7) and Meyers Leonard (8) and Caleb Swanigan (7) off the bench. The shooting percentages were just as one-sided. The Trail Blazers were 12-22 from beyond the arc \u2014 including four 3-pointers by McCollum on seven attempts \u2014 while the Sixers were an abysmal 8-of 43, 18.6 percent. McCollum finished with 35 points in a break out of his recent shooting woes. In his last six games, he had shot 16 percent from beyond the arc. Faced with the possibility of going 0-3 since LeBron James went down with a strained groin, the young Lakers coalesced around Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (season-high 26 points), Josh Hart (22), and Brandon Ingram (21) and stood tall in the final minutes to take a 121-112 victory over the Kings. The Lakers finished the game on a 18-4 run. It was the second meeting of the two teams in four nights. On Thursday, Sacramento won on a 3-pointer by Bogdan Bogdanovic at the buzzer.

In fact, Jordan scored 25 ppg or more in 12 of his 15 seasons. Starting on March 25, 1986, Jordan showed off his consistency as a go-to scorer. From that date forward, Jordan scored double-digit points in every game until late 2001.

He might not be the most aesthetically-pleasing player in the NBA. But his immense production speaks for itself. The reigning Kia MVP turned in the latest chapter in the hottest stretch of his career on Saturday, erupting for 41 points in the Rockets\u2019 108-104 victory over the Pelicans. It marked: * Harden\u2019s third straight 40-point game, matching Moses Malone for the longest streak in franchise history * Harden\u2019s seventh straight 35-point game, tying the 11th-longest streak in NBA history * Harden\u2019s seventh straight 35-point, five-assist game, matching Oscar Robertson for the longest streak in NBA history \u201cI just try to continue to be aggressive and have confidence in my shots and the things I do on the court,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I play for, to be mentioned with the greats. That\u2019s what I put my jersey on for and lace up my shoes for, to be the best I can be when it\u2019s all said and done.\u201d So far, so good. More importantly for the Rockets (20-15), Harden\u2019s outburst led to their ninth victory in the past 10 games as they pulled into fifth place in the Western Conference. They\u2019ve also won four straight since Chris Paul was sidelined with a strained hamstring, an injury that threatened to derail what has already been a challenging season for a Rockets squad that didn\u2019t lose their 15th game last season until April 1. Back to Harden: Tack on a three-point loss to Dallas on Dec. 8, and he\u2019s averaging an incredible 39 points over his past 11 outings. Small wonder that Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry called Harden arguably the best isolation player in league history before tipoff. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody is better, really, as far as drawing fouls and making plays in \u2018iso\u2019 situations,\u201d he said.  Harden promptly made Gentry\u2019s case for him with 26 points in the first half, and scoring or assisting on a total of 55 \u2014 a magnificent performance that the very best manage to look routine. \u201cAnother 40 points \u2026 that\u2019s incredible,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cObviously, I get to see him every night, but you don\u2019t get better than what he does offensively. He does a lot . Somebody said the other day we can only win if he scores 40. OK, that\u2019s kind of a bad thing. But the good thing is, he can score 40 every night.\u201d Harden\u2019s 40-spot was one of four in the NBA, marking the first time since April 2017 that such an event has occurred. The other standouts were: * Kemba Walker, who scored 47 in the Hornets\u2019 130-126 loss to the Wizards * Jamal Murray, who scored 46 in the Nuggets\u2019 122-118 victory over the Suns * Damian Lillard, who scored 40 in the Blazers\u2019 115-105 loss to the Warriors Footnote: LaMarcus Aldridge just missed making it five in one night for only the fourth time in NBA history, torching the Clippers for 38 as the Spurs triumphed 122-111 at Staples Center. Nets center Jarrett Allen joined an exclusive fraternity when he became just the eighth player to ever block a LeBron James dunk attempt earlier this month. He added yet another star to his list of victims in an afternoon matinee against the Bucks, denying superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo with another fearless block. Giannis ultimately had his revenge, however, throwing down a pair of transition dunks later in the quarter and finishing with his third triple-double of the season as the Bucks won 129-115 . It\u2019s been a rough season for Warriors sharpshooter Klay Thompson. A career 41.6-percent 3-point shooter, who had never shot less than 40.1 percent from range in any of his previous seven campaigns, Thompson entered Saturday\u2019s contest with the Blazers hitting just 33.3 percent on 3s. So, as he proceeded to torch the Blazers for 32 points and four 3s, it was only fitting he gave thanks. To his hand. One could scarcely have played much better than Kyrie Irving did in the fourth quarter against the Grizzlies, scoring or assisting on 22 of the Celtics\u2019 last 25 points to deliver a 112-103 victory in which they trailed by 19. Having totaled just four points and six assists in the first half, Irving finished with 26 and 13 for his third straight double-double. Given where the game was played, it was entirely fitting that Knicks coach Dave Fizdale evoked a snowslide to describe his squad\u2019s 129-97 beatdown at the hands of the Jazz. \u201dThey came out with force and we came out dead,\u201d he said. \u201dWe had no legs, no life \u2013 nothing. We couldn\u2019t make shots. We couldn\u2019t get stops. It was just a total avalanche.\u201d Indeed, the Jazz needed just seven minutes to build a double-digit lead. With seconds left in the first half, it sat at a staggering 40 points, and never dipped below 22 the rest of the way as nine Jazz players finished with at least eight points. For our money, there are few highlights in the NBA better than an emphatic, athletic putback slam. Hawks forward John Collins and Celtics forward Jayson Tatum treated us to some exquisite examples, tracking in from the 3-point line as if compelled by gravitational pull and rising well above the rim to crank home misses.

The Wizards announced Saturday night that the five-time All-Star will undergo the surgery in Green Bay, Wisconsin sometime in the next few days. Wall was told earlier Saturday that surgery was the best option, and he and the team conferred hours later before a final decision was made. \u201dI\u2019ve been with him for almost three years,\u201d Brooks said. \u201dHe\u2019s as tough as they come. He never complained. He wanted to compete for his team, but it got to a point where he had to make some tough decisions. And that\u2019s why he met with a specialist.\u201d Wall has yet to address the surgical option publicly. He walked through the Wizards\u2019 locker room Saturday night with a gray protective boot on his left foot. The Wizards tried to manage his pain situation by limiting him in some practices and shootarounds, but rest is no longer the best option. \u201dHe\u2019s a great talent,\u201d Charlotte coach James Borrego said. \u201dGreat player.\u201d Wall went to Wisconsin to see Green Bay Packers associate team physician Dr. Robert Anderson on Saturday. Surgery and other options were discussed at that meeting with Anderson, who is considered an elite doctor when it comes to athletes dealing with foot and ankle problems \u2013 as evidenced by a client list that has included, among others, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Derek Jeter. Wall played in 32 of Washington\u2019s 36 games this season entering Saturday, averaging 20.7 points and 8.7 assists even while dealing with the heel pain \u2014 which has been an issue for him many times over the past two to three years. But the Wizards have struggled this season, with the 24th-best record in the 30-team NBA to this point, and losing Wall is obviously a significant blow. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing the right things, you can withstand all storms thrown at you,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd our guys are going to do the right things.\u201d Wall was limited to 41 games last season, mostly because of surgery on his left knee. He also underwent surgeries on both knees in 2016. His absence means the Wizards \u2014 who have a slew of other injury woes \u2014 are now without the point guard and center that they envisioned having when the season began. Dwight Howard has been limited to nine games because of lumbar surgery, and is likely to be out for another couple months at least. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win games,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to make excuses. I\u2019ve never made an excuse as a player, and I\u2019ve never made one as a coach, and I\u2019m not going to start now. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like that our center is out, I don\u2019t like that if it happens that our point guard is out. It\u2019s not a good combination to have.

The Pelicans outlasted the Mavericks 114-112 , with the cornerstones for both clubs putting on a show. All-Star forward Anthony Davis dropped a season-high 48 points and 17 rebounds for New Orleans, while talented rookie Luka Doncic went off for a career-high 34 points and seven 3-pointers in Dallas\u2019 loss. As scintillating as the battle was, was more thrilling action left on the table? Down 111-109 with 1:18 left in the fourth quarter, the Mavericks turned to Doncic, who drained a deep 3-pointer for the lead over All-Defensive first team member Jrue Holiday. Moments later, Davis\u2019 three-point play \u2014 a fall-away jumper from the baseline plus free throw \u2014 gave New Orleans the 114-112 lead. With four seconds left and the Mavericks down by two, everyone watching couldn\u2019t be faulted for assuming the ball would wind up in the hands of Doncic. Instead, the play design didn\u2019t appear to feature the Slovenian rookie at all \u2014 the inbounds pass went to second-year guard Dennis Smith Jr., who didn\u2019t get a shot off before time expired, leaving Doncic noticeably frustrated. Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle stepped into the decision after the game. \u201cI take responsibility for the last play,\u201d per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u201cThat\u2019s on me, the fact that it was unsuccessful.\u201d Doncic\u2019s nascent NBA career has been replete with clutch shots \u2014 he\u2019s currently shooting 55 percent from the field and 41 percent from deep during the last five minutes of games within five points. Out of the 12 players with at least 60 points in clutch time \u2014 a list that includes James Harden, LeBron James and Kevin Durant \u2014 the early Rookie of the Year frontrunner has been the most efficient. With the ball not touching his hands for the last shot on Friday, it feels as though we may have been robbed of another memorable \u201cHalleluka\u201d moment. Nonetheless, the Pelicans snapped their five-game losing streak behind a monster game from Davis. The prodigious power forward showed everyone why he\u2019s so coveted (it was reported earlier in the day that the league sent a memo to teams subtly saying to stop tampering with him). He now has nine career games with at least 45 points and 15 rebounds, the most since the NBA\/ABA merger in 1976-77. Shaquille O\u2019Neal is next with seven games of its kind. Doncic, at 19 years old, became the youngest player in NBA history to make seven 3-pointers in a game. *Programming Note: Mavericks vs. Pelicans re-airs on NBA TV at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday * Bringing out the receipts  Players present their quibbles to referees during breaks rather frequently, but it\u2019s not often they provide the official with film on a tablet.

Now that we\u2019re past the \u2018unofficial\u2019 start of the season with Christmas Day in the rear-view mirror, it\u2019ll be interesting to see which challengers step forward. Meanwhile, the King receives the first dent in his armor in the form of a groin injury . But that won\u2019t likely be enough to slow him down or allow for anyone else to break through the gate. ATHO. LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: ATHO Latest stats: 6 games, 22.3 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 8.0 apg Season stats: 27.3 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 7.1 apg A strained groin has ended James\u2019 consecutive games streak at 156. The Lakers will be extra cautious, electing to sit him for \u2018several games.\u2019 Yet it\u2019s still difficult to see the King losing his spot if he misses three, five or even 10 games. Before the injury, James had secured four straight double-doubles including a triple-double. ________________________________________________________ 1. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 6 games, 20.7 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 18.9 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 2.1 apg After struggling at the start the season, Aldridge has found his comfort zone while helping the Spurs go 8-2 in their last 10. Aldridge has managed five games of 20 or more points in the last seven while shooting a blistering 58.1 percent from the field. All this while averaging fewer than 30 minutes per game, which comes out to 28.2 points per 48 minutes on the season. 2. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 7 games, 15.6 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 5.4 apg Season stats: 16.2 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.3 apg Gasol was unspectacular over the last seven, but just good enough to hold off Redick for the No. 2 spot. Yes, the veteran center managed to score 15 or more in four of those games, but went for 20 or more once. Gasol also posted double-digit rebounds in one game while failing to shoot better than 50 percent from the field in four straight games. 3. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 7 games, 18.4 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 2.6 apg Season stats: 18.2 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.9 apg Another solid stretch has Mr. Steady thisclose to overtaking Gasol. In his last three games, Redick has scored 17 or more points, connected on four or more 3-pointers and shot better 58 percent in two of the three. He continues to score at a career-best 18.2 ppg, reaching double figures in all 36 games this season. 4. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 4 games, 20.3 ppg, 1.5 rpg, 7.5 apg Season stats: 17.6 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 4.9 apg After missing four games with a hamstring injury, Williams returned in a big way \u2014 scoring 24 or more in three of four games in just 22 minutes per game. If that\u2019s not enough, he shot an impressive 56.5 percent from the field, 60.0 from deep and contributed six or more assists in all four games. Williams just might be the Clippers\u2019 most important player. 5. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 1 game, 20 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 5.0 apg Season stats: 14.4 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 9.8 apg Lowry has been battling back\/thigh injuries that has forced him to miss five of the last six games. The one game he was able to suit up for went OK (20 points on 6-for-16 shooting, six rebounds and five assists). The nagging injuries could help explain his uneven production over the last three weeks. 6. Marvin Williams (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 6 games, 13.3 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.2 apg Season stats: 9.6 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 1.0 apg Welcome to the race, new face. After starting the season with just four double-digit scoring games in the first 17 games, Williams has produced six such games in the last nine as well as connecting on three or more 3s. In fact, he\u2019s matching his career best (2015-16) of 1.9 3-pointers made per game. 7. Trevor Ariza (33), Washington Wizards Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 5 games, 14.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 3.4 apg Season stats: 10.6 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 3.4 apg All Ariza has done since his trade from Phoenix is post double-digit scoring games in four of five, with no total dipping below 14. The shooting has been off lately (36.2 FG%, 31.7 3PT%), but he\u2019s still managed to hit multiple 3s in three of five and at least three steals in four of five, including a season-high six in his first game with the Wizards. 8. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 4 games, 11.5 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 7.8 apg Season stats: 15.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 8.0 apg Paul has missed the last three games and will be sidelined at least two weeks with a hamstring injury. It could be hard to see him holding down a spot on the list much longer. In four games before the injury, Paul was hit-and-miss, shooting 3-for-10 in three games and 7-for-11 in the other. He did, however, manage eight or more assists in three of four. 9. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 9 Latest stats: 6 games, 13.3 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 14.0 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.4 apg Gay\u2019s streak of double-digit scoring games came to an end at 10 after Wednesday\u2019s six-point effort. Outside of that, he was fairly consistent, putting up between 12-21 points in the other five games. Gay also grabbed six or more boards in five of six and shot better than 50 percent from the field in four. 10. J.J. Barea (34), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: 10 Latest stats: 5 games, 13.4 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 6.8 apg Season stats: 11.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 5.6 apg The good: 18 points on 7-for-13 shooting Wednesday and 19 points in 8-for-15 shooting on Dec. 20. The bad: nine points on 2-for-9 Sunday and 10 points on 4-for-11 on Dec. 18. It certainly has been a mixed bag for Barea, who continues to provide sparks here and there despite averaging just 23.4 minutes.

Rondo sprained his finger during Los Angeles\u2019 Christmas Day victory at Golden State. He missed the Lakers\u2019 last-second loss at Sacramento on Thursday night along with LeBron James, who strained his groin against the Warriors. Rondo had surgery Friday, and he is expected to fully recover in four to five weeks, according to the team. The Lakers face the Clippers on Friday night in the first game of the season against their Staples Center co-tenants. The Lakers (20-15) have vaulted back into playoff contention with the Western Conference\u2019s fifth-best record, a half-game behind the Clippers (20-14). Rondo is averaging 8.4 points, 6.7 assists and 4.4 rebounds while providing solid leadership in his first season with the Lakers, who signed him as a free agent in July. But the veteran has appeared in only 14 games because of a three-game suspension for fighting and a 17-game absence after breaking a bone in his right hand, an injury that also required surgery. He only returned from his broken hand Dec. 21, playing in three games in five days before getting hurt again. Lonzo Ball is likely to remain the Lakers\u2019 starting point guard in Rondo\u2019s absence. Brandon Ingram also assumes a larger playmaking role without Rondo or James.

The two L.A. teams who share the building will meet for the first time this season. The young Lakers will be without their superstar leader \u2014 LeBron James, still nursing a strained groin \u2014 and the Clippers bring a scrappy group that\u2019s resourceful without a true star. Those are the credentials that give each a measure of pride; the Lakers are suddenly vibrant again since LeBron\u2019s arrival while the Clippers\u2019 nearly identical record gives them a sense of satisfaction and pride for doing more with less. Their first \u201ccontest,\u201d however, must wait until next summer, when victory will go deeper than the standings. The Lakers and Clippers will each have massive room under the salary cap and, therefore, ample chances to chase A-list free agents in what will be a limited market for superstars, surely pitting one team against the other in most if not all cases. Lakers vs. Clippers? Is this the one-sided arm wrestle that it appears to be strictly from a historical standpoint, or will the Clippers make this more suspenseful than anyone would\u2019ve imagined? Yes, a decade ago in such a situation, the only glance that a franchise player would shoot in the direction of the Clippers would be a side-eye. Former Clipper Ron Harper once joked that whenever strangers asked which team he played for, he\u2019d answer \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d which meant he wasn\u2019t lying, and also meant he probably wouldn\u2019t be heckled. But those Clippers, long the butt of jokes, constantly mismanaged, perpetually dealing with doses of bad luck and ruled by the one and only Donald Sterling, are six feet under. Whether they\u2019re still dealing with the ghosts of the past and outdated images of buffoonery will be determined by their skill in free agency. In fact, the case could be made that the franchise is in better shape, from an all-around standpoint, than at any time in their history. Yes, that\u2019s quite a statement, considering the Clippers had Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin all in their prime and for over half a decade, and that crew was coached by Doc Rivers, who\u2019s still at the helm. But those Clippers, mayors of Lob City, mainly teased. They never went anywhere special (no conference finals, no NBA Finals) and arguably underachieved from a bottom-line standpoint. Entertaining and interesting? Sure. Box office? Yes. Successful from October through April? Absolutely. Yet, in the end, duds. Plus, with all due respect to Rivers, who also handled the personnel duties until two summers ago, the Clippers never pulled off a franchise-changing move to supplement their All-Star core and give them a leg up on the competition. These Clippers are in good shape on the court and great shape on the salary cap, which is bringing the flexibility of a gold medal gymnast. They don\u2019t have LeBron to entice free agents, and maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Maybe that actually works to their advantage. Clippers to A-lister: Why play next to LeBron when you can be our LeBron and help put your own team together? The Clippers have enough room to sign two lead singers if they rescind their \u201cBird rights\u201d on leading scorer Tobias Harris, who\u2019s only 26: For example, imagine Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard to get the conversation started. And what\u2019s best is they wouldn\u2019t have to gut the team. They have enough players either on team-friendly contracts or rookie contracts to stick around: Montrezl Harrell, a worker bee who\u2019s improved; Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a wise point guard at age 20; and Lou Williams, a scorer who\u2019s comfortable coming off the bench. They could also exceed the cap to re-sign Harris. To recap, the Clippers have money, Rivers as coach, good players to surround a star, a loaded owner in Steve Ballmer, all the LA perks enjoyed by the Lakers. Everything except tradition and Jack Nicholson. Is that necessarily a deal breaker? And wouldn\u2019t the Clippers qualify as a bolder challenge for a superstar than riding shotgun with LeBron for a franchise already with 16 titles? You could picture someone like Durant, searching for a team to call his own, anxious to add something special to his legacy, taking the bait. Maybe Leonard, too, who\u2019s from the Pasadena area. And also Jimmy Butler, who spends his offseasons in LA. However, the Lakers\u2019 footprint in LA is so massive that it must be respected. Hard to say no to Magic Johnson and LeBron, a pair of certified winners and all-timers. LeBron is the most unselfish scorer the game has ever seen. He dominates the ball but doesn\u2019t overwhelm it. Every major co-star, from Dwyane Wade to Chris Bosh to Kyrie Irving, won championships next to LeBron. And in this late stage of his career, he\u2019d probably be more willing than ever to share the ball, the wealth, the load, whatever, just to grab another ring before walking out the door for good. Plus, the Lakers have assets on rookie deals: Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Brandon Ingram\u2019s contract comes up for renewal next summer, so that\u2019s trickier. No matter; point is, any incoming free agent will have help besides LeBron. The wild card is Anthony Davis and whether he forces his way out of New Orleans next summer by refusing to extend his current deal, which runs through 2019-20, with a player option for 2020-21. The Pelicans would either keep Davis until the contract is up, hoping his changes his mind in the process, or trade him. Short of squeezing the Pelicans for Davis, the Lakers will be anxious to add help because LeBron, who turns 34 in a few days, is on the clock even though it doesn\u2019t reflect in his play right now. So those are the choices for the impatient free agent star looking for a change of scenery and wanting to relocate to Los Angeles. It\u2019s Lakers or Clippers, the chance to be next to LeBron or be away from his shadow, start a new legacy for a franchise or add to a franchise that\u2019s already rich. Two Los Angeles teams meet Friday in a game, months before the \u201ccontest\u201d that will dictate their future and direction. Next year\u2019s first game between these two will tell us how their summer went. * * * * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

With the Boston Celtics\u2019 season at an early crossroad, of sorts, it was Irving who stepped into the leadership void to steer things in the right direction. With injuries to key players complicating matters and chemistry issues still being sorted out, Irving was the veteran willing to step up and speak out in an effort to make sure the Celtics dealt with their issues head on. The Celtics had an inconsistent start to the season (10-10) before going on a eight-game win streak that was more like what was expected of them, only to hit the skids again briefly and lose three straight games before Irving piped up . \u201cI think everyone can see that we\u2019ve obviously had some inconsistencies regarding our play,\u201d he said, \u201cso I think it was just time to address it.\u201d A 36-minute players meeting in the locker room after a Dec. 21 home thumping from Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks was enough for Irving, who didn\u2019t spare anyone (himself included) from the harsh spotlight. It was a cathartic moment for the Celtics, who saw Al Horford return from a seven-game absence just in time for Sunday\u2019s win in Charlotte. Kyrie was at his superstar best with the bright lights shining on Christmas. He torched the Philadelphia 76ers for 40 points, unleashing his full offensive arsenal (shooting 17-for-33 from the floor, 5-for-10 from deep), while also grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out three assists. He was in showtime mode again Thursday night against James Harden and the Houston Rockets at Toyota Center, finishing his night with 23 points, 11 assists, five rebounds and just one turnover. The Celtics simply had no answer for Harden, who like Irving moves up the ranks on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. But it\u2019s clear Irving is ready to shoulder the burden of leading these Celtics, in whatever way necessary. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.4 points, 12.8 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.3 steals Antetokounmpo turned Madison Square Garden into his very own Christmas playground when he smoked the Knicks for 30 points, 14 rebounds, four steals, three assists and two blocks to kick off the league\u2019s showcase day. And just so the Knicks know it wasn\u2019t a fluke, he hurried them again Thursday night at Fiserv Forum with 31 points, 14 rebounds, eight assists and four blocks in another rout. The Greek Freak is making it tough for anyone to nudge him from the top spot on this list; he\u2019s averaging 24.8 points (on 60.9 shooting), 12.6 rebounds 5.6 assists and 1.7 blocks in his last 10 games. The Bucks are cruising during this stretch as well, solidifying their position as one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference and the entire league at the close of the calendar year 2018. If this is just the warm up for 2019, Antetokounmpo can really crank up his MVP campaign between now and the All-Star break. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.8 steals Leonard and the Raptors didn\u2019t get an opportunity to showcase themselves for the world to see on Christmas but made up for that scheduling snafu with an instant classic in a win over Miami on the day after the holiday. Leonard scored 30 points, grabbed eight rebounds and had two assists and two steals in the winning effort. December has been good to the Raptors\u2019 prized summer acquisition \u2014 he\u2019s averaging 30.1 points (on .520 shooting) to go along with his 8.1 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.0 steals. For all of the chatter about how good the Raptors have been with Leonard out of the lineup and how good their quality depth is and has been all season, the fate of this team rests on Leonard\u2019s broad shoulders come playoff time. He\u2019s the one element they\u2019ve lacked in previous runs, as a true crunch-time, go-to player in the postseason. All that noise about him not being an ideal vocal leader looks like just that at this stage of his tenure in Toronto. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 7.1 assists, 1.3 steals Lakers Nation held its collective breath earlier this week, awaiting the word on LeBron\u2019s MRI after he heard a \u201cpop\u201d when he went down in the third with a groin injury in the third quarter of the Lakers\u2019 Christmas Day blowout over the Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena. The news was better than expected but the catalyst for the Lakers\u2019 revival this season is still expected to miss \u201cseveral games.\u201d This could actually prove to be a critical stretch for the Lakers. If they can manage to maintain their position in the Western Conference standings without LeBron in uniform, it\u2019ll speak volumes about the growth and development of their youngsters. It will also instill some confidence in the entire group if they can piece together a few wins without the new king of Los Angeles. All that said, it would be shortsighted of anyone to dismiss the work LeBron has put in during the early-season turnaround this team has undergone. He was playing as well as anyone in the league this month (25.8 points on .516 shooting, 9.3 rebounds, 8.2 assists and 1.3 steals). Last week:   No. 4 Season stats:  28.6 points, 5.2 assists, 5.0 rebounds, 1.3 steals Curry bounced back from yet another uncharacteristic Christmas Day performance (just 15 points on an ugly 5-for-17 shooting) with a big night against his brother Seth and the Portland Trail Blazers. But his 29 points and a triple-double from Kevin Durant wasn\u2019t enough to lift the Warriors past Damian Lillard\u2019s late-game heroics against his hometown team. If there was ever a time to be concerned about Curry and these Warriors, it\u2019s now. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson cannot find their marks. The bench production is non-existent at times. And the edge the Warriors have used to their advantage for years seems to have vanished. The boost they need is more than just adding a superstar talent like Boogie Cousins (whose recovery from his Achilles injury seems to be in hyperdrive). The Warriors might need both Curry and Durant to go off script a bit and shake things up by going nuclear offensively to strike fear in teams the way this team once did. They\u2019ve become far too predictable a target without the proper support from their other stars. Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  32.3 points, 8.4 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 2.1 steals The reigning Kia MVP will not be denied any longer. Harden has been on an absolute tear of late and is bringing the Rockets back into focus in the Western Conference playoff chase while doing so. He\u2019s posted back-to-back 40 point games (45 in Thursday\u2019s showdown win over the Boston Celtics and 41 in the Christmas Day win over the Oklahoma City Thunder). He\u2019s currently on a career-best eight-game run scoring 30 or more points, the first player to do so since Russell Westbrook did it in November of 2016. Harden\u2019s the first to score 35 or more in six straight games since former teammate Carmelo Anthony accomplished the feat in April of 2013. Harden\u2019s eight games of 40 or more points this season leads the league (Anthony Davis is second with five). The Celtics tried every player in uniform to stop him but to no avail. But Harden\u2019s best work has been pulling the Rockets out of their sub-.500 hole at Thanksgiving to a season-best four games over .500 as they close out the 2018 portion of their schedule.

James was injured during the Lakers\u2019 127-101 victory over two-time defending NBA champion Golden State on Christmas when he slipped while going for a loose ball. An MRI showed that James suffered a left groin strain rather than a tear, but no timetable has been set for his return.

His last extended absence due to injury was an eight-game stint to deal with back and knee aches midway through the 2014-15 season. James is averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists this season, his 16th in the NBA and first with the Lakers."},{"id":36698,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-12-27-2018","date":"2018-12-28","title":"About Last Night: Bogdan's big one","content":" It\u2019s been rough sledding in general for the Kings, owners of the NBA\u2019s longest current playoff drought. Their draft history hasn\u2019t been much better, yielding just one All-Star (DeMarcus Cousins) out of 12 lottery picks since 2007 (not including Marvin Bagley). Sacramento (19-16) finally appears to be righting its magnificently askew ship, and it\u2019s recent turn in draft investment is the catalyst of their turnaround. De\u2019Aaron Fox is blossoming far sooner than many predicted. Willie Cauley-Stein is holding his own as a starting big man. Bagley is already an efficient scorer off the bench. Yet the Kings\u2019 most shrewd Draft-day move may have been trading out  of the lottery in 2016 for three less valuable picks and the rights to draft-and-stash prospect Bogdan Bogdanovic. When he came to the NBA last season, the former EuroLeague standout was already a professional veteran with game-winners, regular season and postseason awards under his belt. That\u2019s why the Kings didn\u2019t hesitate to call Bogdanovic\u2019s number when facing a two-point deficit to the LeBron-less Lakers in the closing seconds on Friday night . Bogdanovic rewarded their confidence with a move he\u2019d already executed multiple times overseas: dribble, step-back, nothing but net. How should this rate on NBA.com\u2019s Horry Scale? A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. DIFFICULTY : Sacramento ran some brilliant high off-ball screen action that ultimately forced Lakers big man Tyson Chandler to switch onto Bogdanovic. The former EuroLeague champ immediately settled into a rythmn dribble before stepping back and canning the fading 3-pointer. It was by no means an easy shot, but he couldn\u2019t have asked for a better matchup. GAME SITUATION : With 4.3 seconds remaining, Bogdanovic wasn\u2019t completely pressed beyond his comfort zone. Zoom out, however, and this was a must-win for a plateauing Kings team set to face Portland, Denver and Golden State to start the new year. CELEBRATION : Boganovic has always been a fiery competitor, and that personality was on fall display the second his shot went in. The Serbian swingman went into full-throated and defiant celebration mode before being mobbed by his teammates. GRADE : Turning around a franchise\u2019s collective mojo is no easy feat. The Kings are one of the season\u2019s early feel-good stories, but even they need moments to fuel their internal belief. Bogdanovic gave them one they won\u2019t forget for a while. Four Horrys .  Ice-cold brothers  It was that kind of night for Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, who combined for a frigid 17-for-45 shooting night \u2014 which doesn\u2019t include their 2-for-7 performance from the free throw line. We thought the Warriors hit their low when Thompson took an errant pass from Draymond Green right to the face. That moment was later upstaged by the most unlikely of gaffes from Curry. With 17.1 seconds remaining in overtime, the two-time Kia MVP turned the ball over on an inbounds pass, leading to Damian Lillard\u2019s latest edition of Dame Time \u2014 and the Blazers\u2019 110-109 win at Oakland. Nothing is more frightening than two nearly 7-foot and extremely muscular human beings getting mad at one another and\u2026 angrily touching foreheads. In all seriousness, kudos to officials and teammates for breaking up a tense moment in what was otherwise another solid win for the second-place Bucks. Last year\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Year race featured some no-so-subtle give and take between Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell. Though the two are no longer rookies, it was clear very early on Friday that each was especially fueled by the other. Simmons left Salt Lake City with the 114-97 victory thanks in part to his triple-double of 13 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. The former No. 1 overall pick is now 4-0 all-time against Mitchell (23 points, four rebounds, three steals), who has now shot above 40 percent in three consecutive games for the first time since Oct. 31.

He changed addresses again, leaving his Cleveland home for the second time to join the Los Angeles Lakers in the biggest move of free agency over the summer. He remained arguably the dominant player in the basketball, adding even more glitz on a legacy that reached epic status long ago. It was, by any measure, a fantastic year for James. And even without a title, it may have been his most significant year. For the third time, James has been selected as The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year \u2013 after 2018 saw him continue to excel on the court, open the \u201cI Promise\u201d school for at-risk children in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, and further use his voice as an activist who bristled at being told to \u201cshut up and dribble.\u201d \u201cI would describe it as a success because I was able to inspire so many people throughout the year,\u201d James said. \u201cI got to go back to China, to Paris, to Berlin, I opened up a school. And all these kids I was able to see, all over the world and in my hometown, I was able to inspire, to make them think they can be so much more than what they think they\u2019re capable of being. That was my outlook for 2018.\u201d James received 78 points in balloting by U.S. editors and news directors announced Thursday, while Boston Red Sox star Mookie Betts was second with 46. Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals was third, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was fourth and Triple Crown winner Justify was fifth. On the court, James remained dominant. He averaged 28.7 points, 8.8 rebounds and 8.4 assists in 2018 between his time with the Cavaliers and Lakers, playing in 102 games through Thursday. \u201cIn addition to being on everyone\u2019s short list as one of the league\u2019s all-time greatest players, LeBron is among the hardest working players and is a thoughtful and impactful leader,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cHe serves on the executive committee of the Players Association even as he builds an impressive media company of his own. And what\u2019s most inspiring, and no surprise given his talent and focus, is how he\u2019s done all of this while embracing his unique opportunity to positively impact communities in need.\u201d James becomes the third man to win the award at least three times, joining Lance Armstrong (a four-time winner from 2002 through 2005), Tiger Woods (1997, 1999, 2000 and 2006) and Michael Jordan (1991, 1992 and 1993). Armstrong won the Tour de France in each of his years as the AP recipient, \u2013 though he was later stripped of the titles in a doping scandal. Woods won at least one major and was the PGA\u2019s Player of the Year in all four of his AP-winning years. Jordan\u2019s three awards coincided with his first three NBA championships in Chicago. And James\u2019 first two times getting the award were in 2013 and 2016, years where his fingerprints mussed up the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in a title celebration. And James\u2019 closest rivals in the AP balloting this year \u2013 Betts and Ovechkin \u2013 also won titles in 2018. James\u2019 year included no championship, no scoring title, no MVP award. But some of the people closest to James still considered 2018 to be his finest year yet. \u201cI like to talk about generations,\u201d said Miami guard Dwyane Wade, one of James\u2019 best friends. \u201cThere will never be another Michael Jordan because he was the first to be a global superstar, the first to take the NBA to another level. There will never be another LeBron James, and a lot of it is from what he\u2019s done away from the game. Him understanding his voice has been so refreshing and so important to the culture and his friends.\u201d The \u201cI Promise\u201d school is perhaps James\u2019 most prized accomplishment yet. It opened in July for 240 third- and fourth-graders, a public school in Akron that is perhaps like none other. Families \u2013 not just the kids \u2013 get support there, whether it\u2019s by helping put food on the table or providing adult education or even legal assistance. And this is just the start. James and his LeBron James Family Foundation have enormous plans for the school in the years ahead. \u201cIt is already such a success,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that I never thought was possible until we made it happen. So yes, it\u2019s been a pretty good year.\u201d A busy year, too. He had a documentary series called \u201cShut Up and Dribble,\u201d which discusses the role athletes have in the current political and cultural climate. His show \u201cThe Shop,\u201d featuring James and friends talking about life in the backdrop of a barbershop, has been enormously popular. James has faced criticism in recent days for posting rap lyrics that included the phrase \u201cJewish money,\u201d for which he apologized, and even rival coaches have spoken out about how he\u2019s used his fame for good. \u201cTo this day, he hasn\u2019t missed a step,\u201d San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said earlier this year. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t fallen off the ledge and he\u2019s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven\u2019t had the same advantages as others.\u201d On the court, he was already an icon. Off the court, he\u2019s looking to be one as well in the years ahead. \u201cThe next star is out there,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not just talking sports. Doctor, nurse, pilots, they\u2019re out there. The one thing they need is knowing that people care about them and care about their lives. I believe it\u2019s part of my job, and I take it very seriously, to try to tap into that.\u201d * * *"},{"id":36669,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rajon-rondo-sprained-finger","date":"2018-12-27","title":"Lakers' Rondo sidelined with sprained right finger","content":" Lakers point guard Rajon Rondo will miss Thursday\u2019s game in Sacramento as he deals with a sprained sprained right ring finger, the team announced Wednesday night.

No, not Luka Doncic (although he\u2019s not doing too shabby himself). The other foreign phenom is doing his work in Brooklyn \u2013 Rodions Kurucs. Kurucs, whom the Nets grabbed with the No. 40 pick in the 2018 Draft , has burst onto the scene, becoming a key contributor as resurgent Brooklyn has won nine of its last 10. Kurucs saw his playing time spike after Allen Crabbe went down with a knee injury, and he\u2019s made the most of his opportunity. Since becoming the starter, the 6-foot-9 Latvian has averaged 12.9 points and 6.0 rebounds in 29.2 minutes over seven games. His energy and defensive effort has won over coach Kenny Atkinson. \u201cHe\u2019s just confirming, it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a flash in the pan,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThis is sustainable to me.\u201d With Crabbe close to returning, Atkinson has a decision to make, but the team\u2019s winning ways will make it hard to remove Kurucs from the starting lineup. Kurucs grabbed his first career double-double in Sunday\u2019s 111-103 win over the Suns , then tallied another one Wednesday night in Brooklyn\u2019s 132-132 win over Charlotte in double-OT, notching 13 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and three steals. \u201cI\u2019m just playing basketball. I was hungry. I didn\u2019t play for years; Now I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d said the 20-year-old Kurucs , the youngest foreign-born player to ever start for the Nets. \u201cI think also the thing I wasn\u2019t playing in Barcelona it helped me mentally to prepare myself to be together, work harder and someday come back, I just kept working on my game and that\u2019s it.\u201d * * * Last week:  1st Doncic had some memorable moments over the past week: First, he dazzled with a career-high 32 points last Thursday in a loss to the Clippers . Then, he put up 23 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and hit one of the craziest shots at the buzzer to force OT in Portland (the Mavs would eventually lose 121-118 ). To close out the week, Doncic just missed a triple-double with 21 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists to help the Mavs end a six-game losing streak. Doncic also hit the game-clinching free throws with 30 seconds left to seal the win. Ayton is nipping at his heels with some monster games, but Doncic is the Mavs\u2019 everything right now, and he\u2019s not letting up. 2. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  2n d Ayton is so close to taking over the top rung from Doncic. (If you ask his coach , Igor Kokoskov, it\u2019s no contest for Rookie of the Year, which is saying something since the Suns coach managed Doncic on the Slovenian national team.) After jumping last week back to the second rung, Ayton is putting up monster numbers to give Doncic a run at the No. 1 spot. Check out some of the Suns big man\u2019s numbers: Over his last three games, Ayton is averaging 20.0 points, 15.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocks while shooting 68.3 percent from the field. He\u2019s grabbed double-digit rebounds in six straight and nine of his last 10 games. What\u2019s most important, though, are the three shots he\u2019s blocked in each of the last two games. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing him put games together,\u201d Suns veteran Jamal Crawford said. \u201cNot just games, but quarters together. He\u2019s doing it every single night. That\u2019s a sign of going from good to great.\u201d Last week:  3rd The Knicks are mired in a five-game losing streak, but Knox has emerged as the team\u2019s best player. Knox says the game is \u201cstarting to slow down,\u201d and it shows in his numbers. In December he\u2019s averaging 17.9 points and 6.1 rebounds thanks to a stretch in which he\u2019s scored 20-plus in his last three games and five of his last eight. Knox credits his ability to hit his floater in the lane for his recent success. \u201cIt\u2019s been really consistent the last few games,\u201d Knox told Newsday . \u201cSo I\u2019ve just been able to do that without going in the paint to the bigs. The bigs in this game are really good at walling up and not fouling, so being able to go to a floater [and use my] really good touch around the basket [works].\u201d  Last week: Not ranked Jackson rejoins the Top 5 after a monumental performance against the Lakers. Jackson scored 27 points, including a game-clinching 3-pointer in the final minute \u2013 over LeBron James, no less \u2013 to help Memphis snap a five-game losing streak. L.A. had no answer for Jackson, who also grabbed nine rebounds in the 107-99 win. It was the kind of performance that shows just how good Jackson can become. Over his last four games, Jackson is averaging 16.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks while shooting 52.9 percent from the field, 44.4 pct. on 3s. \u201dWith that size, length and speed, he\u2019s a tough matchup \u2014 period,\u201d coach J.B. Bickerstaff said after the win in L.A. \u201dHe\u2019s coming into his own still, trying to figure all of this stuff out that\u2019s going on, but the skill set is unique.\u201d Last week: Not ranked Over his last three games, the Latvian has put up numbers on par with the top rookies. He\u2019s averaged 17.7 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.0 block while seeing 35.4 minutes per game. He\u2019s been incredibly efficient, as well, shooting 54.3 percent from the field and 55.6 percent on 3s. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to catch a Nets game, they\u2019re playing an energetic, fun style of basketball and Kurucs seems to always be in the mix when the Nets need a big bucket or rebound. There\u2019s no way Atkinson can keep him off the floor once Allen Crabbe returns considering the impact he\u2019s had in the last few weeks. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks The Hawks point guard had a decent week shooting, scoring 14.7 points on 41.2 percent shooting (40.0 pct on 3s). He also put up 8.3 assists per game as the Hawks went 2-1, picking up wins in New York and Detroit before falling at home to the Pacers. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton drops out of the Top 5 for the first time since Nov. 29 after struggling from the field. Teams are starting to figure out how to defend Sexton, and his numbers have dipped. After averaging 16.1 ppg on 45.0 percent shooting in November (48.1 pct on 3s), Sexton\u2019s numbers dipped to 15.4 ppg while shooting 41.2 percent, 33.3 on 3s. Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls The Bulls\u2019 big man fell off the chart last week, but jumps back in as other rookies have faltered. Carter averaged 9.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and helped the Bulls go 2-1 this week, picking up wins over the Magic and Cavs. He\u2019s only seeing about 20-25 minutes per night, but it\u2019s clear to see the talent is there. With increased time and maturation, Carter could become a big-time big man. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers Gilgeous-Alexander has literally been up-and-down over his past 12 games, going from scoring in double digits to single digits every other game. It\u2019s quite odd, really. This week, SGA had 14 points and six assists in a win over the Nuggets, then disappeared against the Warriors with three points and two assists. Wednesday, the Clippers rookie put up 13 points on 6-for-11 shooting to help LA hold off a Kings rally. Landry Shamet, Philadelphia 76ers After jumping into the Top 5 with some clutch performances, the Sixers\u2019 sharpshooter takes a tumble after a quiet week in which he scored eight points over two games, going 1-for-6 from 3-point range. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 26 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

That his excellence came at the expense of the home team mattered little to the Chicago faithful, who treated the native son and former Bulls star to MVP chants late in Minnesota\u2019s 119-94 victory . Rose, seemingly washed up entering his 11th season after years of injuries and atrophy, couldn\u2019t help but grin as the affection washed over him. While not as emotional as his improbable 50-point eruption for the Timberwolves on Oct. 31, after which he burst into tears , it might have been even more meaningful. \u201cI had to crack a smile a little bit,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt made me reminisce about some of the old days and how grateful I was to be in that position at a young age. Just trying to take it all in. The year I\u2019m having is very special.\u201d Thursday marked the second time Rose has ever played for the opposition in Chicago, the city he was born and raised in before going on to spend eight seasons with the team he grew up rooting for. That stretch ran the gamut from his peak as league MVP in 2010-11 to a series of major knee injuries that negated much of his jaw-dropping athleticism and eventually resulted in his trade to New York in 2016. Rose bottomed out last season with mediocre stints between the Knicks and Timberwolves. His career hanging in the balance, he\u2019s responded with a comeback season for the ages, averaging 18.5 points and 4.6 assists entering Wednesday\u2019s homecoming. Rose acknowledged before the game that, in years past, he might have sought vengeance against the team that sent him packing. Now, however, he\u2019s happy just to have his game back. As reported by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune : \u201cI\u2019m not looking for revenge no more. When I was injured, when I was trying to get back, I was playing revenge basketball. I think that mindset left right when I got more comfortable with knowing who I am as a person and what I wanted out of my career and life.\u201d And, of course, major adjustments to his game. Once one of the most explosive players for his size in NBA history, the 6-foot-3 Rose has dunked just once in 31 games this season. (Compare that to 43 during his MVP campaign.) But that doesn\u2019t mean he still can\u2019t find his way onto a highlight reel. Indeed, his ridiculous hanging runner from behind the backboard stacks up well with just about anything from his prime: D. Rose hangs and hits it in Chicago! pic.twitter.com\/q6nFZW8DdQ \u2014 NBA (@NBA) December 27, 2018 Rose went on to make more 10 baskets after that, with assists on eight others. And for one night, at least, he and the fans he used to thrill on such a regular basis were able to enjoy the way it used to be, regardless of what jersey he was wearing. \u201cIt was great, man,\u201d said Rose, sporting a \u201cChicago Native\u201d beanie. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.

Brooklyn. \u2014 Tom Lorenzo (@TomLorenzo) December 27, 2018 The game\u2019s been over for several hours at publication, and we\u2019re still trying to figure it out. What we do know for sure is that the Nets outlasted the Hornets 134-132 in double overtime , battling through 22 ties and 18 lead changes in the process. Kemba Walker scored 35 points, including a red-hot stretch late in regulation that forced the Nets to go Norman Dale with an old-school box-and-one. But he and Malik Monk also committed crucial gaffes that allowed the Nets to force overtime and, 10 hard-fought minutes later, finally win. Joe Harris forced the latter miscue, stripping Monk and driving for the winning layup with 3.4 seconds left in OT No. 2. A clock malfunction allowed the Hornets to get a second shot at a potential tying or winning shot, but Monk\u2019s desperation 3 was off to give the Nets their ninth win in the past 10 games without leading scorer Caris LeVert. Harris finished with a season-high 27 points, while Spencer Dinwiddie, with 37 points and 11 assists, became only the fifth player since the NBA began tracking starts to register at least 35 and 10 off the bench in those categories. Dinwiddie also drilled seven 3-pointers, and scored 20 points in the fourth quarter and overtimes. Despite those outbursts, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson was loath to single any one player out after such a thrilling win. \u201dJust a total team win,\u201d he said. \u201dSure Spencer, Spencer hit some amazing shots, but there were a lot of big plays from the whole group and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re built. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to keep going forward.\u201d Durant. Westbrook. Danny Green? Believe it or not, the veteran role player isn\u2019t just a quality wing defender. He\u2019s also one of the most dependable late-game shooters in the NBA.

The Spurs have lost seven games by double digits this season. They\u2019ve also won 12 games by double digits, and would have added a 13th if not for a late but ultimately meaningless letdown in their 111-103 victory over the Nuggets. While their overall record still looks decidedly un-Spursish at 19-16, good for eighth in the ever-brutal Western Conference, eight wins in 10 outings has them sitting just four games behind the Warriors, who vaulted into first past the Nuggets. \u201dIt just shows you that we can go out there and compete with the best and why we should look at ourselves as one of the best teams in this league as well,\u201d said DeMar DeRozan, who scored 30 points. \u201dBecause when we go up against the best, we perform and come out like we did tonight. It\u2019s definitely a confidence builder for all of us to understand we can do this.\u201d Even with five wins in seven outings, the Suns are still mired in last place in the West by six games. That\u2019s through no fault of star shooting guard Devin Booker, who continued his strong play with 35 points, eight rebounds and seven assists as the Suns edged the Magic 122-120 in overtime. It marked his sixth straight game with at least 25 points, during which he\u2019s averaging 30.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 8.0 assists.

Back then, only his feelings were hurt. This time, against the same team \u2014 well, at least in name only; more on them in a minute \u2014 the ache was in a more sensitive area. He didn\u2019t return after a left groin strain midway through the third quarter Tuesday, and pending an MRI on Wednesday, the extent of his absence is questionable. The Lakers managed without him, on the road, against the two-time defending champs, and after the Warriors, on their heels for most of the game, pulled within two points. This was equal parts surprising and impressive. Of course, that was just a sample size; while the Lakers romped 127-101 and what coach Luke Walton called \u201cour most complete game of the season,\u201d what will the near future hold if he misses any extended time? \u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory with this group,\u201d said Walton. Indeed. While LeBron\u2019s greatness has been duly noted for much of his career and especially as he approaches his 34th birthday, a more understated factor is his durability. For someone who has logged 1,415 games (regular season and playoffs) and an average of 38 minutes per night, LeBron almost always punches in the time clock. He\u2019s never been seriously injured. His minor injuries rarely restricted him more than a handful of games at a time, and on numerous occasions, his missed time was partially precautionary. Such will be the case this time; with the Lakers sitting among the top six teams in the West, and it\u2019s not yet January, Walton says there\u2019s no urgency with the injury no matter the severity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re dealing with yet,\u201d Walton said, and added, \u201cwe will be very cautious with him.\u201d Steph Curry missed 11 games recently with the exact same injury description, although it\u2019s not proper to compare. Bodies are different, degrees of severity are different, recovery is different with everyone. Still, groins (and hamstrings) are unpredictable. They decide when you return, not you. LeBron is a different creature, though. He didn\u2019t miss a single game last year during the regular season and playoffs and hasn\u2019t missed any this season. It\u2019s an unusual sight, catching LeBron in street clothes and perched on the bench. He seemed unimpressed by the latest attempt to keep him out of the lineup, which isn\u2019t surprising considering how much care and investment LeBron makes annually with his body. \u201cMe with injuries, I\u2019ve never been too concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to walk off (the court) on my own power. We\u2019ll see.\u201d The goal for the Lakers is to repackage whatever worked for them in the final quarter and a half against the Warriors and apply it until LeBron returns. They were efficient and workmanlike without him, showing poise when the score tightened and then punished Curry and Kevin Durant and the Warriors just before the fourth quarter and reconstructed the blowout. \u201cWe will continue the game plan,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cWe just want to play and get better.\u201d That sounds fine in theory. Yet this is a team that lost its last two games to the Nets and then the Grizzlies at home. Plus, LeBron is the epicenter who controls so much about the Lakers \u2014 pace, creating shots for others, dictating the flow and at times carrying the club \u2014 that it becomes tricky to change on the fly. Not that they have much choice. It\u2019ll be up to Rondo for leadership, Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram for scoring, and assorted others to become gap-fillers during the amount of time, if any, that LeBron misses. Next up are the rapidly-improving Kings in Sacramento, then an intriguing all-city tilt against the Clippers. If the Christmas Day game was a landmark of sorts for the Lakers this season, was the loss a new low for the Warriors? Ever since the Durant-Draymond Green dust-up a few weeks ago, this team has looked uninspired for stretches. Curry\u2019s injury didn\u2019t help, but even without him, the Warriors bring a hefty enough share of the team that won championships three of the last four years. Their issues were all on display in one game: a lost lead, massive defensive lapses, Klay Thompson stray shots and yet another struggle against an overmatched club, one without LeBron for almost half the game. Andre Iguodala (23 points) was the only Warrior who didn\u2019t try the spiked eggnog. On one telling play, Durant blew an uncontested layup and in frustration began jogging downcourt. Seconds later, the man he was supposed to be guarding, backup center Ivica Zubac, was gifted an uncontested dunk. Not to single out Durant; the Warriors\u2019 funk is a group thing. Green\u2019s three-point shot, now at 24 percent, has deserted him this season and opponents are showing great disrespect by giving him all the room he needs. \u201cI kind of (screwed) our offense up,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do better.\u201d Thompson\u2019s efficiency is down both inside and beyond the three-point line and this is the second poor shooting stretch for him this season and January isn\u2019t here yet. Given all that, the Warriors are 23-12, in a virtual tie with the Nuggets for first in the West, haven\u2019t played their best ball yet for any extended period of time, and we\u2019ve seen how this story ends before. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d said Durant. By comparison, the Lakers have the bigger worry. Their young core is still developing, didn\u2019t make the playoffs last season without LeBron, and have become somewhat dependent on him this season, especially in terms of leadership and for his presence in big moments. Obviously this is contingent on the MRI and LeBron\u2019s healing powers. This could very well be a short-term situation. Walton said part of this season has been spent trying to learn how to \u201cwin and compete when he\u2019s not on the floor,\u201d meaning, when LeBron was resting and catching his breath. This is something different. A player who\u2019s been the picture of good health for over a decade is trying to catch a break with this injury. Without him, will the Lakers limp like LeBron did Thursday, or show what they\u2019ve learned from him? Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He began his NBA coaching career as a member of Steve Kerr\u2019s new Golden State staff in 2014-15, focusing on player development before moving to the bench a year later. The Warriors have been the league\u2019s gold standard during his tenure, with four Finals appearances and three championships. It\u2019s a level of success that Collins never experienced in 10 seasons spent mostly as a backup center. Unlike his twin brother Jason who reached the Finals twice with the Nets, Collins got to the second round twice in five postseasons and appeared in 36 playoff games to his brother\u2019s 95. The native Californian arrived in Utah near the end of the John Stockton-Karl Malone-Jerry Sloan era, though he learned a thing or two that he leans on now, nearly two decades later. The Warriors staff \u2013 the Kerr coaching tree, if you will \u2013 has sent Alvin Gentry to New Orleans and Luke Walton to the Lakers. With Ron Adams content to sit next to Kerr and Mike Brown having held the top job in Cleveland and L.A., Collins would seem the next logical candidate for an opportunity elsewhere. In fact, he interviewed with Atlanta last spring before Lloyd Pierce was hired. Collins, 40, talked with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner a few days ago about his post-playing career, the state of the Warriors, how DeMarcus Cousins is fitting in and which set of Stanford-produced, identical twin NBA centers outranks the other. Steve Aschburner : From where you sit, how is this season going generally, and how different are the challenges from year to year? Jarron Collins : Every season, regardless of what team you\u2019re on, there\u2019s always ebbs and flows. We have a really talented core group. We\u2019ve dealt with some injuries, like every other team, so a little adversity that\u2019s an opportunity for other people to step up. That\u2019s where we find ourselves right now. We\u2019re just now getting a little healthy for the most part. Obviously not having DJ [Damian Jones, out after pectoral] hurts our rotation with the bigs. We\u2019re going to have to make another adjustment \u2013 a good thing \u2013 when DeMarcus [Cousins] comes back. SA : What would you tell a casual fan who sees all the Warriors\u2019 stars at other positions and might think your bigs aren\u2019t that essential? JC : Our big guys serve an important role, in terms of their ability to screen and create space for our shooters coming off. They have to understand the timing, the angles, when to set a screen, when to hold a screen, when to slip a screen. After that, they have to be able to make plays in the pocket \u2013 once they set a screen and start to roll to the basket, there\u2019s that pocket where they get the ball. Draymond [Green] is arguably our best big in the pocket when he gets that ball, when it\u2019s 4-on-3 on the back side of the action. A lot of that just takes experience and repetition. Our young guys are getting better.  SA : I\u2019ve heard some concern lately that too much of your team\u2019s offense is coming from Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, with not enough shots from the rest of the rotation. Can we possibly fret that Golden State might not have enough shooting? JC : If we get guys the ball in rhythm, and they catch the ball in their soft pocket, we have a lot of confidence in them going up and making shots. That being said, Steph, KD and Klay, when they come off, they create a lot of space and the word that\u2019s used is gravity. So if we continue to move the ball, we\u2019ll find guys in rhythm and make solid passes, and we have every confidence in the guys we have in our locker room to make shots. SA : Draymond\u2019s attempts are down from 10.1 three seasons ago to 8.8 last year and just 6.6 so far this season. Are you guys encouraging him to shoot even when he\u2019s struggling, just to keep the defense honest? JC : With Draymond it\u2019s just the recognition of \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat\u201d and whether he\u2019s feeling it. A lot of our guys understand what\u2019s a \u201cgood\u201d shot and what\u2019s a \u201cgreat\u201d shot. Draymond is no different. He\u2019s probably one of the smartest players I\u2019ve ever been around. So if he\u2019s in rhythm and gets a shot, I want him to shoot it with confidence. But if it\u2019s not there, and they\u2019re not going to defend him, go into a DHO [dribble handoff] or a side pick-and-roll, and his defender will be down the floor coming off against one of our shooters. It\u2019s a little bit of a feel thing and Draymond has a great feel. SA : Can you give me an update on Cousins and his recovery from the Achilles surgery? JC : We haven\u2019t put a timeline on his recovery or start date. He\u2019s making progress \u2013 tremendous progress. He\u2019s scrimmaging 5-on-5. He\u2019s done it with us, he\u2019s done it down in Santa Cruz [G League]. The most important thing for him is to get his conditioning, get his wind back, and his rhythm. The toughest part is finding him reps so he can work on that before he makes his debut. But he\u2019s looking really good. SA : Your team hasn\u2019t yet had DeMarcus the All-Star or even DeMarcus the recovering player. But you have had DeMarcus the person around all season. How has he meshed with teammates and fit into the chemistry? JC : That\u2019s an interesting question, especially for me because I\u2019ve only known DeMarcus from a competitor standpoint from when I played against him [in 2010-11]. We had some battles and I came up on the losing end of those battles quite often. So for me, it\u2019s been a very pleasant surprise to work with DeMarcus. He is a fantastic teammate. Great humor. Great basketball IQ. He\u2019s been very encouraging to our young bigs, from DJ to Loon [Kevon Looney] to JB [Jordan Bell], giving them words of encouragement and what he sees out there on the floor. Being engaged with his teammates. Really, I have nothing but positive, glowing remarks about my interactions with DeMarcus. That\u2019s the personal side. As far as the basketball side, it will work itself out. SA : When new players come to Golden State, do you notice a tendency to tread lightly, out of fear they might rock the boat? JC : I think that\u2019s on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s our job as coaches to make players comfortable in our system and then play them to their strengths. A lot of guys come in and see our system, they understand the screening, the timing, the cutting. From there, it\u2019s just about putting guys in positions to be successful. We have guys, historically, for the most part, who have come in and done a fantastic job for us doing what they do. Overall, I say it\u2019s \u201cCome in, play your game, and we\u2019ll play to your strengths.\u201d So if it\u2019s Zaza Pachulia, facilitator, screener from the elbow areas. David West, we can run our offense through him. JaVale McGee, setting screens, diving to the front of the rim, catching and finishing. We\u2019ll figure out how we can utilize each player to their best abilities. SA : You don\u2019t want a new player worried about messing up the machine? JC : You can\u2019t think that way as a player. You\u2019ve got to be aggressive. You\u2019ve got to play your game. If you come in turning down shots \u2026 when the game says \u201cshoot,\u201d you\u2019ve got to shoot. When you cut, move, do everything with pace and stay aggressive, better things are going to happen, just from a general player standpoint. SA : One of our producers is a longtime Utah Jazz fan and he wanted me to ask about your old teammate Mehmet Okur. Okur, who got in 10 NBA seasons and was an All-Star in 2007, was a pioneer of \u201cstretch fives\u201d \u2013 taking more than four 3-pointers a game at 6-foot-11, more than a decade ago. What did you make of his game, how he fit with the Jazz, and where we\u2019ve got with perimeter bigs? JC : What he provided us was spacing, the ability to knock down 3-point shots and pull the defensive center away from the basket. It allowed more space for Carlos Boozer, really, when it was working well. If you have a talented point guard [Deron Williams] and a low-post threat [Boozer], and you have that opposite big who\u2019s making shots on the perimeter, it opens things up a lot. Memo probably was a little ahead of his time. Now with everybody shooting 30 or 40 3s a game, he would have fit in perfectly. But he had a very solid career and he\u2019s doing fantastic things. SA : Did he take any grief for straying outside, when that sometimes made a big seem \u201csoft?\u201d JC : Not on our team. Quite frankly, he was one of our better shooters so we wanted him out there. We had Memo and [Gordan Giricek] and Kyle Korver and Deron. There were a lot of 1-5 pick-and-rolls with Deron and Memo, and Deron was able to get downhill and throw it back to Memo for a lot of good looks. He hit a lot of big shots for us in Utah. SA : So this second career as a coach, how did you come to it and did you like it right off? JC : I was very blessed to play for Coach [Jerry] Sloan and get a ton of experience, not only on the court but off. And learned from some really good teachers, from Coach Sloan to Mike Montgomery to Alvin Gentry. I\u2019ve always been fascinated with the game plans. And I wasn\u2019t the most athletic guy in the world, so I really had to be locked into our game plan and what it was we needed to do. Learning player tendencies and that type of stuff. I knew that once I got done playing, I wanted to stay involved in basketball. It\u2019s what I know, it\u2019s what I love, it\u2019s what I have a passion for. When this opportunity presented itself, I was so glad. And thank God I said yes. Going forward, whatever happens, happens. But I\u2019m learning a lot, I\u2019m growing as a young coach and I\u2019m blessed to get to work with the people I work with. SA : I know you don\u2019t specialize as a \u201cbig man coach,\u201d which is good as far as your growth as a coach and, someday, perhaps a head position in this league. But you do have a strong history of working with the Warriors\u2019 bigs. How much is that due to the work you did yourself, coming into this league as the No. 53 pick in 2001? JC : It\u2019s just my personality. It\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m going to be in a gym, I\u2019m gong to be working. Developing players, working with the guys, it always comes down to relationships. I\u2019ve worked with a great group of guys, from Andrew Bogut to Mo Speights, to Festus Ezeli and Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney, to DJ [Jones] and DeMarcus Cousins, to David and JaVale. I\u2019m learning from them, they\u2019re learning from me. It\u2019s been a great experience. SA : So I\u2019ve wondered about this for a long time \u2013 who is the better set of Stanford twin big men? You and your brother Jason, or Brook and Robin Lopez? JC : The Lopez twins. My brother and I had some decent careers and we were pretty good, but the Lopez twins I would definitely say take the cake. The one time Robin and I were teammates in Phoenix many years ago\u2026 [Collins let that thought trail off, because it included an infamous practice in which he beat Lopez in a scrimmage and trash-talked a bit. Lopez subsequently slammed open and broke a glass door leading to the Suns practice court.] I\u2019ve known the Lopez twins since they were kids. I grew up playing against their older brother. I\u2019ve known that family for a really long time. But if you\u2019re just asking about Lopez twins vs. Collins twins and Stanford and all that, I definitely would give the edge to Brook and Robin. SA : Last thing \u2013 this move across the bay next season, what is that going to mean to you? JC : Right now we\u2019re really appreciating our last year in Oakland. The fans who come to Oracle and cheer for us, we\u2019re so appreciative of playing in front of them. But there is a sense of excitement about the opportunity to move to San Francisco and play at the Chase Center. We appreciate what we have and we look forward to the future. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They are the gate-crashers of this exclusive party and the shot-callers, the wedge that nudges the verdict away from one player and in the direction of another. They are, quite simply, a better sidekick for Michael Jordan than Scottie Pippen ever was. They are the Golden State Warriors, who ruin it for LeBron James. Or at least, so far anyway. If not for the Warriors, talk show hosts and sports bars and folks at the water cooler who discuss these things would be forced to get their neck hairs up over another touchy subject. Anything but the GOAT. That would be settled. Without the Warriors, LeBron would own more than three championships \u2014 everyone would most likely agree to that \u2014 and less competition from the immortalized player who went 6-0 in the NBA Finals. Even now, here in his first year with a new team, and astonishingly playing at MVP level just a week away from his 34th birthday, LeBron must deal with a persistent problem. For The King, the Warriors are this recurring kryptonite-mare. Christmas Day will provide LeBron and the Lakers their first shot this season at the winners of the last two NBA titles and three of the last four, all done at the expense of James when he carried the Cavaliers. New team brings the same challenge and a clear sense of reality. LeBron knows he\u2019s up against a wall that\u2019s bigger than the one holding up Congress right now. \u201cWe can\u2019t measure ourselves against them,\u201d he said, repeating the same thoughts he held on his first day as a Laker, when he said back in October: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go to get to Golden State.\u201d That \u201clong way\u201d might require the Lakers to put someone else in the shotgun seat for the journey, and that mystery player \u2014 Anthony Davis? Kawhi Leonard? Kevin Durant? \u2014 is at least a year away, if that. The future, both near and far, involves too many issues and complications and factors, and all of those revolve around LeBron\u2019s stare-down with Father Time. A championship with a third team would weigh in LeBron\u2019s favor against Jordan mainly because it would be accomplished in his mid-30s, at a time when the bodies of even great players begin to squeak. Such high-level consistency is juicing LeBron in the GOAT talk; right now he shows no slow-down with the exception of the occasional defense lapse, and is dropping 27.6 points, 8.2 rebounds and 7.2 assists nightly. He\u2019s a considerable factor, for the first time in his career, beyond the 3-point line, and he still attacks the rim with the intensity of annoyed Draymond Green. > Best From LeBron On Christmas Day Understandably, LeBron has lost three times to two other teams before in the championship round, although one comes with a disclaimer. It was to the peak-time Spurs in 2007 when LeBron was the definition of a one-man show. The next loss to the Spurs was somewhat understandable because San Antonio was solid that season against the Heat; the hiccup against Dirk-led Dallas was less forgiving. It is the Warriors who\u2019ve squirted mustard on the legacy, not because LeBron\u2019s teams were better, but because they\u2019ve beaten him three times. That puts LeBron\u2019s Finals record at 3-6, though not totally his fault, but still cannot compete with MJ\u2019s 6-0. There\u2019s the argument that Jordan never won a championship against anyone on the Warriors\u2019 level; although it\u2019s always tricky to compare eras and teams because of different rules (hand-checking, for one) and trends (three-point shooting, for another), LeBron faced Steph Curry and Kevin Durant the last two summers. Jordan had John Stockton-Karl Malone twice, Gary Payton-Shawn Kemp and Charles Barkley-Kevin Johnson once each. For what it\u2019s worth. That\u2019s all in the past, which is beyond LeBron\u2019s control. Now the discussion will be fixated on the next few years and what he can or cannot do to win a fourth title, which may once again be determined by the Warriors to some degree. \u201cHe\u2019s still LeBron James,\u201d said Green. \u201cHe\u2019ll boost any team he\u2019s on and he\u2019ll make them a contender. It\u2019s a different look for him, more than what he\u2019s used to, because of the makeup of the team, but they have him and so they\u2019ll be a tough test. Any team with LeBron is a tough test for anyone.\u201d LeBron is bringing Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and also a batch of veterans to the Warriors challenge. It\u2019s a bit daunting, especially since the Lakers have suffered some bad losses lately, to the Wizards, Nets and Grizzlies. Yes, Ingram and Rajon Rondo just returned from injuries. That\u2019s all in the Lakers\u2019 favor. Also consider that the Lakers you see after the All-Star break could be a more accurate version should the young players keep developing and trending up. \u201c We \u2018re a team that\u2019s trying to get better every week, better every month,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cWe want to have championship habits.\u201d But will that make them better than, say, the Oklahoma City Thunder in a playoff series? The Nuggets? Trail Blazers? No one has stepped forth as a solid No. 2 team in the West, assuming the Warriors, despite their record at the moment, remain the clear No. 1. That\u2019s why LeBron\u2019s best chance to repel the Warriors will happen with his next team, not this one. The Warriors haven\u2019t exactly stormed through the season\u2019s first 30 or so games; Curry was hurt, Durant and Green had a spat and even wins against the likes of Dallas, Utah, Sacramento and Orlando were a grind. But for a team like the Warriors, the regular season just gets in the way. Also, at some point they\u2019ll welcome All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to the mix. Coach Steve Kerr said: \u201cI really like where we are. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played great basketball for a while. I think we started out really well, 10-1, and the last five or six weeks we\u2019ve been through an awful lot with injuries and with just trying to find a rhythm, a chemistry and a groove with the new groups that we put on the floor. So to not be there yet, but to still have the record that we do, I think we are in a good position. I think we are going to get a lot better.\u201d It\u2019s a good time to get a first look at the player who only figured them out once in The Finals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him a lot over the last four years,\u201d Curry said. Another championship for LeBron would match Jordan\u2019s win total and would liven up the debate. Surely the Warriors will factor in one way or another: their demise at some point, or continued choke-hold. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

"},{"id":36750,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-christmas-day-viewers-guide-2018","date":"2018-12-24","title":"Reasons to watch NBA on Christmas Day","content":"Why you should be watching: Two words; Giannis Antetokounmpo. The most dominant force in the league this season resides in Milwaukee. That\u2019s right, the Greek Freak sits atop the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder heading into the Christmas Day showcase games. And with good reason. The Bucks are riding the wave their dynamic superstar forward has created in his first season in Mike Budenholzer\u2019s system. Open it up and enjoy because \u2026:  The Bucks are more than a one-man show. Antetokounmpo should be joined on the All-Star team this season by Khris Middleton, who is playing at that level, and point guard Eric Bledsoe is shooting better than he ever has in Budenolzer\u2019s aggressive, shooter-friendly system. Watching the Bucks try and set a record for 3-pointers taken and made should be entertaining enough. But the Knicks will offer some entertainment value of their own as they attempt to match the Bucks shot-for-shot with Tim Hardaway Jr. leading the way. The gift we\u2019re hoping for is \u2026: The Knicks could use a statement win before a global audience to jump start the post-Christmas portion of their season-long grind. The Bucks have spent most of this season frightening the competition, both in the Eastern Conference and beyond. They\u2019ve got the gift that\u2019ll keep on giving for years in Antetokounmpo, who\u2019ll get another chance to show the basketball public that what they\u2019ve hard about a contender rising in the Central Division is real. Why you should be watching: Do we really need anyone to remind us to tune in for every Russell Westbrook-James Harden matchup for the foreseeable future? Didn\u2019t think so. The matchup of the last two Kia MVPs winners is enough of an incentive to lock in on this one. And the fact that the Thunder occupy the space in the standings most thought was reserved for the Rockets only adds to the intrigue. Open it up and enjoy because \u2026:  The real showstopper in this one isn\u2019t either one of the MVP winners. Thunder swingman Paul George is the player you need to lock in on as he continues his dark horse MVP campaign for a much-improved team (the Thunder are light years away from the group that started the season 0-4). There are few soap operas better right now than the Rockets, who are dealing with yet another injury to All-Star point guard Chris Paul (hamstring) and a failure to play up to expectations that threatens to swallow up their season before Santa\u2019s finished off his cookies and milk. The gift we\u2019re hoping for is \u2026: What Westbrook and Harden wear into the building is worth a few moments of your time as these two fashion-forward superstars never fail to make an impression. But it\u2019s the competitive fervor on the court that should provide the ultimate viewing pleasure. The Thunder would love to take over the position the Rockets held last season, as the legitimate threat to the Golden State Warriors\u2019 stranglehold on the Western Conference throne. In the absence of a Christmas tilt against the two-time defending champs, the Rockets make an ideal fill in. Why you should be watching:  The Eastern Conference version of Thunder-Rockets, the schedule makers look pretty good slotting the Sixers and Celtics in this spot. No one relishes an opportunity to take down a projected heavyweight the way the Sixers do (what else would you expect with Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid leading the charge?). The suddenly chummy Celtics, however, appear to be the team most eager to prove that they are indeed who we all thought they were in the summer, when they were the consensus pick to ascend to the top of the heap in place of Cleveland. Open it up and enjoy because \u2026:  Kyrie Irving has embraced his role as the leader of this disjointed Celtics bunch in ways that fans in Cleveland have to be enjoying with an eyebrow raised. Kyrie trying to convince his young teammates to follow his lead is rich, given his reluctance to do exactly that when he was in their shoes. As far as rivalries go, this is perhaps the day\u2019s deepest and most volatile. The Sixers are still smarting from that playoff ouster at the hands of the Celtics. And they won\u2019t have ant sympathy for the Celtics as they continue their search for good health and better chemistry.  The gift we\u2019re hoping for is \u2026: A Ben Simmons-Kyrie point guard duel will make this game shine even brighter than usual. And they\u2019re both more than capable of going off on the big stage. But the real treat here is going to be watching Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum match wits in what could be a preview of fireworks to come in a potential playoff matchup. Tatum\u2019s sophomore season has been a bit choppier than expected. And Butler, whose shown a penchant for schooling youngsters (teammates and opponents) is surely betting on himself in this game within the game. Why you should be watching:  With all of the recent history dripping off of this LeBron James-Warriors rivalry, the inclusion of the Los Angeles Lakers into the mix only serves to take this spectacle to the next level. LeBron insists this isn\u2019t a measuring stick game for the upstart Lakers, not against a Warriors juggernaut that has won three of the last four Larry O\u2019Brien trophies. Yeah, whatever you say big fella. Folks who haven\u2019t watched a minute of NBA basketball season will be tuned into this one. Count on it. Open it up and enjoy because \u2026:  Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have moved into that cosmic zone that only the all-time greats are capable of locating (see their work in Sunday\u2019s win over the Los Angeles Clippers for proof). We already know how the superstars respond in a matchup of this nature. The great unknown is how the likes of Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball will react to the marquee spotlight at Oracle Arena. The Lakers\u2019 youngsters have thrived at times and struggled at others in their first season inside the LeBron bubble. But they haven\u2019t seen anything like what they\u2019ll experience in Oakland on this night. The gift we\u2019re hoping for is \u2026: Draymond Green hasn\u2019t had a true breakout game since returning from his extended injury absence. With Lance Stephenson in uniform on the other side, the opportunity for fireworks would appear to be extremely high. We\u2019d settle for some Finals-level intensity from both of the world class agitators in the building. That and vintage performances from LeBron, Steph, KD and Klay Thompson are expected. Anything else beyond that is really gravy on the best basketball meal of the day. Why you should be watching:  We\u2019re dubbing the nightcap of the Christmas Day showcase the \u201cRespect Bowl.\u201d The Trail Blazers are always on the hunt for more respect and the Jazz, one of the trendy summer picks as a team poised to become a contender in the Western Conference this season, could stand to show a little self-respect in the way they tackle the remainder of this season.  Open it up and enjoy because \u2026:  Second-year Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell is suffering from the same sophomore spell that has plagued Jayson Tatum in Boston. It\u2019s one thing to surprise the basketball world as a rookie and another to come back better and even more dangerous the second time around. We\u2019re betting on Spider showing up and showing out for the Christmas Day crowd. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Damian Lillard will not allow someone else to steal the spotlight from him. He warmed up for Mitchell and the Jazz by finishing off Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks Sunday night . You know his swagger travels, so expect to see his competitive best against Mitchell and the Jazz. The gift we\u2019re hoping for is \u2026: Joe Ingles stealing the show would make for an ideal end to a day full of some the league\u2019s biggest and brightest superstars. And the sweet-shooting Jazz swingman is one of the league\u2019s criminally underrated stars. It would also be nice to see the rest of that Jazz team we expected to make things interesting this season make an appearance. Christmas Day games have always served as a launching pad\/turning point for teams willing to dive in. And the Blazers and Jazz both seem like prime candidates to take advantage of the opportunity. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The start of 2018-19 hasn\u2019t been as kind to either squad, but James Harden gave Jazz fans flashbacks with his 47-point performance on Monday night. That effort \u2014 as well as the step-back step-back he pulled off that lit the internet on fire \u2014 helped Houston pull off a narrow victory. Cavs 92, Pacers 91 \u2014 Given the kind of season the Cavs are having, it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll end up in this space often in our weekly recap. But props to Cleveland for fighting back all game and coming up with a timely, game-winning tip-in from Larry Nance Jr. that ended the Pacers\u2019 seven-game win streak. Raptors 99, Pacers 96 \u2014 Rough stretch of days for Indiana in Week 10. First, their seven-game win streak got snapped by the lottery-bound Cavaliers. A day later, they built a hearty 17-point lead on the road against the Raptors \u2026 and watched it disappear and turn into a loss. Credit to Toronto, though, which seems to constantly keep proving it is the class of the East with wins like this. Rockets 136, Wizards 118 \u2014 What\u2019s more surpising: that Houston set the single-game record for 3-pointers (26) or that the record was set by noted non-marksman Michael Carter-Williams? We\u2019ll let you chew on that one during the holidays. Bucks 120, Celtics 107 \u2014 Milwaukee proved both its resiliency and greatness in one game. After falling into a 10-1 hole in the first quarter, the Bucks used a 16-0 run to run to a romp in Boston on Friday. Aside from the weight of this win for Milwaukee, the weight of the loss (and other recent defeats) for Boston sparked a team meeting afterward. Clippers 132, Nuggets 111 \u2014 A team finally brought Denver back down to earth, and fittingly, it was the other team that has surprised so much in the West this season. This was the Nuggets\u2019 first loss of 2018-19 by 10 or more points and ended their four-game win streak, too. Thunder 107, Jazz 106 \u2014 Is it last April again? Any time spent watching Thunder-Jazz on Saturday brought back memories of last season\u2019s first-round playoff series. Paul George was MVP-like all game, netting 43 points and helping OKC outscore the Jazz 23-2 when the offense went through him. Warriors 129, Clippers 127 \u2014 Years from now, this is the kind of game by Golden State and former Kia MVP winner Stephen Curry that will prove hallmarks of their success. Not only did Curry go for 42 points in his typical style, but he also had enough energy, moxie and courage to sink the game-winning bucket with :00.5 left in the game. James Harden (47 points, 14-31 FG, 4-12 3pt FG, 6 reb, 5 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 Yes, he had a rough night from deep in this 40-point effort. But two of his 3-pointers came in the final minute, including a win-sealing one over Ricky Rubio with 13.3 seconds left. Spencer Dinwiddie (27 points, 8-15 FG, 4-8 3pt FG, 6 reb, 3 ast in 31 minutes) \u2014 We tip our caps in this space to Dinwiddie, but no so much for his stats line on Wednesday. No, he gets the nod for powering the Nets to their seventh straight win \u2014 something the franchise hadn\u2019t accomplished since 2013. Giannis Antetokounmpo (30 points, 8-13 FG, 1-3 3pt FG, 8 reb, 5 ast in 33 minutes) \u2014 In key showdowns with intra-conference powers, the star players have to shine. That\u2019s exactly what \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d did in powering Milwaukee to a huge win before its time in the Christmas Day spotlight. (Granted, the Bucks did lose on Saturday to Miami \u2026) Thomas Bryant (31 points, 14-14 FG, 3-3 FT, 13 reb in 35 minutes) \u2014 Bryant set a career-high and, at one point, scored 16 of 18 points for Washington across a stretch of the first and second overtime. It was a night to behold and a great moment for a player who is essentially a role player for Washington. Paul George (43 points, 15-25 FG, 5-10 3pt FG, 14 reb, 6 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 OKC\u2019s star forward made it clear after the game on Saturday that his team\u2019s loss to Utah in the playoffs was still on his mind. He blistered the Jazz time and again to power the Thunder to a close win against its newest rival. Stephen Curry (42 points, 12-22 FG, 6-15 3pt FG, 6 reb, 2 ast in 35 minutes) \u2014 The Clippers set an NBA and team record for 3-point shooting in a half by nailing 13 for 16 in the first half. That effort, though, was for naught as Curry lit up the Clippers time and again and in an odd twist of fate, drove the lane for the game-winning basket with :00.5 left. \u201cI had no clue that we had that many until the fans started chanted: \u2018three,\u2019 every time we got the ball. So it\u2019s cool to do it together as a team.\u201d \u2014 Rockets guard Chris Paul , on the team\u2019s NBA-record 26 made 3-pointers on Wednesday night \u201cWhen we drafted Marvin at 2, we were high-fiving like crazy. We got the right guy for us. Where we\u2019re going to be, this isn\u2019t going to be a story in three days. It\u2019s going to be definitely buried in five years from now when we\u2019ve got the next Durant, Westbrook. That\u2019s how good they\u2019re going to be.\u201d \u2014 Kings coach Dave Joerger , on his combination of Marvin Bagley III and De\u2019Aaron Fox \u201cI told [Rodney] Hood to put the ball up on the rim with a couple seconds left so I can see if I could do something with it. He made a good move and did exactly that. I was lucky enough to get a hand on it.\u201d \u2014 Cavs forward Larry Nance Jr. , on his game-winner vs. Indiana \u201cHe\u2019s in his 20s, I\u2019m in my 30s. Takes me a little longer to get warmed up.\u201d \u2014 Lakers forward LeBron James , on his dunk being blocked by the Nets\u2019 Jarrett Allen \u201cThey bought in a long time ago, man. There\u2019s a lot of fun in that locker room right now. Winning is great. Hopefully we can sustain this.\u201d \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone \u201cWe watched film, talked about some things, and I guess they listened. Or maybe the other teams just all missed shots every night. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a big change, for sure.\u201d \u2014 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich , on his team\u2019s defense vs. the Magic \u2018\u201dI owed this to this team. I didn\u2019t like the way I finished in this arena last time I was here. That was on my mind.\u201d \u2014 Thunder swingman Paul George , after his 43-point effort Saturday in Utah \u201cI had no idea. I was just in the flow of the game. I just let the game come to me, and as soon as I felt like I was in the rhythm of it, I just went out and took it.\u201d \u2014 Wizards center Thomas Bryant , on his 14-for-14 shooting night vs. Phoenix We\u2019re all busy.

During the five Christmas Day games, each participating team and their players host special on-court gift presentations for local youth following the national anthem: These games, some of the biggest of the season, are the perfect venue to cap Season of Giving, said Tara Schwartz, NBA Vice President of Social Responsibility, whose team coordinates the month-long event. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of year where everybody \u2013 players, coaches, owners, referees, legends and teams \u2013 are giving back and working to provide happiness to the people who need it most,\u201d said Schwartz. \u201cThey took part in 250 events since the Monday before Thanksgiving, benefiting hundreds of youth and families across the country. We love telling that story and want to make sure that the people sitting at home watching understand the incredible impact these players are having off the court as well.\u201d Back in Oklahoma City, Jerry Boyd certainly understood. He has custody of his four young grandchildren and brought them to Target for the shopping spree. The children looked overwhelmed when they walked into the store. They were paired with Thunder guard Raymond Felton, who escorted them around the store to pick out gifts. \u201cYou see these grandpas trying to provide for their grandkids and trying to raise them at the same time. It\u2019s tough,\u201d Felton said in the video. Later, out of earshot of the kids, he said to one of the Target employees, \u201cLet me get a PS4.\u201d He surprised the oldest grandchild with the gift. \u201cThank you, Raymond,\u201d said the boy, gushing. \u201cHe just bought me a PS4!\u201d \u201cI hope this is something [the kids] remember for the rest of their lives,\u201d Felton said. \u201c[I hope] it\u2019s a moment in their life they always cherish.\u201d"},{"id":36776,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2018-19-week-11","date":"2018-12-24","title":"Power Rankings, Week 11: Parity keeps Nuggets at No. 1","content":" December has been a month of parity, with every team having at least three losses , only one (the Knicks) having fewer than three wins, and a bunch of modest winning streaks coming to an end in the last week.

It doesn\u2019t matter if, as a team, Golden State underwhelms from beyond the arc. It doesn\u2019t matter if their opponent does the opposite. They can even withstand a return of cold-shooting Klay, Draymond Green\u2019s continued struggles from the field, and a Kevin Durant sprained ankle. All of those things happened in Golden State\u2019s 129-127 win over the Clippers on Sunday, and it just didn\u2019t matter because of the two guys that account for three of the last five Kia MVP awards. Stephen Curry ( 42 points ) and Durant ( 35 points ) could not be contained, much less stopped. They outscored the entire Clippers starting lineup by themselves, attempted just one less free throw than their opponents and combined for a single turnover. The duo\u2019s moments were as big as their numbers, all of them vintage. The absurd Curry 3-pointer plus the foul to put Golden State ahead: The seeming Durant dagger to put the Warriors up eight with two-plus minutes remaining: But the Clippers, as they\u2019ve done since disbanding Lob City, refused to go away. Avery Bradley\u2019s all-hustle putback slam tied the game with 19.6 seconds remaining. So the Warriors called on Curry one last time, and the answer was textbook: Pick-and-roll. Attack the switch. Ball game. The Warriors aren\u2019t themselves yet, but they have won 8 of their last 10. Cousins is dunking on teammates in practice. A Jan. 15 meeting at West-best Denver looms. Yet even without relative perfection, Golden State\u2019s pair of aces can \u2014 and did \u2014 trump their opponents\u2019 best shot. Facing the best slate of shooters in NBA history, LA gave them a gallon-sized dose of their own medicine. The Clippers shot a jaw-dropping 18-for-23 from beyond the arc \u2014 the most efficient performance to date by any team that attempted at least 20 3-pointers in a game. Here\u2019s their absurd shot chart:  Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari led the 3-point assault, shooting a combined 11-for-12 from distance. The Mavs\u2019 ultimately lost to the Blazers 121-118 in overtime, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the degree of difficulty or overall awesomeness of the shot Luka Doncic hit at the end of regulation: As we close out the holiday season, Victor Oladipo snuck a surprise in on gamenight. The Pacers All-Star gifted the car he won last season \u2014 as part of being named Kia Most Improved Player \u2014 to Renita Hills, a survivor of domestic violence who now works with The Julian Center of Indianapolis. Special shoutout to Hills and Oladipo for being and rewarding, respectively, the people who make our communities a safer place. The Hawks gutted out a 98-95 win at Detroit, and the leading force behind it was 41-year-old Vince Carter. The eight-time All-Star led Atlanta with 18 points, tying the NBA record for oldest player to score at least 18 in a game. Keep revving that engine, Vince. The Kings got in on the feel-good holiday moments, surprising a mother-daughter pairing with a high-stakes game of White Elephant. In this game, however, the signed jersey was only the second-best gift available. Congratulations, thank you and welcome home to Navy Seaman Austin Kropp. It was just a year ago that DeMarcus Cousins \u2014 then with New Orleans \u2014 was burning his former Kings team for triple-doubles . Sacramento, meanwhile, appeared doomed to continue its listless path of playoff-less basketball. Fast forward to Sunday, and you\u2019ll see the bottom line of that trade leaning in Sacramento\u2019s favor. Buddy Hield \u2014 the Kings\u2019 main return for dealing Cousins to the Pelicans \u2014 is an established NBA scorer (20.4 PPG, .440 3FG%). Sacramento (18-15) is off to its best start since 2004-05. The Pelicans, meanwhile, saw Cousins join the Warriors during the summer and are now fending off those who would like to join forces with Anthony Davis elsewhere. Hield scorched New Orleans \u2014 the team that drafted him No. 6 overall in 2016 \u2014 for 28 points in the Kings\u2019 122-117 victory. Sacramento is now seventh in the West, while New Orleans sits 14th. It didn\u2019t count due to an offensive foul, but this Jeff Green poster is still worth an admiring glance."},{"id":36753,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pacers-victor-oladipo-car-giveaway","date":"2018-12-24","title":"Big assist: Oladipo gifts car to domestic violence survivor","content":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Victor Oladipo got an early jump on the giving season.

The 295 combined points were the most since the Denver Nuggets and Seattle SuperSonics totaled 298 in two overtimes on April 6, 2008. The most notable performance belonged to Wizards center Thomas Bryant, who became the first player since Gary Payton in 1995 to make at least 14 field goals without a miss. Bryant scored a career-high 31 points, grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds and made all three of his free throws. At one point, Bryant scored 16 of 18 points for Washington across a stretch of the first and second overtime. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI had no idea throughout the game and I had no idea after the game until people started telling me about it.\u201d The only player to sink more field goals without a miss is Wilt Chamberlain, who had four such games \u2014 15 for 15 against the Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 20, 1967, an NBA-record 18 for 18 against Baltimore on Feb. 24, 1967 and 16 for 16 against Baltimore again on March 19, 1967 \u2014 for Philadelphia. He was 14 for 14 for the Lakers against Detroit on March 11, 1969. Bryant\u2019s shot chart shows his shot selection was spot on.  Make that back-to-back 43-point games for Paul George. Three nights after scoring 43 in a win against the Kings, George did it again in a tense 107-106 victory in Utah. He went 15 for 25 from the field, including five 3-pointers, and added 14 rebounds, six assists and five steals. George, who is averaging 31.4 points in December, scored 18 points in the last 6:04 of the third quarter during which Oklahoma City swung the momentum with a 23-2 run. With four straight wins, the Thunder tied the Nuggets for the best record in the Western Conference. Rookie sensation Luka Doncic nearly doubled his season dunks total in the Mavs\u2019 126-120 loss in Oakland. He previously threw down four times this season but had three dunks against the Warriors, including this explosive jam that left Jonas Jerebko in the dust. Later in the game Doncic awkwardly fell out of bounds when Draymond Green impeded his path to the rim. Doncic stumbled into a courtside seat occupied by a 10-year-old boy. Doncic quickly checked on the young fan and later gave him his autographed jersey from the game. Jokic loses his cool  Frustrated with officials, Nikola Jokic was ejected with 6:38 left in the third quarter after screaming at an official following a foul call. Juancho Hernangomez tried to cover Jokic\u2019s mouth and Nuggets coach Mike Malone did his best to calm him down, but Jokic\u2019s night was over with the Nuggets down by 11 points. Things went downhill fast once the usually mild-mannered Jokic left the game, and the Clippers rolled to a 132-11 victory \u2014 Denver\u2019s worst loss of the season. Nuggets coach Mike Malone said he wasn\u2019t sure what Jokic had yelled to draw the ejection. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him,\u201d Malone said.

Toronto. Philadelphia. Indiana. Boston became the latest Eastern Conference contender to fall to the Bucks, 120-107 . The formula remains the same for the modern-day deer from Wisconsin: a whole lot of Giannis (30 points on 13 field goal attempts), and a gaggle of marksmen surrounding him. Eight different Bucks hit at least one 3-pointer en route to a 16-for-40 performance (40 percent) from beyond the arc. Milwaukee\u2019s second-ranked defense remained just as impressive, holding Boston (albeit without Al Horford, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris) to 38.5 percent shooting and 29.4 percent from deep. The Bucks (22-9) are the hottest team in the East, having won four in a row and creeped within 1.5 games of league-leading Toronto (25-9). And yeah, Antetokounmpo is surfing his team\u2019s wave of new-found confidence big-time. Fear the deer, because they\u2019re not afraid of anyone else. The Bucks\u2019 latest victim didn\u2019t feel the usual post-loss routine was enough. Indeed, the Celtics have now lost three straight and slipped to fifth in the East . This follows an impressive eight-game win streak that seemed to have righted the ship, only to see them struggle once more. Boston players met after the game to discuss what ails them. It\u2019s worth asking for a team that lacked neither confidence nor production throughout its injury-riddled run to the Eastern Conference finals a year ago. The finer points of that discussion \u2014 and the results thereof \u2014 remain a mystery for now. Whatever sickness that rampaged through the Lakers locker room \u2014 and nearly kept three players out of action against New Orleans \u2014 didn\u2019t seem to affect LeBron too badly. That\u2019s despite the fact that James skipped shootaround and was a game-time decision. Instead, No. 23 suited up anyway and wound up with a triple-double (22 points, 12 rebounds, 14 assists) well before the final buzzer of L.A.\u2019s 112-104 win over the Pelicans. I mean, if this is what he looks like on a sick day\u2026 There was a lot of anonymous discontent after James publicly stated earlier this week that he would like to play with Anthony Davis , who is one-and-a-half seasons away from free agency and shares the same agent as James himself. When asked about the reaction to his comments, James dryly requested that the reporter ask if he would like to play with [insert All-Star name here]. At the end of making his point, James ended with this assertive conclusion. \u201cThey wish that they can control what you say,\u201d James declared. \u201cThey can\u2019t control me \u2014 at all.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the Kyle Korver we know. Or at least, not the one we see very often. See, the Korver that played in Utah\u2019s 120-90 demolishing of Portland hit seven shots \u2014 and four of them were 2-pointers. That\u2019s just the 10th time since Jan. 1, 2014, that Korver has hit seven shots and the majority weren\u2019t from beyond the arc. Even Damian Lillard is subject to Shaqtin\u2019 sequences\u2026 After missing the dunk, Lillard winds up with an offensive rebound, drives baseline and whips the ball to\u2026 his teammate on the bench. The Brooklyn Nets, who saw their longest winning streak since mid-January of 2013 snapped by the Pacers . Their starting lineup back then: Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Keith Bogans and Reggie Evans. Nope, not Brook. Robin Lopez hit his third 3-pointer of the season and is now a room-temperature 30 percent (3 for 10) through 26 games.

Team President Steve Mills said Friday the team is pleased with Porzingis\u2019 recovery from a torn anterior cruciate ligament ACL, and another round of testing scheduled for mid-February could clarify his timeline for his return. The Knicks hope their All-Star forward will be ready to play this season, but won\u2019t push it. \u201cWe\u2019d like him to get on the court, we\u2019d love to see him play,\u201d Mills said. \u201cBut we also acknowledge that he is a really, really important part of the long-term future of this franchise and one thing we\u2019re not going to do is take any real risk with a 22-year-old player in his position.\u201d Porzingis was hurt Feb. 6 after landing on a dunk in a game against Milwaukee. He has gone through a series of tests during his rehab, but Mills said they want to see more improvement before Porzingis can move onto the next level of activity. For now, he is working individually with a coach, able to do some pull-up shooting and dunking. But Mills won\u2019t speculate about when Porzingis can do more, or even if he will get on the court in February if he meets the necessary benchmarks at the next evaluation. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluid process so I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s what will happen, but I also don\u2019t want to say that it\u2019s impossible to happen,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure. We\u2019re going to see as he sort of ramps up his progression how he feels.\u201d The Knicks are near the bottom of the league with a 9-24 record entering their game Friday against Atlanta, so Porzingis won\u2019t be able to save them this season. But having him on the court could help them in the summer, as potential free agents may want to see if the 7-foot-3 Latvian is fully back before they would consider the Knicks. But Mills said that won\u2019t play into the Knicks\u2019 thinking. \u201cThe most important thing for us is to have Kristaps on the court when he feels comfortable being on the court and we feel comfortable that he should be out there,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThat\u2019s more important than any timetable this season, some point in the summer. The most important thing is that we know that we\u2019ve got this guy in a place that he feels comfortable on the floor and we feel comfortable in his ability to be part of what we\u2019re doing long term. That\u2019s more important than anything else that we can lay out.\u201d Mills also declined to discuss how Porzingis\u2019 recovery would factor into whether the team offers him a contract extension in the summer. He believes Porzingis \u2013 who grew so fed up with the franchise in its final days under Phil Jackson that he skipped his exit meeting before returning to Europe for the summer \u2013 is pleased with the team now. Mills said Porzingis is almost always at the practice facility and sits with teammates during film sessions. But Mills said there haven\u2019t been any discussions about if Porzingis wants to join them on the court this season. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t talked about it because we\u2019ve always left it in the context of he\u2019s going to play whenever we feel like he\u2019s ready to play and whenever he feels like he\u2019s ready to play,\u201d Mills said."},{"id":36728,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ersan-ilyasova-has-successful-surgery","date":"2018-12-21","title":"Bucks' Ersan Ilyasova has successful surgery on nose","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova underwent successful surgery today to repair a fractured nose, which he sustained during practice on Dec. 16.

This was a clash of \u201cunicorns,\u201d Anthony Davis vs. Giannis Antetokounmpo, two improbably talented and remarkably versatile young big men around whom any franchise would eagerly build. The blessed two in this case were Davis\u2019 visiting New Orleans Pelicans facing Antetokounmpo\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks won, 123-115 , but the thrill within the game was the matchup of a potential new-age Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, stretched out and reprogrammed, competition meeting evolution meeting sleeve length. In a perfect pebble-grained world, the Bucks and the Pelicans could have been giving us a preview of multiple Finals to come. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Both of \u2018em,\u201d New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. \u201cBoth of \u2018em play at a real high level and both of \u2018em impact the game in ways other than just scoring. Probably these two guys as much as anybody in the league.\u201d Said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer: \u201cWe\u2019re here with Giannis every day, every night. What he does, whatever you want to call it, he plays pretty much every position for us and does everything. \u2026 And Anthony Davis is so unique in how he scores and so special and so gifted.\u201d Unfortunately, the prospect of seeing that even once in The Finals is slim, never mind the three times Bird and Magic had or the four in a row we\u2019ve had with LeBron James against Golden State . Four out of seven games in June? No, we\u2019ve got to settle for two each regular season \u2014 Davis and Antetokounmpo meet on March 12 in New Orleans \u2014 and possibly a few serendipitous All-Star moments. For either or both to become Finals regulars, conventional wisdom says, they\u2019ll have to relocate. Not just to new ZIP codes but to different time zones.  Both Davis and Antetokounmpo are in the ESPN spotlight tonight, with the Bucks visiting the Celtics ( 8 ET ) with Pelicans-Lakers to follow ( 10:30 ET ). So it\u2019s Antetokounmpo and Davis, yes, but separated and propped up against the league\u2019s biggest name brands. That\u2019s why Antetokounmpo theatrically playing the recruiting game for Davis after Wednesday\u2019s game \u2014 \u201cCome to the Bucks, man,\u201d he joked. \u201cCome to the Bucks\u201d \u2014 got treated like a \u201cships passing\u201d moment. Davis to Milwaukee? Bah! That\u2019s as likely as LeBron teaming up with Davis in \u2026 wait for it \u2026 New Orleans! Bwahaha! The prevailing view is that Davis in fact will leave New Orleans as a free agent in the summer of 2020 or be traded ahead of that. Despite Gentry\u2019s declarations to the contrary , the Celtics may be the suitor most capable of prying him loose with attractive young players and Draft picks. James, meanwhile, signaled the Lakers\u2019 interest in Davis with or without the blessing of bosses Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka. The Pelicans big man already owns an estate in L.A. and could cope passing up an extra $39 million if he can pocket a five-year, $205 million deal from new employers. Davis has played in just 13 playoff games in his six seasons, and he is unlikely to internalize much longer the responsibility for boosting the Pelicans to something special. Antetokounmpo? Maybe he\u2019ll stay in Milwaukee \u2014 that\u2019s the crux of a Bleacher Report story this week , searching for reasons he might stray from the pattern of so many stars who left smaller markets (Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Chris Paul among them). But no one doubts there will be constant pressure and endless speculation when he gets contractually to the point Davis is at now \u2014 within 18 months of free agency. The drumbeat could prove deafening. A lone superstar leading his team to The Finals and a title has been done in the NBA, just not often or lately. Rick Barry did it with the Warriors in 1975, and Hakeem Olajuwon had no reasonable sidekick when he led Houston in 1994 (Clyde Drexler arrived for the \u201995 title run). The Lakers and the Celtics of the 1980s, however, had multiple Hall of Famers. Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen, Shaquille O\u2019Neal had Kobe Bryant, and Tim Duncan had either David Robinson or Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Boston went with three in 2008, leading to Miami\u2019s Super Friends and James\u2019 variation on that when he returned to Cleveland. Golden State is a veritable Justice League of future Hall of Famers. That makes the idea of Antetokounmpo and Davis getting it done with only role players and running buddies \u2014 or that they\u2019d even want to try \u2014 seems quaint. Or does it? \u201cSure they can,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cMarkets, social media, whatever, the small market thing is completely different from what it was when I came into the league [1988 as a San Antonio assistant]. There\u2019s really no \u2018small market.\u2019 Giannis has got as many \u2018followers\u2019 as anybody out there.\u201d Jon Horst, the Bucks\u2019 GM, calls formulating a winning ensemble around Antetokounmpo \u201cour mission statement.\u201d He wants to prove himself right, too, when Horst says \u201cThere are athletes where market matters, the excitement of an L.A. or a New York or the size of a Chicago. But I think more often than not, professional athletes want to win.\u201d Snazzy arenas and practice facilities \u2014 the Bucks have both, the Pelicans the latter \u2014 might persuade All-Star helpers to stay, but can that lure them? With the likes of Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Eric Bledsoe, Julius Randle and the rest, can either organization get where it wants (and where its star expects) to go? Timing always is tricky \u2014 the Heat got Shaq in time for Dwyane Wade\u2019s breakout in 2006, but there often is a lag between a franchise player\u2019s emergence and the scramble to get and keep sufficient help. The Cavs whiffed on James\u2019 first stint, Minnesota couldn\u2019t do it with Kevin Garnett nor Toronto with Vince Carter and on and on. Antetokounmpo and Davis have their work cut out for them, with proper challenges between them and any Finals dreams or moving vans. The Bucks (21-9) rank second in the East but need to nail down a top-four seed and perhaps get two or three rounds of postseason play to consider 2018-19 a success. Davis\u2019 Pelicans (15-17) are tied for 12th in the West and yet only 3 1\/2 games out of a fourth place tie. His reputation is at stake in this, too. A player\u2019s alleged \u201cgreatness\u201d does require him to do some heavy lifting, not just pine for help. His New Orleans teammates weren\u2019t rattled by James\u2019 covetous comments Tuesday about Davis. They already know playing with him is \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d and they\u2019d squint at anyone around the NBA who thought otherwise. Neither, though, are they focused on winning fast to keep Davis in town. Most are nomads themselves and, besides, they have their own ambitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we worry about that,\u201d Pelicans forward Solomon Hill said, \u201cbecause I feel that way for everybody. I don\u2019t just feel that way for Anthony Davis. I feel that way for Jrue Holiday, I feel that way for Tim Frazier. I go out there and compete no matter who\u2019s out there on the floor.\u201d Maybe the narrative can change sooner rather than later, and we\u2019ll be permitted to simply enjoy \u201cunicorns\u201d in all their splendor, free from calculating when they\u2019ll leave and where they\u2019ll go. In the meantime, as an old coach used to say, we\u2019d be wise to congratulate the temporary. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last two weeks of games \u2026 For all videos, press the SLOW-MO button at the bottom right to watch in slow motion. Wed. Dec. 12 \u2013 Thunder @ Pelicans It remains difficult to figure out the New Orleans Pelicans, who haven\u2019t won consecutive games in more than a month and now sit in 13th place in the Western Conference . Their offense remains potent ( they rank fourth in offensive efficiency ), but their ability to get stops has been an issue. Here\u2019s the thing: The Pelicans actually have the same point differential as they had last season (plus-1.3 points per game), when they went 48-34, finishing in a three-way tie for the 4-6 seeds in the Western Conference. But the Pels are a league-worst 5-10 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes after going 30-20 in those games a year ago. Only the Cleveland Cavaliers have seen a bigger drop in winning percentage (a drop that\u2019s much easier to explain) in games that were within five in the last five. The second stop of a four-game trip has the Pelicans in Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday ( 10:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). It\u2019s the first of five straight games against teams ahead of them in the West standings, a critical stretch for a team that has a real sense of urgency in regard to making the playoffs. The Pelicans\u2019 offense is built around Anthony Davis, but his teammates don\u2019t just stand around and watch him go to work. The Pels rank in the top 10 in both player movement (11.7 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession) and ball movement (377 passes per 24 minutes of possession). They may be undersized on the perimeter, but their guards are constantly in motion. And that\u2019s just not in the half-court offense. One thing you\u2019ll see the Pels do in transition is set up a \u201cpistol\u201d action (screen along the sideline), catch their opponent anticipating the screen, and slipping to the basket for a layup. It\u2019s a favorite move of E\u2019Twaun Moore , who catches the Wizards and Mavs in the first two plays below. Moore missed last Wednesday\u2019s game against the Thunder, but Jrue Holiday pulled off the transition slip \u2026 What can go overlooked with these plays is how tough of a pass it is to make. Credit both Holiday and Tim Frazier for finding the right angle. Wed. Dec. 5 \u2013 Spurs @ Lakers DeMar DeRozan is the king of the mid-range. He leads the league with 183 buckets between the restricted area and the 3-point line. In his last season in Toronto, he saw a big increase in the percentage of his shots that came from 3-point range, but that number has dropped from 20 percent last season to just six percent this season with the Spurs . That\u2019s the third biggest drop in 3PA\/FGA among 210 players with at least 300 field goal attempts last season and at least 100 field goal attempts this season. DeRozan wants to get to his spots, and he\u2019s willing to wait to do so. A couple of weeks ago, Tyson Chandler hedged out high on DeRozan-Jakob Poeltl pick-and-rolls on consecutive possessions, keeping DeRozan contained out beyond the arc. And on both possessions, DeRozan just waited Chandler out. On the first, Poeltl sets a second screen going in the other direction, allowing DeRozan to get to his spot before Chandler can recover. On the second, Poeltl slips the initial screen and DeRozan waits for Chandler to retreat before attacking Kyle Kuzma one-on-one. Mon. Dec. 17 \u2013 Suns @ Knicks The Phoenix Suns have won four straight games ! Improvement has mostly come on defense, and better defense can lead to more opportunities in transition. The Suns have a pair of big men \u2013 DeAndre Ayton and Richaun Holmes \u2013 who can run the floor. And in their win in New York on Monday, we saw them rewarded for doing so. On both of the plays below, it\u2019s not the initial ball-handler who gets it to the running big. Both times, a better passing angle is acquired with an initial pass from the middle of the floor to the side. Fri. Dec. 14 \u2013 Thunder @ Nuggets Here\u2019s an interesting back-to-back possession sequence from the Thunder-Nuggets game last Friday. Both plays begin with a Jamal Murray-Nikola Jokic pick-and-roll at the top of the key, with Murray going to his left. On the first, Steven Adams hedges, but gives Murray a little space, which allows him to make a pass to a rolling Jokic at the foul line. That puts the Thunder in rotation (Russell Westbrook helps from the weak side), and Jokic finds a wide-open Torrey Craig in the weak-side corner. On the next possession, Adams hedges a little more aggressively, pushing Murray out, cutting off the passing angle that was there previously, and forcing Jokic to pop back out to the 3-point line to give Murray an outlet. That allows Adams to recover back to his man and the other Thunder defenders to stay at home. Of course, Adams then gives Jokic a little too much space and he drains a three from the top. Mon. Dec. 17 \u2013 Blazers @ Clippers Here\u2019s a simple, but effective three-man action off a baseline out-of-bounds play, run by the Clippers on Monday. Patrick Beverley inbounds out high to Montrezl Harrell, gets a pin-down screen from Tobias Harris, and runs into a dribble hand-off from Harrell, with Damian Lillard trailing. If Beverley was a shooter, he\u2019d have a wide-open look. He\u2019s not, so he waits for Harrell to set a pin-down screen for Harris. That puts Al-Farouq Aminu behind the play and gives Harris the same open look that Beverley had two seconds earlier. John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He made it clear to anyone within earshot and spelled it out for all the folks who would later digest his words on social media. If you are having a conversation about the Kia MVP race entering Christmas Day, Nikola Jokic better be a part of it. Sure, Jokic has never been an All-Star. And there are plenty of casual basketball fans who couldn\u2019t pick him out of a lineup. But make no mistake, Jokic and the Nuggets have arrived. And Malone is a true believer in his versatile big man, the engine that has driven Denver to the top of the Western Conference standings. \u201cI think Nikola is showing everybody in the NBA, with three starters out, that he is a most valuable player candidate,\u201d Malone told The Denver Post after Jokic carved up the Dallas Mavericks Tuesday with a 32-point, 16-rebound, four-assist, three-steal masterpiece. \u201cNot just from a stats standpoint, but he does it every single night in so many different ways. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a special player.\u201d Mavericks rookie Luka Doncic came into the game with some hype, and deservedly so for what he\u2019s done so far in his first season . But it\u2019s Jokic who serves as the league\u2019s real international man of mystery. \u201cSpecial\u201d is the perfect description for a player with Jokic\u2019s sublime game. He\u2019s a lumpy and seemingly lumbering 7-footer who will work foes over, all while they\u2019re trying to figure out how someone so unsuspecting can dazzle as he does. At 23 and just four seasons into his career, he\u2019s the NBA\u2019s best passing big man and can beat you in every phase of the game. He\u2019s the best player on a deep and talented Nuggets team that, at 21-9, is off to the best start in franchise history through 30 games. It\u2019s only fitting, then, that Jokic take his rightful place this week among the latest Kia Race to the MVP Ladder on the strength of the Nuggets\u2019 four-game win streak (wins over the Mavericks, Toronto Raptors , Oklahoma City Thunder and Memphis Grizzlies ). Jokic has posted double-doubles in six straight games and in seven of the Nuggets\u2019 eight games this month. After three days off, Jokic and the Nuggets will get back to it Saturday night in Los Angeles against the Clippers ( 5 ET, NBA League Pass ). Malone has ensured his big man will hit Staples Cnter with a bit more buzz surrounding him after making it his mission to fuel Jokic\u2019s MVP bid. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  26.7 points, 12.9 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 1.3 blocks, 1.3 steals Antetokounmpo and the Bucks are back on a roll, winners of three straight heading into tonight\u2019s road showdown with the Celtics ( 8 ET, ESPN ). This is yet another pre-Christmas statement game opportunity for \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d and his crew (no offense, but starting the Christmas Day festivities against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden doesn\u2019t offer much of an opportunity for statements). Antetokounmpo went toe-to-toe with Anthony Davis in his last outing, finishing with 25 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, two steals and a block. But more importantly, he got the win and then made sure to get in his recruiting pitch for Milwaukee after the game. His actions, however, serve as the best recruiting tool. He dropped 44 points (on 13-for-19 shooting) with 14 rebounds, eight assists and two blocks in a road win against Cleveland to kick off the Bucks\u2019 current streak. He followed that up with 32 points (on 15-for-21 shooting) 12 rebounds, five assists and two blocks in a dominating performance against Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond in Detroit. The Garden crowd on Christmas is in for a treat Tuesday morning. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.8 steals The Raptors continue to win against elite-level competition without Leonard in the lineup, a testament to the quality depth GM Masai Ujiri has assembled in Toronto. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Raptors are a next-level outfit and have the league\u2019s best record whenever Leonard is doing what he does. Even with Fred VanVleet hitting the go-ahead 3-pointer in Wednesday\u2019s comeback win against Indiana , Leonard\u2019s fingerprints were all over the game. He scored 28 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, dished out six assists and collected four steals to help key Toronto\u2019s rally. In back-to-back road losses to Portland and Denver , Leonard piled up the type of numbers that have defined his season when he\u2019s active. He had 28 points, six rebounds and four assists vs. the Trail Blazers and 29 points, 14 rebounds and four assists in the loss to the Nuggets. Tonight\u2019s home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ) should be yet another reminder of how dramatically things have changed for the Raptors and their one-time Eastern Conference playoff nemesis. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  28.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.3 steals Give LeBron his credit \u2014 his timing is already Hollywood perfect. Who else would the Lakers be welcoming into Staples Center tonight other than Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans ( 10:30 ET, ESPN )? NBA Twitter has been waiting all week for this after LeBron\u2019s gushing about how remarkable it would be if the Lakers\u2019 front office could pull off a deal to bring \u201cThe Brow\u201d into the fold . In a week where he\u2019s made bigger headlines for getting a dunk blocked (in Brooklyn) and who he dines with on the road in the New York City (insert Carmelo Anthony jokes and memes here), LeBron is poised to continue his dominance of the headlines through the weekend. That\u2019s because of tonight\u2019s matchup with the Pelicans as well as Christmas Day\u2019s marquee showdown at Oracle Arena with the rival Warriors ( 8 ET, ESPN\/ABC ). Naismith knows what the narratives will surround James this time next week. That said, don\u2019t let the drama fool you. LeBron has been every bit the change agent the Lakers could have hoped he\u2019d be by this time of the season. And if they are indeed interested in an in-season trade, the drama in LA is just getting started. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  29.0 points, 5.3 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.3 steals The Warriors\u2019 season of weird continued Wednesday night in Utah. Golden State lost for the first time in the Curry-Kevin Durant era when the duo went for 30 or more points apiece in the same game. Maybe this really is the come-back-to-earth season for the Warriors, who also lost for the first time this season when holding an opponent under 40 percent shooting. The Jazz also handed the Warriors their 11th loss of the 2017-18 season, but that one came on Jan. 30, 2018 . Golden State is clearly way off its usual mark and when Curry talks of the Warriors needing to get their edge back, it\u2019s no just lip service. The Warriors have seen their quality depth deteriorate over the grind of the past few seasons. And that means the (All-)stars will carry a more rigorous load if they want to avoid the drama that marked their run to The Finals last season (see also: the West finals vs. Houston ). Saturday\u2019s home game against the Dallas Mavericks ( 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass ) is probably a good place for the Warriors to start searching for their (suddenly) elusive edge. Last week:  No. 8 Season stats:  18.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals Any serious conversation about the NBA\u2019s best big man this season must include Jokic. The Nuggets\u2019 7-foot dynamo\u2019s performance as the fuel cell for the best team in the Western Conference heading into the Christmas weekend demands it. While he doesn\u2019t score like some of his contemporaries \u2013 and, quite frankly, isn\u2019t asked to \u2014 he\u2019s more than capable of contributing however Malone needs him to. Over the past five games (26.6 points on 54.9 percent shooting, 33.3 percent shooting on 3-pointers and a 90.3 free throw percentage) he\u2019s shown he\u2019s got the skill set to get it done in that department. Malone and Jokic\u2019s teammates are animated about touting his MVP worthiness, a topic that Jokic has managed to sidestep rather diplomatically thus far. But there won\u2019t be any denying him after the All-Star bids go out. Jokic won\u2019t have to fret over that. His name will certainly be mentioned prominently in that conversation if the Nuggets keep up their winning ways. * * * 6.  Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder 7.  James Harden, Houston Rockets T-8.

Same problem. Chris Paul has another hamstring issue to deal with, and the Houston Rockets are bracing for another stint without their All-Star point guard. Paul will have an MRI in Houston on Friday to determine the severity of the strain in his left hamstring, one that he hurt during the second quarter of the Rockets\u2019 101-99 loss in Miami . \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure it out,\u201d said Rockets guard James Harden, the league\u2019s reigning MVP. \u201cInjuries happen.\u201d Seeing Paul grab at the back of his leg surely conjured up bad reminders of his right hamstring strain late last season, the injury that knocked him out of Games 6 and 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors won both of those games to erase the Rockets\u2019 3-2 lead in the series, and went on to sweep Cleveland for the NBA title. The Rockets are 0-5 without Paul this season and have dropped nine straight when he doesn\u2019t play going back to last season. Including playoffs, the Rockets are 77-22 when Paul plays. \u201cI\u2019ve had hamstring issues before and I know how frustrating they are,\u201d said Heat guard Dwyane Wade, one of Paul\u2019s closest friends in the league. \u201cAnd especially an injury like that \u2026 last year you could say it cost them a championship not having him out there with the hamstring. It\u2019s hard, but I just want him to stay positive. It\u2019s a small hurdle again and you get over it, but it starts mentally first. Physically, I know he will do the work.\u201d Paul is averaging 15.6 points, 8.0 assists and 2.1 steals this season for the Rockets, who host San Antonio on Saturday. His latest injury came on a relatively innocuous-looking play. Paul dribbled behind his back near midcourt while cutting right, and the ball got knocked away by Miami\u2019s Derrick Jones Jr. That was the moment where Paul grabbed the back of his left leg \u2014 the telltale sign of a hamstring issue. He went directly to the Houston locker room, never returned and was dressed and gone before the room opened postgame. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely tough because he\u2019s a big-time playmaker and ball handler for us,\u201d Rockets guard Eric Gordon said. \u201cIn this offense you need all of the playmaking that you can have and usually me, Chris, and James have the ball in our hands trying to play-make for other people and provide good scoring.\u201d Paul is 33, and not even half a season into a four-year, $159.7 million contract that he signed with Houston back in July. He was struggling with his shot of late \u2014 connecting on 34 percent of his tries in his most recent five games entering the matchup in Miami \u2014 but was still a big factor in Houston being able to match a season high with five straight wins. Veteran point guard Brandon Knight played 18 minutes on Thursday after logging no more than eight minutes in any of his four prior games this season. He finished with three points on 1-for-5 shooting and could see a bigger role in the rotation if Paul is out for an extended period of time.  The Rockets were winning by eight in Miami when he got hurt, and got outscored by 10 the rest of the way. And the combined winning percentage of their next nine opponents is .601 \u2014 so being without Paul for a while would obviously make this looming stretch even more daunting for a Rockets team that has been decidedly up and down this season. They lost only 17 regular-season games last season. They\u2019ve nearly matched that already, off to a 16-15 start, and entering Friday are tied for merely the eighth-best record in the jammed Western Conference. The Rockets are two games out of fourth, and two games out of 14th. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tough,\u201d Gordon said of the prospects of being without Paul for a while again. \u201cBut we\u2019ve just got to make adjustments and play even better.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36796,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-12-20-2018","date":"2018-12-21","title":"About Last Night: Another challenge for Rockets","content":"The Rockets saw their five-game win streak come to an end Thursday in Miami, where the Heat held on for a 101-99 victory . As much as the Rockets need wins to dig out of their early-season hole, it wasn\u2019t even close to the worst news of the night. That would be yet another hamstring injury suffered by star point guard Chris Paul. While an immediate prognosis was not available, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said he anticipates Paul will be out for \u201csome time,\u201d an absence his team can ill afford as it attempts to improve on its current spot at eighth in the Western Conference standings. It marks the latest instance in Paul\u2019s seemingly endless battle with his own body. Indeed, Paul has already missed three games this season to soreness in the same left leg he injured Thursday. And it comes on the not-so-distant heels of the right hamstring strain that forced him to miss Games 6 and 7 of the 2018 Western Conference finals . The Rockets lost both of those games, and of course the series. As they muddle through the wilderness of this star-crossed season, one wonders if that was the best shot they\u2019ll have at a championship in their current iteration. It\u2019s also fair to ask whether this is the new norm for Paul, who was injury prone even in his prime. As former NBA executive Bobby Marks noted, this marks his eighth hamstring injury since 2009 alone. Fortunately for Paul, none of his previous hamstring injuries cost him more than seven games. But with 34 rapidly approaching and more than 1,000 games played including the postseason, recovering from setbacks like this isn\u2019t getting any easier. Nor will that provide much comfort for the Rockets, who were just starting to resemble last year\u2019s powerhouse before their floor general \u2014 without whom they\u2019re 0-5 this season, and 15-16 over the past two \u2014 went down. Heat reserve Tyler Johnson turned in one of his best games of the season against the Rockets, highlighted by easily his best sequence of the season:  https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1075958297126162433 The Heat\u2019s victory snapped an 0-6 skid in their gorgeous black \u201cVice Nights\u201d alternates. Not that we didn\u2019t know this already, but budding Mavericks star Luka Doncic is not your typical rookie: Although it wasn\u2019t enough to deliver a Dallas victory, Doncic (32 points, 10-for-20 shooting) finished with the first of what will undoubtedly be many 30-point games to come. Pro tip: When you\u2019re protesting a call, try not to slip and nearly kill yourself. Said Rivers after the game, a 125-121 victory for his Clippers: \u201cI\u2019m hurting. When I went down, the first thing I thought was, \u2018I tore my ACL.\u2019 The doctor said I didn\u2019t, my body said I did, so we\u2019ll find out tomorrow.\u201d It was the kind of news you usually hear regarding Little League pitchers, not NBA players. Kings guard Buddy Hield revealed during a recent interview that he actually turned 26 last Monday, and not 25 as would be the case with the 1993 birth year listed on most sites. Rather than an attempt to deceive NBA executives who were already concerned about his relatively advanced age coming out of Oklahoma in 2016, the Bahamas native said the botched birthday had nothing to do with him. \u201cThat\u2019s their fault, not my fault,\u201d said Hield, who is averaging a career-high 19.9 points per game this season. \u201cThe first time I saw it on Wikipedia, my mom said, \u2018Why do they have your age wrong?\u2019 I said, \u2018I have no idea.\u2019 \u201cI came over with a passport. My passport has 1992 on it. My driver\u2019s license has 1992 on it. I just think people got their information from Wikipedia or wherever, and they just went with it. They just got it wrong.\u201d Per NBC Sports\u2019 James Ham, Kings general manager Vlade Divac was aware of Hield\u2019s correct age.

At 16-7 and in what was seemingly a season of transition, the Clips were tied for first place in the Western Conference. Since then, the Clippers are 1-6, with their only win coming in overtime against the Phoenix Suns. The surprise team of the first seven weeks has slid to sixth place in the West, and the Clips are only four games into a stretch of 10 straight against teams that also have winning records through Wednesday. Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Clippers \u2026 The Clippers have the league\u2019s highest free-throw rate , having attempted 33 free throws for every 100 shots from the field.  This is the fourth straight season in which the Clippers have ranked in the top four in free throw rate, even though the Clippers\u2019 roster is now almost completely different from when they led the league in free throw rate two seasons ago . The only player from that team on this season\u2019s roster is Luc Mbah a Moute, who left for a year, has played a total of 61 minutes this season, and didn\u2019t have much to do with that league-high rate in 2016-17 in the first place. It was DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin who accounted for 40 percent of the Clippers\u2019 free throw attempts two seasons ago, even as both shot worse than that season\u2019s league average (77.2 percent). The Clippers led the league in free throw rate, yet ranked 27th in free throw percentage. This season, Montrezl Harrell leads the Clippers in free throw attempts. He has a free throw rate of 65 attempts per 100 shots from the field, up from 41 per 100 last season. That\u2019s the biggest increase among 208 players with at least 300 field goal attempts last season and at least 100 this season. Harrell has shot just 61 percent from the line, but that\u2019s better than Jordan had ever shot with the Clippers. And the next three Clippers in regard to attempts \u2014 Danilo Gallinari, Lou Williams and Tobias Harris \u2014 each rank among the top 25 in free throw percentage , having shot a combined 91 percent. With the league-high free throw rate and the league\u2019s sixth-best free throw percentage , the Clippers have a top-10 offense, despite having an effective field goal percentage right at the league average. Shooting from the field is the most important aspect of NBA offense, but getting to the line remains the most efficient way to score. The Clippers have outscored their opponents by 3.7 points per game at the line, despite having the 10th-highest opponent free throw rate . Only Jordan\u2019s Mavs (with the former Clipper shooting a career-high 73 percent from the line ) have a better point differential (plus-4.1 per game) on free throws. As the Clippers have gone 1-6 over the last two weeks, they\u2019ve scored just 101.5 points per 100 possessions , down from 113.2 ( fourth in the league ) over their first 23 games. But free throws haven\u2019t been the issue. In fact, they have a higher free throw rate over the last seven games ( 35 attempts per 100 shots from the field ) than they did in their first 23 ( 33 ). The issues have started with turnovers (they have the league\u2019s third-highest rate over the last 15 days) and shooting in the paint, both in regard to volume (they haven\u2019t been getting to the rim as much) and percentage. They\u2019ve been without Williams (sore left hamstring) for the last 4 1\/2 games. He hasn\u2019t been as critical to their offensive success as he was last season \u2014 when they were almost 13 points per 100 possessions better offensively with him on the floor than they were with him off \u2014 but these last seven games, the offense has been pretty terrible with reserves on the floor . The Clippers have also been spending a lot of time away from Staples Center. Prior to this week, they had played 11 of 15 games on the road. Their loss to Portland on Monday began a stretch where they\u2019re 13 of 16 at Staples (including a road game against the Lakers), with only one-game trips to Oakland, Phoenix and Denver. It\u2019s a critical stretch for the Clippers, with Thursday\u2019s game against Dallas ( 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT ) being the fourth of nine straight within the top 11 of the Western Conference.

That playing time is about to grow even more. With Al Horford nursing a knee injury, Williams has started to see his first action, averaging 18 minutes in the Celtics\u2019 last five games. But with Wednesday\u2019s news that Aron Baynes will need surgery for a broken left hand , Williams will likely be called upon to man the middle for Boston. In Wednesday\u2019s surprising loss to the Suns , Williams had the biggest game yet of his young career, scoring eight points, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking five shots in 24 minutes. Asked after the game whether he was ready for his new challenge, the 6-foot-10, 240-pound center from Texas A&M didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cOf course. It\u2019s my job,\u201d Williams said , with a smile upon his face. We\u2019ll definitely be keeping an eye on him, and if his last five games are any indication \u2014 5 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 3.2 bpg in just 18.0 mpg \u2014 there\u2019s no reason Williams couldn\u2019t climb the Ladder. Kyrie Irving, for one, is excited to team up more with the long rookie. \u201cI\u2019ve played with quite a few bigs,\u201d Irving said Wednesday night . \u201cI had Timofey Mozgov, I had Tristan (Thompson) in Cleveland. When I was in college I had Mason and Miles Plumlee. So, you know, having a consistent lob threat at the rim, where you can throw it around the rim and he can go get it, you can see how easy it is for me and Rob. You know going in and people are stepping up on me and he\u2019s always a threat at the rim for (the) offensive rebound and lob. So, I love playing with Rob.\u201d * * * Last week:  No. 1 Here\u2019s a stat to put Doncic\u2019s rookie season so far in some perspective: According to Basketball Reference, Luka Doncic topped 500 career points on Tuesday. With his 188 rebounds and 137 assists, he\u2019s the second player since 1983 to hit 500\/150\/100 by the 28th game of his career. The other? LeBron James. Last week:  No. 3 The Suns are winning \u2014 yes, winning \u2014 and Ayton has been right in the middle of the surprising winning streak. Ayton scored 23 points and grabbed 18 rebounds (tying his season high) Wednesday night as Phoenix surprised Boston 111-103 for its fourth straight win. \u201cThere\u2019s so much positivity,\u201d Ayton said afterward. And why shouldn\u2019t there be? Over the four-game streak, Ayton has been a beast, averaging 17.3 points and 12.0 rebounds while playing off Devin Booker, who played three games this week after a two-week absence. The pair are coming together at the right time, and the recdent trade that brought in Kelly Oubre could add even more of a spark. Last week:  No. 4 Knox continues his climb up the Ladder with another decent week. In four games, Knox averaged 18.3 points and 4.5 rebounds per game on 42.9 percent shooting and 39.3 percent from 3-point land. Knox has struggled with staying aggressive, something coach David Fizdale says is something they\u2019re working on. \u201cThe last two games in a row, it\u2019s happened,\u201d Fizdale said after Knox disappeared in the second half of Monday\u2019s loss to the Suns . \u201cI have to find a way to keep him aggressive. The second half he wasn\u2019t aggressive. He came out the first quarter and got the numbers. We\u2019ll get that straightened out. When I see the high double figures, I know the kid\u2019s coming along and putting together some consistent basketball.\u201d Last week:  No. 2 After soaring up to No. 2 in the Ladder last week, Sexton came back to Earth in his last four games, averaging 10 points while shooting just 36.5 percent overall and 14.3 percent on 3s (1-for-7). Sexton\u2019s shooting woes aren\u2019t the only problem, though. In Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Hornets , Kemba Walker repeatedly burned the young point guard in pick-and-roll situations. \u201cA good game versus a bad game should not be predicated on your points and how many points you score, how many shots you make,\u201d coach Larry Drew said after Sexton struggled to stick with Walker. \u201cYou have to do the other things to affect the game and impact it. And that\u2019s an area where he has to grow.  Last week:  Not ranked It\u2019s time to start giving the Sixers\u2019 rookie his due. While some rookies come in and get a chance to play big minutes on losing teams, others have to find their role and make the most of it. Consider Shamet that guy. Shamet has become a key contributor for the loaded Sixers off the bench, and is tied for the rookie lead in 3-point percentage ( 41.6 percent ) while taking about 4.5 3s in just 20.8 minutes per game. This week, Shamet averaged 10.8 points on 57.7 percent shooting (64.7 percent on 3-pointers) as the Sixers went 2-2 to sit third in the East. Other rookies are getting much of the spotlight, but Shamet isn\u2019t worried about that as he learns under J.J. Redick in a winning environment. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt overlooked,\u201d Shamet told Slam Online . \u201cEven in college, I\u2019ve always felt kind of disrespected and overlooked. That\u2019s how I carry myself even in the NBA. I\u2019m always going to have that chip on my shoulder.\u201d * * * Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies Jackson followed one of his worst games \u2014 three points on 1-for-6 shooting in a Monday loss to the Warriors \u2014 by putting up 16 points, five rebounds and three blocks Wednesday in a 99-92 loss to the Blazers . His inconsistency is the main thing keeping him out of the Top 5 on the Ladder. Trae Young & Kevin Huerter, Atlanta Hawks While Young has been up and down this season, Huerter has emerged as a deadly shooter. Young had 13 points and 10 assists Sunday in the Hawks\u2019 loss to the Nets for his ninth double-double. He then helped the Hawks drop the Wizards on Tuesday night by putting up 19 points on 5-for-11 shooting , going 3-for-6 from beyond the arc. But Huerter had himself a nice week as well, averaging 12 points over the past three games. Unlike Young, though, Huerter has been a consistent shooter, shooting 50 percent from the field (47.1 percent on 3s) this week and is tied with Shamet for the rookie lead in 3-point shooting (41.6 percent). Mo Bamba, Orlando Magic Bamba put up some decent numbers this week in 19.5 minutes off the bench. Bamba averaged 8 points, 6 rebounds (second among rookies in the past week) and 2.3 blocks. He struggled from the field (40 percent), but his work on the defensive end earns him a mention this week. Robert Williams III, Boston Celtics The guy they call Timelord (even though Danny Ainge doesn\u2019t like the nickname ) had his breakout game Dec. 10, grabbing 11 rebounds and blocking three shots in a matchup with Anthony Davis . Four nights later, Williams blocked five shots in just 16 minutes to help Boston beat Atlanta 129-108 . With Wednesday\u2019s five blocks against Phoenix, Williams became just the third rookie to notch multiple five-block games. The other two? Greg Stiemsma, who had four such games in 2012 and Kevin McHale, who had two games in 1981. Rodions Kurucs, Brooklyn Nets The Nets have won seven straight, and Kurucs has started the last four. The No. 40 pick out of Latvia isn\u2019t putting up huge numbers, but we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t make note of his contributions. As a starter, Kurucs has averaged 9.3 points and 4.3 rebounds in 24.6 minutes per game while shooting 52 percent. The 20-year-old\u2019s playing time spiked with Allen Crabbe nursing a knee injury, but coach Kenny Atkinson has said he plans to stick with his \u201cfearless\u201d rookie . \u201cThis is a small pocket of games, but my experience says I believe this will be a season-long thing where he\u2019s getting minutes now,\u201d Atkinson said. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 19 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Twenty-four hours later, it was Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo going directly to the object of so many NBA folks\u2019 affection. As Antetokounmpo exited Fiserv Forum Wednesday night after his Bucks\u2019 123-115 victory over the Pelicans, he came upon Davis talking with a group of family and\/or friends not far from the visitors\u2019 dressing room. \u201cCome to the Bucks, man,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, smiling and shaking Davis\u2019 hand. \u201cCome to the Bucks.\u201d The two All-NBA players, cornerstones of their respective franchises, laughed. But Davis\u2019 future whereabouts is no joke to a lot of nervous New Orleans fans, and neither is the openness with which other teams\u2019 players can recruit the Pelicans\u2019 meal ticket. Teams can and do get fined for violating league tampering rules when they go public with sales pitches or even effusive praise of personnel under contract to other organizations. But the NBA has no precedent of penalizing players for trying to woo opponents, in hopes of turning rivals into teammates. That\u2019s what James did in Brooklyn Tuesday, telling ESPN.com it would be \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cincredible \u201d to play with Davis, presumably in Los Angeles if the Lakers could sign him in free agency in 2020 or acquire him via trade before that. Though he declined to meet with reporters after the loss to the Bucks, Davis did comment on James\u2019 quotes briefly to ESPN before he left the arena. \u201cObviously,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s cool to hear any high-caliber player say they want to play with me. But my job is to turn this team around. If we\u2019re 15-17, that means I\u2019m not doing my job.\u201d Antetokounmpo\u2019s remarks, while made good-naturedly, upped the ante further. What goes around might come around, too. There are those throughout the NBA who might try to recruit Milwaukee\u2019s \u201cGreek Freak\u201d to team up with them in a market larger or more ostensibly appealing. Davis, who scored 27 points with 11 rebounds while coping with some stomach sickness, has a player option in his contract for the 2020-21 season, the earliest he could leave New Orleans unless traded. Antetokounmpo, who had 25 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for Milwaukee, is under contract through 2020-21. \u201cWe\u2019re not trading him,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said emphatically before the game, for the umpteenth time. \u201cI can say that to the world. We\u2019re not gonna trade him, no matter what. That\u2019s not an option. It doesn\u2019t matter what anybody says or does. We\u2019re not trading Anthony Davis. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not trading Giannis.\u201d Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday knows his team\u2019s best hope to championship contention is coveted by the competition. \u201cI mean, everybody wants to [have Davis on their team],\u201d Holiday said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who doesn\u2019t. To us, he\u2019s our franchise player. He\u2019s top three in the world.\u201d Is it distracting to hear and read media speculation about Davis potentially leaving? \u201cNah. I feel like, y\u2019all hear it. We don\u2019t really hear it,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cThe only teams I know about is Boston and the Lakers.

Why y\u2019all looking at me like that?\u2019 Guys told me \u2018You got traded to Memphis.\u2019\u201d Finding out you\u2019ve been traded in the team showers is certainly awkward and not ideal, but it\u2019s probably happened before at some point. Finding out moments later that the trade is off because two players with the same last name were mixed up for each other is unprecedented. \u201cI\u2019m on the bus, on the plane and everybody\u2019s just like, \u2018Man, that was messed up,\u2019\u201d Oubre said, referring to comments made by his Wizards teammates. \u201cNext morning I get a call from Tommy [Sheppard] and Ernie [Grunfeld] saying you\u2019ve been traded, and honestly I was super numb at that time so I didn\u2019t have any feelings towards it.\u201d Well, Celtics fans still have feelings towards Oubre, greeting him to a cacophony of boos in his Phoenix debut despite the 23-year-old wearing a different uniform. Oubre was suspended one game with the Wizards for shoving then-Celtic Kelly Olynyk during a feisty seven-game playoff series in 2017. The Suns\u2019 newest forward fueled Boston fans\u2019 disdain by blowing kisses to the crowd and delivering some impressive highlights, including a block on Kyrie Irving and a clutch 3-point shot with 50 seconds remaining to put the Celtics away. \u201cI did a little extra today cause they don\u2019t really like me here,\u201d he said after the game. The Suns are \u2014 don\u2019t look now \u2014 riding a four-game winning streak. 3-point barrage in Houston  The Rockets set a new NBA record with 26 made 3-pointers en route to a 136-118 victory over the Wizards . With just under three minutes to play, Gary Clark drained a deep 3 to tie the record previously set by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017. The Houston crowd chanted \u201c3\u201d on every following Rockets possession and erupted the moment Michael Carter-Williams set his feet and drilled 3-pointer No. 26 with 31.1 seconds left. James Harden poured in 35 points and hit six 3-pointers to lead the deep-ball avalanche. Chris Paul added five while Eric Gordon and Gerald Green each made four to help lead Houston to its fifth straight win. The Rockets\u2019 offense is clicking on all cylinders, scoring 118.4 points per 100 possessions \u2014 third best in the NBA \u2014 during their winning streak. The team\u2019s engine is on a torrid pace as Harden is averaging 38 points, 7.8 assists and 6.4 rebounds over that span.  Ariza makes return  Wizards forward Trevor Ariza made his return to Houston for the first time since he left in free agency this summer. The talented wingman who played two stints and five total seasons for the Rockets was welcomed to a tribute video and ovation at Toyota Center. https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoustonRockets\/status\/1075562045112647680 Must-see highlights  One night after becoming one of the rare players to deny LeBron James at the rim , Jarrett Allen threw down a nasty poster slam in Chicago. It\u2019s shocking that Wendell Carter Jr. wasn\u2019t able to stuff the attempt considering what he did to Westbrook a few weeks back .  It may be time to retire the saying \u201cvintage Derrick Rose\u201d and just appreciate this greatness we\u2019re witnessing on a consistent basis.  Giannis Antetokounmpo intentionally tried to make a highlight-reel play on Anthony Davis, only to realize why Davis is one of the league\u2019s preeminent shot-blockers. While the dunk wasn\u2019t successful, Antetokounmpo is hoping his recruitment pitch to Davis could be .

A thrilling fourth quarter featured Griffin and Reggie Bullock (10-14 FG) exchanging tough baskets with Derrick Rose and Robert Covington (9-14 FG). The frame ended with Andre Drummond hitting a last-second tip-in to force overtime. Then, the league\u2019s rebound leader drilled a 3-pointer in the extra period to preserve Detroit\u2019s comeback win. Griffin finished with 34 points and Bullock scored a career-high 33. Rose paced Minnesota with 33 points and Covington added 22.

Full list of Top Performers Fox and the hound  De\u2019Aaron Fox made headlines this week when the Kings point guard proclaimed he was the fastest player in the league, even name-dropping Russell Westbrook as someone he\u2019d leave behind in a race baseline to baseline with the ball in their hands. Clearly, the 2016-17 Kia MVP heard those remarks and was hunting for a chance to show off his speed against the Kings. Westbrook shouted \u201cToo fast! I\u2019m too fast\u201d after going coast to coast and driving past Fox to the rim. He\u2019s fast too, but\u2026  Fox also mentioned John Wall as one of the league\u2019s fastest players.

He underwent surgery today to clean up a troublesome right knee injury and, per the team, is expected to be out until approximately the All-Star break . NBA All-Star 2019 runs from Feb. 15-17, with the All-Star break lasting from Feb. 15-21. Dragic\u2019s surgery took 45 minutes and was performed by team physician Dr. Harlan Selesnick at Miami Orthopedics & Sports Medicine Institute at Doctors Hospital. Per Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald and David Furones of the Sun Sentinel , Dragic\u2019s knee had not responded to rest and treatment, which resulted in the need for surgery. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra talked with reporters at Wednesday\u2019s practice and said he\u2019s glad there is a resolution on the horizon for Dragic. \u201cGoran is as dedicated as anybody. He was getting treatment around the clock and it just wasn\u2019t responding the way he wanted to,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe feel good about the fact that there\u2019s a solution now \u2026 This solution is the most promising. We will deal with it and he will be back this season.\u201d Dragic did not play in the Heat\u2019s last game, a 102-96 win against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. That marked the fourth time in five games he sat out with right knee soreness. The last game Dragic played in was on Dec. 10, logging 17 minutes in a 108-105 road loss to the Los Angeles Lakers . Overall, Dragic began the Heat\u2019s six-game road trip out West by slowly working his way back into the mix. He alternated being active for games against the Phoenix Suns and Lakers, but sat out the Dec. 8 game against the LA Clippers that was in between those games. The Heat have been using Josh Richardson, Justise Winslow, James Johnson and Dwyane Wade to handle playmaking duties while Dragic has been out. Per Ira Winderman of the Sun Sentinel , the Heat have declined to say whether or not a point guard would be added to the roster. Dragic missed the final three games of the road trip and there did not seem to be any answers as to how long his setback would be. Before Sunday\u2019s game against the Pelicans, Spoelstra said of Dragic: \u201cHe\u2019s not playing tonight, so our focus is just on the guys that are available.\u201d Dragic was in and out of the locker room on Sunday but declined to talk about his status when asked by reporters. Overall, Dragic has missed 12 of Miami\u2019s past 14 games.

But expecting the Bucks, Thunder, Sixers, Lakers and Blazers all to win on other teams\u2019 courts defies the odds. So I\u2019ll go with this: Fans frustrated with James Harden\u2019s tricky footwork and relentless parade to the foul line are going to get some satisfaction on Christmas. The heavy attention that came from Harden\u2019s stepback-stepback non-travel-call against Utah the other night will be corrected on the national stage by the NBA officials, because seriously, the league needs to get that under control. So I predict a good day for one bearded fellow, a not-so-good day for another on Christmas. Shaun Powell :  Ho, ho, ho, all you basketball fans! Do you really need to stare hard at the unopened package sitting before you? Surely you know what\u2019s inside the box ( it\u2019s Warriors-Lakers in prime time ). Shake it and you\u2019ll hear the roars of Warriors fans and the gasps following a LeBron dunk and rousing ovation after the eighth step-back 3-pointer from Stephen Curry. Hold the box and feel the energy and anticipation. Now open it up in time to see Kevin Durant swishing the game-winner right before the sleigh bells ring. Merry Christmas! John Schuhmann :  Unfortunately, I can\u2019t guarantee anything. But as things look right now, we\u2019re getting healthy rosters for most of the teams involved, with Al Horford the only good player on a good team that we should be worried about. The Lakers are set to get Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo back later this week, and the Warriors got their stars back in time for their first regular-season meeting with LeBron James in a Lakers uniform. Now, we can only hope for close games in Houston, Boston and Oakland to make it a really fun evening.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019ve already granted your Christmas wishes, NBA fans. You\u2019ve seen the line up for the big day. I\u2019m delivering a Lakers-Warriors matchup that gives everyone something to look forward to after you tear open those other gifts and polish off the food from Christmas brunch. LeBron and his Los Angeles Lakers invading Oracle Arena for a matchup against Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and the two-time defending champions is the ideal way to spend the holiday enjoying the spectacle that always is LeBron facing the Warriors."},{"id":36799,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-high-can-durant-go-all-time-scoring-list","date":"2018-12-19","title":"Blogtable: Where will Durant finish his career on all-time scoring list?","content":" * * * Kevin Durant has passed Larry Bird and now sits at No. 33 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . How high can he go? * * * Steve Aschburner :  Hey, I was told there\u2019d be no math on these blogtables! OK, let\u2019s see: Durant is 30. He\u2019s in terrific shape and should age well, but he\u2019s had his share of structural injuries. He might end up as the cornerstone guy if he changes teams again, though I suspect he won\u2019t go anywhere where he doesn\u2019t have significant scoring help. Now let\u2019s assign numbers: I figure him for eight more seasons, at an average of 65 games per season, at an average of 21 points per game (based on a few points-per-game more now, a few less from ages 36-38). That\u2019s 10,920 points after this season, added to another 1,000 or so to come this season. That\u2019s another 12,000 points, which would put him at 33,806, just beyond Kobe Bryant\u2019s 33,643. Bryant is third now but LeBron James is going to pass him first, so Durant will end up fourth all-time when he retires. Shaun Powell :  The future of Kevin Durant on the scoring charts depends on a few factors, namely health and also whether Father Time is a big Durant fan. Anyway, he\u2019s certainly on track to crack the top 10 while still clinging to his prime and maybe top three before the wheels fall off , although we should mention that LeBron James is still adding to his own total and who knows where this is going? John Schuhmann :  Top 10 is a sure thing. To get into the top three (by passing Kobe Bryant), he\u2019d have to stay relatively healthy (65 games or more every season), continue to average 26 or 27 points per game over the next few years, and play until he\u2019s 37. The one season (2014-15) where he missed 55 games (after averaging 32 points per game the season before) really hurts his ability to reach Karl Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, or wherever LeBron James finishes, but maybe a move (at the age of 31) to a team that needs his scoring more than the Warriors do would give him a boost.  Sekou Smith :  In a best-case scenario, Durant is ticketed for a top three or four finish if he continues to stay healthy and score at an elite level. That should not be an issue for a player who is easily one of the most gifted and skilled offensive performers ever. But who knows what happens if Durant takes his elsewhere in free agency and doesn\u2019t have to share the scoring load the way he does with the Warriors. Listening to Durant talk about his love and appreciation for the art of scoring in this league, I see a guaranteed top 10 finish as a baseline for a player who continues to hone his craft the way Durant does."},{"id":36794,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-will-kings-bagley-fox-become-next-durant-westbrook","date":"2018-12-19","title":"Blogtable: Will Bagley-Fox become next Durant-Westbrook?","content":" * * * Dave Joerger says the Kings have the next Durant-Westbrook duo in Marvin Bagley III and De\u2019Aaron Fox. What say you?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Be careful what you wish for. You want all that drama? You want to have traded away a scoring leader and a future Kia MVP in order to afford your two stars? You want a breakup of the tandem itself eventually? Maybe the Kings think they can have all the goodness of Durant-Westbrook with none of the down side, using Oklahoma City\u2019s experience as a blueprint for things to avoid. But they and their young potential stars have a long, long way to go. I\u2019ll leave it at that, except to say, I remember when the NBA standards for duos were Gary Payton-Shawn Kemp, John Stockton-Karl Malone and Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen. (Bob Cousy-Bill Russell and Jerry West-Elgin Baylor were before my time.) Shaun Powell :  I say Joeger needs to step away from the Jager . It\u2019s far too early to put a pair of young up-and-comers in the same sentence as a pair of MVPs; isn\u2019t that what coaches and players criticize the media (and fans) for doing? And ask Kings fans to put their hands on a Bible and say they\u2019d rather have Bagley instead of Luka Doncic, whom the Kings passed in the draft. That said \u2026 Fox is a straight-up baller and Bagley looks promising. Give them time first and then, if they\u2019ve earned it, give them their due. John Schuhmann :  I say that Mr. Joerger is overcompensating for his previous comments about how good Luka Doncic is and will be. I know he\u2019s talking about the pair being the foundation for the franchise going forward, but any comparison to Durant is kind of silly. Bagley has some nice skills (good hands and good feet) around the basket. As a rookie, he\u2019s one of 16 players (a list that includes two other rookies) who have shot better than 70 percent on at least 100 shots in the restricted area, and he should eventually be a versatile big man who makes an impact on both ends of the floor. But Durant led the Thunder to The Finals at the age of 23 and may just be the best one-on-one scorer in NBA history, with a impossible-to-stop combination of size and skills. That\u2019s a name to avoid when making comparisons to young players.  Sekou Smith :  I \u2018d love to know who spiked Joerger\u2019s egg nog. That said, I appreciate any coach who champions the cause of his young players and attempts to set the bar as high as Joerger has for Fox and Bagley. Player comparisons are my least favorite aspect of the ongoing evaluation of NBA players. We get locked into a narrative about who and what a player is supposed to be, which often distorts the clearer view of what\u2019s really going on in these youngsters\u2019 growth and development. The Kings have some quality, young talent on their roster. They finally look ready to turn the corner and I don\u2019t want anything to get in the way of that progress. But if Joerger is right, and the Kings do have a dynamic duo capable of playing, winning and just operating at the elite level Durant and Westbrook have enjoyed over their careers? If that\u2019s true, good for them. Their fans certainly deserve to dream big like that."},{"id":36781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-waive-guard-austin-rivers","date":"2018-12-19","title":"Report: Grizzlies not interested in adding Rivers","content":" The Phoenix Suns have waived guard Austin Rivers, a day after he was obtained in a trade with the Washington Wizards.

If that\u2019s not poetic justice, what is? Here\u2019s a player who was the perfect fit on a championship-contending team in Houston, but chose money last summer during free agency and signed with the Suns . They subsequently tanked and realized giving him $15 million was a big mistake, so they bailed after 26 games and shipped him to another of his former teams , the Wizards, who need a wake-up call. His journey is almost as exhausting as it was to write that last sentence. > Watch free On NBA League Pass:  Wizards vs. Rockets (8 ET) A nutty NBA season has nothing on Ariza\u2019s bouncy path littered with dollars, defeats, uncertainty and (surely) misery, or as miserable as a rich player can get. Just last May he was a game away from reaching The Finals. Now he\u2019s being asked to make sense of the weirdo Wizards while dealing with scar tissue from a disastrous experience in Phoenix. And he\u2019s not on the team he reportedly really wants to be with , the Lakers. This is a story of a middle-aged player who jumped at his last chance for a big payday at the expense of winning. It\u2019s also one of a team (the Rockets) that underestimated his value to them, and another team (the Suns) that overestimated his value to them , and a third team (the Wizards) that may soon realize he\u2019s an answer but not the answer to their problems. That sound about right? \u201cI try not to think of it that way,\u201d Ariza said about his path to his third team since summer. \u201cI take it one day at a time, every obstacle as it comes, and whatever situation comes my way I try to handle it accordingly.\u201d First, know that Ariza is a versatile wingman who makes analytics swoon because he shoots 3s and defends the perimeter. He adjusted his game to fit the NBA trend, becoming a reliable catch-and-shoot player ( 40.3 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season) who can defend guards and forwards. But at 33, Ariza\u2019s perhaps past his prime and can only impact certain teams (as proof, nobody was willing to give him a multiyear, big-money deal last summer). He was great for the Rockets at $9 million a season and overpriced for the Suns at almost twice that amount. He left the Rockets because they ran out of money last summer, or at least more than they were willing to pay him. They gave Chris Paul a max contract last summer even though Paul can\u2019t stay healthy and will make $44 million as a 36-year-old. But the Rockets likely promised Paul that deal when they traded for him two summers ago. They also gave Clint Capela a reported $90 million over five years because he\u2019s a good center, which in today\u2019s NBA is like being the skinniest guy at a fat man\u2019s convention. Some players in that situation might grit their teeth and re-signed. But Ariza has never cashed in big (relatively speaking) in his career and the Suns came running with $15 million for some unexplained reason. Phoenix didn\u2019t need Ariza at any price because (a) the Suns are stocked with young players at his position who need to be developed, and (b) they weren\u2019t a veteran away from doing anything special. As we\u2019ve seen, they still aren\u2019t. It didn\u2019t make sense for Phoenix (this was the last deal by doomed general manager Ryan McDonough, who was fired in early October ) and only made financial sense for Ariza. Overall, he played poorly for the Suns, shooting a career-worst 35.3 percent. But since this is professional sports and careers are short, Ariza chose to make money and deal with losing, which means he earned exactly what he got. Ariza lost more games in one month in Phoenix than he did all season with the Rockets. But he knew that when he signed up for it. The Suns were never built to win now. \u201cThe (Wizards) couldn\u2019t be struggling any more than I was going through,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cLosing is always tough no matter where you are, so that wasn\u2019t comfortable at all. I didn\u2019t go into that situation with any expectations. I was just going to try to help the players get better and the team to improve. That\u2019s it.\u201d Some NBA personnel people saw this as a case where a player knew he could get the money and eventually a better team because, with an expiring contract, Ariza qualified as a prime trade asset. If that was the master plan, it worked \u2026 sort of. Ariza did get traded, but to the Wizards \u2014 and not to the Lakers, Rockets or any of the other contenders who sniffed around. Ordinarily, the Wizards wouldn\u2019t have interest, either, in a player who\u2019s just a stopgap guy. They envisioned a longer relationship with Kelly Oubre Jr., who\u2019s 10 years younger. But they shipped Oubre to Phoenix in the Ariza trade because they weren\u2019t in position to pay him next summer when he becomes a restricted free agent. The Wizards\u2019 money is spent on Otto Porter Jr., whom they retained after matching a $106 million offer sheet by Brooklyn in 2017. That essentially made Oubre, who plays the same position as Porter Jr., a goner in Washington. And that\u2019s come to symbolize the Wizards\u2019 issue right now: The only bang for the buck they\u2019re getting is an exploding cigar. They\u2019ve got the sixth-highest payroll in the NBA and the league\u2019s sixth-worst record . Porter, Bradley Beal (due $107 million more) and John Wall ($207 million) have combined to do little for the basketball pulse in D.C. and still have yet to cause much of a ripple in the relatively weak Eastern Conference. The Wizards need \u2026 something. A spark, a splash of cold water to the face, anything to roust the talent on a club where the core players are all in their prime (and two of them, Beal and Wall, are All-Stars). The hope is that Ariza can perhaps recharge the Wizards \u2014 something he couldn\u2019t do in Phoenix.  \u201cWe\u2019re excited about having him,\u201d said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best wing defenders in the league. He brings that professionalism every night, a winner. We\u2019re having a tough start and a guy like him can help us play better because he brings consistent effort on both ends and knows his role. I told him if he\u2019s open, shoot it. His length, outside shooting, toughness, defense and experience, we need that. He\u2019s done it for a lot of years.\u201d It helps that there\u2019s a bit of nostalgic karma at work here. Ariza was with the Wizards in 2013-14 and helped them make the playoffs. He also helped Beal and Wall grow up, mentoring them on the finer points of being an NBA player. They\u2019re both thrilled to have Ariza back. \u201cHe can play at a high level, knock down shots, does all the little things defensively to change a team,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBrad and I have grown up a lot since then. Trevor helped us then and I think he can help us get over the hump now.\u201d Wall believes the Wizards are a win streak away from righting their ship and hopes that will happen once Ariza returns to his Rockets form. He can hopefully rev up a defense that ranks in the bottom five in Defensive Rating, Rebound Percentage while allowing tons of fast-break and second-chance points . Wall also notes that in the East, where the only beast might be Toronto, the season is never over in December. There are other teams in Washington\u2019s situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tough road where we\u2019ve needed to know what we want to do with our team,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWhen we get healthy and everybody plays their roles I think we can be a team that wins 50 games. Right now it doesn\u2019t look like it, but a couple years ago we won 17 games in a row at home. We can catch fire. We know where to do, we just got to do it now. There\u2019s no time to be waiting.\u201d Their season can\u2019t be any more insane than Ariza\u2019s has been so far. Maybe they\u2019ll be good for each other and this reunion will prove to be destiny. Maybe they\u2019ll stabilize each other\u2019s basketball lives and even better, make sense of it. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Riding a seven-game winning streak, the Indiana Pacers were looking to continue their climb in the Eastern Conference standings. A home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers seemed like a favorable spot. And then Larry Nance Jr. happened. Nance stuffed the stat sheet with 15 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, six assists and the first game-winning shot of his pro career to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a rare 92-91 road victory. DIFFICULTY: After outwrestling Victor Oladipo in front of the basket, Nance waited patiently as he anticipated Rodney Hood\u2019s errant jumper then threw up his right hand and beat the buzzer. \u201cI told Hood to put the ball up on the rim with a couple seconds left so I can see if I could do something with it,\u201d Nance said. \u201cHe made a good move and did exactly that. I was lucky enough to get a hand on it and then direct it in.\u201d GAME SITUATION: Victor Oladipo missed two free throws with 9.5 seconds left, opening the door for Cleveland. On the game\u2019s final possession, the play was drawn up for Hood, who went one on one with his defender. His jumper in the lane missed, but Nance was there to clean it up and give his team the dramatic victory. CELEBRATION: The buzzer-beater set off a wild scene in which Cavs players began mobbing Nance before the replay review confirmed the call. Even some of Cleveland\u2019s injured players joined the party as the stunned crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse looked on. Moment laters, Nance got doused by teammates during the postgame interview. GRADE: Playing without three of their top five leading scorers (Kevin Love, Jordan Clarkson and Tristan Thompson), this was an improbable win for the Cavs, who haven\u2019t had much to celebrate this season. And considering how hot the Pacers had been, this was one of the bigger upsets of the season. Three Horrys.  Instead of being turned into a poster, Nets center Jarrett Allen did something only a handful of players have ever done: reject a dunk attempt from LeBron James. The Nets went on to beat the Lakers 115-100 , extending their longest winning streak in nearly four years to six games. James finished with 36 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists and put his spin on the stunning rejection. \u201cHe\u2019s in his twenties, I\u2019m in my thirties. It takes me a little longer to get warmed up, but that\u2019s fine,\u201d James said, per Anthony Puccio of NetsDaily. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a shot blocker, I\u2019m sure you can get a block.

A few dozen feet to his left is where he took the biggest shot of the 2010 Finals , and a few dozen feet to his right is where he thanked his therapist for giving him the strength to swish it. >Tuesday on NBA TV: Beyond the Paint, 11 p.m. ET He is perfectly positioned in the middle of two life-changing events, and therefore you can safely conclude that he\u2019s feeling balanced right now. The former All-Star \u2014 who on a whim renamed himself Metta World Peace, but cheerfully still answers to Ron \u2014 is at peace. You can see it in his eyes, his handshake, his smile, his skip in his step. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he says. \u201cYou?\u201d What about the demons? Well, they never really left him. They hibernate and lurk and stay on standby. Lord, how those demons created a mess for him. At times they nearly stole his soul, although it is the now-retired Artest who is winning that war. He\u2019s moving forward \u2014 triumphantly and surprisingly so, you soon learn \u2014 while never too embarrassed or hesitant to survey what he left behind. And that\u2019s the thing with Artest: He\u2019s open to discussing how, in the prime of his life, he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he wanted to play ball , how much longer he wanted to live. It was on June 17, 2010, the best night ever, with the world watching and listening, that he revealed how he was receiving treatment for mental illness. In this case, it was anxiety and depression, a pair that tag-teamed him since he was a kid, that Artest was seeking to slay. This is a personal issue that most folks, to use a term, keep on the low-low. Artest, now 39, is not most folks. As the confetti still helicoptered from the ceiling, and with his jersey still moist from the Game 7 sweat caused by a tense Lakers title victory over the Boston Celtics, Artest went on and on about his improved mental health and how it played a part. Little did anyone realize it then, but eight years ago a movement in the NBA was born. A cause was created, a stigma lifted, all because Artest rambled. It\u2019s OK now to tell the world that you need therapy. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re a physically strong professional athlete to admit having a mental illness. A hidden door opened and sympathy and understanding rushed in. There is Kevin Love, pouring his heart out about his own mental healt h. And DeMar DeRozan, another All-Star, stepping forward and making a statement . Keyon Dooling detailing his rebound from childhood sexual abuse and the havoc it caused him. And Chamique Holdsclaw, one of the greatest female basketball players ever, revealing her struggles and explaining how therapy saved her from emotional ruin . Their tales, all different to a degree, share the same path, which leads to the search for relief, a road paved in part by Artest. Asked about fellow players and people from other walks of life emerging from the shadows to tell their stories, Artest sounds like someone who feels a great sense of satisfaction. \u201cI thought it was good that they did that,\u201d he says. \u201cNBA players are just normal people. They deserve to be treated as normal, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to be normal when you\u2019re playing at the highest level and playing before millions of people. What Kevin and DeMar did was normalize what they were going through. And people who were going through the same issues, people who weren\u2019t as famous, could relate to them. \u201cKevin and DeMar are equally important to this awareness as myself. It\u2019s about human life. About Kevin and DeMar making athletes feel more comfortable. They\u2019re getting people to talk about it.\u201d Artest almost sounds as if he has a doctorate in psychology. And while he never took a class in that, he spent countless hours being tutored. The words come freely with no hesitation. You ask, he tells. And there is much to say. At his highest point athletically, Artest was one of the league\u2019s premier two-way players, the Kawhi Leonard of his day. Tough, fearless and determined, Artest was hell on anyone dribbling the ball and won Defensive Player of the Year in 2003-04. He also could rebound (6.5 rpg with the Sacramento Kings in 2006-07), pass and score. He averaged 20.5 ppg in 2007-08 and played 17 NBA seasons. His signature moment came later in his career, though. He bailed out Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, who misfired throughout Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, and his shot put the bow on the Lakers\u2019 16th and most recent championship. Artest took a pass, and from the deep corner launched the 3-pointer that extended the Lakers\u2019 lead and put the champagne on ice. Of course, those peaks were dwarfed by the fateful night in the Detroit suburbs when he went on a rampage through the stands. \u201cThe Malice at the Palace\u201d in 2004 has its own carved-out space in NBA dishonor, with Artest serving as the ringleader who sent part of America tsk-tsking about race and sports violence and losing control. He was suspended for the remainder of the 2004-05 season on Nov. 21, 2004 and estimates that night cost him $50 million in fines, future salary and endorsements. He earned a 7-game suspension in 2012 when he delivered an unsolicited (and vicious) elbow to then-Oklahoma City Thunder guard James Harden. Those were a few of the multiple acts of misbehavior from a player who stamped a reputation for himself. \u201cShowing up to practice and disrupting practice, showing up a coach or a teammate, just going over the line,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things I wish I had done differently. But maybe I couldn\u2019t at that time. I felt trapped.\u201d My introduction to Artest came when he was 18; he was a freshman at St. John\u2019s University, I was a sports columnist at Newsday . It was inside a locker room at the United Center in Chicago, moments after St. John\u2019s was eliminated from the NCAA tournament. In one corner was Felipe Lopez, the former New York schoolboy sensation who\u2019d just played his final college game, shaking and sobbing into a towel. In another corner was Artest, a far less-celebrated New York schoolboy sensation, eyes dry and open wide. Losing a basketball game caused some ache but this was hardly the definition of pain for someone from Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in America. Artest certainly saw and heard and felt worse in a neighborhood where a fist to the face, or something more sinister, wasn\u2019t far away. His world changed when his parents divorced while he was still a boy, and he had an often-troubled relationship with his father. Thrown for a loop, Artest lost control. \u201cI always had anger issues because that\u2019s all I grew up around, anger,\u201d he says. \u201cI also had love and that\u2019s why people see two sides from me. I saw my parents happy and mad. I grew up with friends who were happy and the next moment guns were firing. As a kid it was unbalanced and confusing. There was never a chance to relax. It was just get up and see what\u2019s going to happen today. I might have a good day. I might wake up on the other side of the bed. I was suspended in nursery school, kindergarten, first through 12th grade every year for fighting. In college I got in trouble and in the NBA I was in trouble for something or another every year except my last year.\u201d There was always a charming side to Artest, whose alter-ego behavior was often rationalized as just being different, innocent, quirky. Like when he applied for a job at an electronics store during his rookie season with the Chicago Bulls so he could get the employee discount. Or when he asked the Pacers, his next team, for time off during the season so he could go on a promotional tour for his eponymous rap album . Fun, goofy stuff like that. Something else simmered underneath, though, and initially Artest struggled to come to grips with it. He knew he wasn\u2019t right, and while he spoke with counselors during his high school and college days, he didn\u2019t receive the deep-diving psychological help that his condition demanded until much later. When he finally received professional help, he was forced to do so: One of the court-ordered conditions for Artest after being sentenced to 20 days in jail (he served 10) for domestic violence in 2007, when he played for the Kings, was examination for anger management and other possible mental health issues. Artest has had regular visits ever since. \u201cI was the best two-way player in the league at 24,\u201d he says. \u201cI was also spiraling downward emotionally. My emotions were eating away at my skills. Like a parasite eating away at your body. It was eating away at my skill and my work habits and my mental focus and my discipline. \u201cBefore I got into the brawl I wanted to retire . I requested papers to file to the NBA. I knew something was terribly wrong and nobody really knew. The league called and asked if I really wanted to do this. I needed time away because I couldn\u2019t get a hold of myself. There were so many things bothering me, so many things I couldn\u2019t handle: Taking care of so many people, wanting to have fun, not being a loyal partner with my now ex-wife \u2026 I said, \u2018OK, I need a break. I need to put my life in order.\u2019 I didn\u2019t go through with retirement but I wish I did. It wasn\u2019t about the money. I was going crazy by 2008.\u201d Right around that time, Artest began taking an active role in the mental-health movement. He lent his name to the cause. He spoke with experts in the field. He met with city officials in Sacramento and urged them to promote mental health awareness in the public schools, stressing that early recognition is the key. He fed his curiosity by reading, learning, probing. Artest was part of the California movement to adopt lime green as the color for mental health awareness and is active during May, the month designated to observe awareness. It\u2019s all designed to help those suffering from, but not limited to, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia. \u201cI was doing it because there was a lot of people out there who needed some help and they weren\u2019t getting it,\u201d he said. Artest became a regular patient for therapists in Sacramento, Houston and LA when he began bouncing from team to team once his career reached the sunset years. Without therapy, Artest was asked if he\u2019d be in position to take the shot that won a championship. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says. What happened next was the actions of a changed man who still kept his quirk: He put his championship ring up for raffle nationwide in 2009 , with the proceeds helping to fund mental health charities. With a minimum purchase of five tickets at $2 each, the contest raised $651,000, far more than what the ring would\u2019ve fetched in a straight auction. The winner was a man from nearby working-class Hawthorne named Raymond Mikhael ; he bought $100 worth of tickets. In an emotional speech while accepting the ring, he cited his mother, a schizophrenic, as the motivation for participating in the raffle, and that nearly bought Artest to tears. As for the ring itself, Artest says he doesn\u2019t have any regrets for selling it off. \u201cI never tried to replace the ring with a copy, either,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t care about jewelry. I just wanted to win a title. I played basketball so I wouldn\u2019t have to sell drugs or guns and stuff. When I started, I wasn\u2019t playing for the love of the game. I was playing so I wouldn\u2019t have to go to jail.\u201d He\u2019s a father to four kids and recently became a grandfather with the birth of his eldest daughter, Sade\u2019s, first child. One of his sons, Jeron, is a high-scoring high school player and, depending on the college board exams, the Ivy League could be in his future. Artest\u2019s post-playing career might surprise some. He put a brother through law school. He has a CPA division in his company, The Artest Management Group , where his firm helps athletes with tax preparation. The company also has a film division. Artest has been a mathematics wiz since high school \u2014 think of the Matt Damon character in \u201cGood Will Hunting.\u201d He\u2019s using those skills to develop a sports app and is taking analytics classes at UCLA. \u201cIt\u2019s like basketball all over again,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m putting everything into it, every fight and grit that I put on the defensive floor. I\u2019ve turned it on mentally. We\u2019re grinding. It reminds me of when I was 13 and trying to figure out how to learn how to play basketball.\u201d Artest wanted to create a relaxed workplace environment, and so his employees enjoy a side benefit: Once a month, a psychologist is on property for anyone seeking relief, and at least one person on staff signs up each time. \u201cI actually enjoy therapy,\u201d says the boss. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Rockets\u2019 defense, vital to their near-Finals run last year, went AWOL. Ditto for the Jazz, who have augmented that underachievement with an anemic offense that ranks 24th in the league. The pair of Western Conference misfits met in Houston on Monday, and it was there the Rockets proved their season might finally be turning around for the better in their 102-97 win over Utah. Harden is the combustible gas fueling the Rockets to life. Four nights after dropping a 50-point triple-double on the Lakers, the reigning Kia MVP netted 47 points at Utah\u2019s expense. Everything is working for Harden \u2014 even his double-step-back jumper that had social media up in arms. Dubious dribble moves aside, Harden (39.5 ppg) has been nothing short of superb over Houston\u2019s four-game winning streak. The Rockets\u2019 defense hasn\u2019t been terrible, either, ranking a respectable 13th in that span after sitting at 25th through Dec. 9. As for the Jazz (14-17), they\u2019ve yet to find Donovan Mitchell\u2019s jump shot (8 for 22 Monday, 42.6 percent on the season) or any other source of reliable offensive output. For now, Houston seems at least on the verge of a permanent answer, while Utah \u2014 now 14th in the West \u2014 is still riddled with questions. Thirty years ago, the league was still struggling to find an answer for Larry Joe Bird, whose Celtics had dominated the East to the tune of four straight Finals appearances. Fast forward to 2018, and you\u2019ll find Kevin Durant tormenting defenses on a similarly dominant super team. Fittingly, the two-time Finals MVP passed No. 33 for 33rd on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . Warriors teammate Stephen Curry, meanwhile, splashed past 15,000 career points with (you guessed it) an absurdly deep 3-pointer. A 2001 Draft pick, Jamal Crawford has been in the league a while. But the three-time Kia Sixth Man Award winner knows of and respects his historic predecessors. Crawford\u2019s pregame homage to Walt Frazier must have pleased the Madison Square Garden gods, because they gave the 38-year-old the foresight to dish out a career-high 14 assists in Phoenix\u2019s 128-110 victory . It\u2019s not the first time MSG has witnessed Crawford set a personal best. The former Knick\u2019s career best of 52 points also occurred at New York, albeit for the home team. Minnesota didn\u2019t waste much time with Sacramento, jumping out to a 36-point first-half lead before cruising to a 132-105 win . This wasn\u2019t a case of just one guy torching the Kings. Nine different Timberwolves scored in double-figures, with four of them \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose and Tyus Jones \u2014 winding up with double-doubles in the process. Shoes come off. It happens. What normally doesn\u2019t follow is Taj Gibson\u2019s apparel-assisted brand of defense. Sacramento didn\u2019t have a fun night, but Troy Williams had himself a highlight by faking out not one, not two, but three defenders with this pivot gem."},{"id":36826,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-exercise-contract-option-billy-donovan","date":"2018-12-18","title":"Thunder exercise 5th-year option on coach Billy Donovan's contract","content":" OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 The Oklahoma City Thunder have exercised their fifth-year option on coach Billy Donovan\u2019s contract.

As they regain their ways as a team, their roster is also slowly becoming whole again, too. Per Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle , Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston will play tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies. Ron Kroichick of the San Francisco Chronicle reported early Monday both players were expected to suit up tonight after they practiced on Sunday. Iguodala has been out the last three games with tightness in his left hip, while Livingston missed Friday\u2019s win against the Sacramento Kings because of a bruised pelvis. To date, Livingston has played in just 20 of Golden State\u2019s first 30 games. His absences are mostly due to a foot injury that sidelined him in late October and early November. \u201cI feel good,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of the lineup a lot more this year, injury-wise. \u2026 Some years, you have nagging injuries, especially as you start to get older. I\u2019m just going with the flow and trying to take care of my body.\u201d Aside from those veterans returning to the mix, center DeMarcus Cousins continues to work toward his season debut for the Warriors. The big man, who was Golden State\u2019s blockbuster addition in free agency, took part in Sunday\u2019s practice and played star Kevin Durant in a quick, friendly game of one-on-one afterward. Cousins has also logged some practice time with the Warriors\u2019 G League affiliate, the Santa Cruz Warriors, since being assigned there last week as part of his rehab work. Per the San Francisco Chronicle , Cousins will take part in Santa Cruz\u2019s practice on Monday in part because those workouts include full-court, 5-on-5 scrimmages. After the practice, Cousins is expected to be back in time to take in Monday\u2019s game against Memphis. Livingston said he has seen progress from Cousins as he continues on his rehab trail. \u201cI like his body language more than anything, you know,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cHe\u2019s just staying confident in himself, trying to be more positive. You could tell it\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019ve been there \u2026 when you can\u2019t really move the way you want to move, and then also he\u2019s a basketball player that\u2019s not playing in the game, not playing basketball.\u201d \u201cYou know, it\u2019s easy to have a funky attitude, you know, because it\u2019s not really going his way. But, he\u2019s trending in the right direction.\u201d Golden State is currently No. 2 in the Western Conference , 1\/2 game behind the Denver Nuggets."},{"id":36838,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-all-star-voting-tips-official-release","date":"2018-12-17","title":"NBA All-Star voting 2019 presented by Google tips off on Christmas Day","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 NBA All-Star Voting 2019 presented by Google, which is now the league\u2019s presenting NBA All-Star Voting partner through a new multiyear agreement, will tip off on Tuesday, Dec. 25 at 11 a.m. ET \u2014 before five Christmas Day matchups across ABC and ESPN \u2014 and conclude on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, Jan. 21 at 11:59 p.m. ET.

He averaged 12.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting .393 from three-point range with the team from 2012-2014, helping the team advance to the second round of the playoffs in 2013-14. The 15-year veteran has averaged 10.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting .353 from three-point range in 968 career games (667 starts) over 15 seasons with Phoenix, Houston, Washington, New Orleans, the L.A. Lakers, Orlando and New York. He has averaged 9.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.5 steals in 26 games (all starts) with the Suns this season. Over the past 10 seasons (entering the 2018-19 season), Ariza had 1,304 three-pointers and 30.5 defensive win shares (estimate of number of wins contributed by a player due to his defense), joining LeBron James and Kevin Durant as the only players to post those numbers. He has also averaged at least 2.0 three-pointers and 1.5 steals in each of the past five seasons (coming into the 2018-19 season), joining Stephen Curry and James Harden as the only players to do so. Dating back to 2008-09, Ariza has the third-most steals (1,245) in the NBA behind only Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook and he joins Harden and Westbrook as the only players with at least 4,000 points, 2,000 rebounds, 800 assists and 600 steals since 2013. Ariza brings extensive playoff experience to the Wizards, averaging 10.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.4 steals while shooting .367 from three-point range in 102 postseason contests (90 starts). He helped lead the Lakers to the 2009 NBA championship, averaging 11.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals while shooting .476 from three-point range in 23 games (all starts) and helped lead the Rockets to the Western Conference Finals in both 2015 and 2018, starting all 34 games in those combined playoff runs. Oubre, who was originally acquired in a draft night trade by Washington in 2015, averaged 8.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 252 games over his Wizards career. He was averaging 12.9 points and 4.4 rebounds through 29 games this season.

Washington officially agreed on Monday to acquire Ariza from the Phoenix Suns for Kelly Oubre Jr. and Austin Rivers. This Ariza trade came together hours after a potential three-way deal involving the Grizzlies fell apart late Friday night over whether Memphis was including Dillon Brooks or MarShon Brooks. The saga included general managers informing players they\u2019d been traded, awkward conversations to explain they weren\u2019t and finally the talks coming to an end. Wizards players went through the emotional roller coaster of the failed trade after their loss at Brooklyn as Oubre and Rivers were still on the team bus to the airport and the flight home. \u201cWe all understand it\u2019s a business,\u201d guard John Wall said after practice Saturday. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen, when it\u2019s going to happen. The first time I\u2019ve ever seen a trade go dead and guys are on a bus talking about it. Kind of devastating for those guys.\u201d Ariza, 33, returns to Washington, where he played the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. The 6-foot-8, 215-pound swingman is averaging 9.9 points, 5.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 26 games with the Suns this season, the last remaining on his contract. Phoenix forward Josh Jackson called Ariza \u201cthe ultimate veteran\u201d and the ideal guy to have on a young team. \u201cHe was always constantly teaching us,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the league a long time, been on a lot of winning teams, and whenever he saw something, even if it was the smallest thing, whenever he saw something that wasn\u2019t right or something that we weren\u2019t doing right all the way, he would take the time, even stop practice, and just talk and tell us the right way to do it and why.\u201d Until the trade can be finalized, Oubre and Rivers weren\u2019t at Wizards practice, and Ariza wasn\u2019t with the Suns. But Wall and Bradley Beal said they\u2019ve each texted with Ariza since word of the trade got out. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to add a guy like Trevor back \u2013 one of the best veterans and teammates I had in the past,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe know what he brings to the table, and it seems like he\u2019s excited to be here.\u201d To get Ariza, the Wizards gave up the 23-year-old Oubre, who they wouldn\u2019t part with in a potential trade for Jimmy Butler earlier this fall. Oubre was the 15th overall pick in 2015 and is averaging 12.9 points in his fourth NBA season. Rivers goes to Phoenix after Washington had just acquired the 26-year-old from the Los Angeles Clippers over the summer. Rivers was not aware of the details Friday night but believed he was departing, putting him and Oubre in an uncomfortable spot. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unreal in a way,\u201d Beal said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that a lot. I kind of feel for Kelly and Austin to be put in that trick bag in a way of not knowing. \u2026 I think they handled it well, like professionals. I think anybody else would have been a little more frustrated.\u201d Despite having three max-contract players in Wall, Beal and Otto Porter, the Wizards are off to a disappointing 11-18 start amid chemistry questions and have lost four in a row. They host LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. Memphis general manager Chris Wallace said Saturday he was very disappointed someone with either Washington or Phoenix or both teams leaked the trade while the Grizzlies were playing Miami on Friday night. Wallace made it very clear that Dillon Brooks, in his second season since the 45th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft was traded to the Grizzlies, was never part of any discussions for this deal, and the team thought it was trading MarShon Brooks. Wallace said the leaks forced him to do something for the first time in more than 30 years of working in the NBA: pulling MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden Jr. out of a locker room to tell them they had been traded only to have to backtrack and say they hadn\u2019t been traded. \u201cWhat happened last night was unfathomable,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced this before. And we were very clear about who was in this deal, and Dillon Brooks never was intended to be a part of this, was not from our standpoint and we made it very clear this was not Dillon Brooks.\u201d MarShon Brooks said Wallace told him he had been traded after the game in front of the team. He showered, went to the family room and was starting to walk out when Wallace told him they needed to talk \u2013 a span of about 15 minutes. \u201cI was like, \u2018Huh?'\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI was confused, man.

The move, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , was made official by the team on Monday morning. Per Wojnarowski, Krauskopf will work with the Pacers\u2019 current basketball operations staff, which includes President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard, general manager Chad Buchanan and assistant GM Peter Dinwiddie. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski: Krauskopf spent the last 19 seasons as the Indiana Fever\u2019s top executive and oversaw the Pacers NBA2k league team in the last year. She will relinquish those duties when she starts her new position on January 1, 2019. The Fever and Pacers Gaming will report directly to Pacers Sports & Entertainment President\/Chief Operating Officer Rick Fuson while the organization evaluates and identifies new leadership. \u201cFirst, I would like to thank Herb Simon, Kevin Pritchard and Rick Fuson for this amazing opportunity,\u201d Krauskopf said in a news release Monday. \u201cI have admired the work that Kevin and his staff have put forth so far and I am honored to be a part of an elite and historical franchise. The chance to work in an NBA front office for a first-class organization filled with great people I know and in a city that has become my home is extraordinary. \u201cMy past experience has shown me that building winning teams and elite level culture is not based on gender \u2013 it is based on people and processes. I am excited to join the Pacers as we continue building the best NBA franchise in the business.\u201d Krauskopf had a significant role with USA Basketball\u2019s women\u2019s national team, playing a part in the selection process of three gold-medal winning squads (2004, 2008 and 2012). Several other teams in the NBA have women in front office basketball roles, including the Orlando Magic (Becky Bonner), Oklahoma City Thunder (Amanda Green), Toronto Raptors (Teresa Resch), Atlanta Hawks (Michelle Leftwich), Houston Rockets (Ariana Andonian) and Brooklyn Nets (Natalie Jay). Additionally, the Denver Nuggets hired WNBA legend Sue Bird to their front office in November as a basketball operations associate . In the WNBA, Krauskopf was the longest-tenured senior team executive in the league, dating beyond the Fever to her time as the league\u2019s first Director of Basketball Operations in 1996. She joined the Pacers Sports & Entertainment group in 1999, building rosters that led the Pacers to the playoffs 13 times including three WNBA Finals appearances and a WNBA championship in 2012. A 1983 graduate of Texas A&M University, Krauskopf was a three-year letterwinner in basketball for the Lady Aggies. \u201cAs the architect of one of the WNBA\u2019s most successful franchises, Kelly is a true pioneer in our sport,\u201d Simon said in a statement Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Kelly over the past two decades, so I know her tremendous basketball mind, strong work ethic and proven leadership skills will continue to be of great benefit to our organization.\u201d \u201cKelly has played the game, worked in the WNBA league office, helped build and run the Fever franchise from its beginning and eventually built a championship team,\u201d Pritchard said in a statement Monday. \u201cShe is very well respected in all basketball circles and she has great knowledge of our entire operation, so when we looked at this position, it made complete sense to just look in our own building.

Conley\u2019s Grizzlies have been one of the biggest surprises during an early season full of them around the NBA. That\u2019s why two other words are perhaps more appropriate descriptors for the veteran point guard. The words \u201call\u201d and \u201cstar\u201d carry a certain cachet when they are hyphenated and accompany the name of a NBA player. Conley has been on the cusp of All-Star status before, but has never reached that level for whatever reason. This could (and should) be the season that changes. The Grizzlies are thriving with their new-look \u201cGrit-and-Grind\u201d routine, and it\u2019s due in large part to the work of their gritty and underrated point guard.

The Grizzlies are in Oakland tonight for a dinner date ( 10:30 ET, NBA TV ) with the reigning two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors, who boast one of the finest point guards in NBA history (Stephen Curry). Conley\u2019s up for the challenge, averaging 20.4 points and 6.5 assists per game in 29 games one season after being limited to just 12 games due to a heel injury . The Grizzlies are as well, with a Southwest Division-leading 16-13 record compiled in the face of the sort of drama ( see last week\u2019s trade craziness ) that would sack most teams. But not with Conley, Marc Gasol and Garrett Temple leading the way. Conley spoke with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith about becoming a true \u201cMemphian,\u201d the Grizzlies\u2019 \u201cGrit-and-Grind\u201d reboot and much more. * * * Sekou Smith:  You guys have shocked a lot of people this season, playing the way you have. What\u2019s shocked you about the start you all have had to this season? Mike Conley:  I think the thing that\u2019s shocked me is how good defensively we\u2019ve become and how much further we can go, I think. I knew we\u2019d be good defensively. But I didn\u2019t think \u2026 we have so many guys that I didn\u2019t know defended as well as they did, like Kyle Anderson is a great defender. Garrett Temple is a great defender, Shelvin Mack, everybody that we added this offseason really fit the mold and has taken our team back into that one of the best defensive teams in the league conversation, as we go forward. SS:  It\u2019s so tough to go from where you were during the \u201cGrit-and-Grind\u201d era to reconstitute yourself with a different coach and different players and step right back into that profile. How strange has it been to see your team morph from one thing just a few months ago back into \u201cGrit-and-Grind\u201d mode? MC:  Yeah, it\u2019s an adjustment. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s not necessarily popular in today\u2019s league, with the game and the way it\u2019s being played. I told the guys jokingly before the season, \u201cAre y\u2019all sure you want to play this way?\u201d It requires a lot, you know. You\u2019ve got to be in great shape to defend the way we do and then still be effective on the other end. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard work. So I think it hit everybody hard early in the season. Luckily, we got off to a good start and we started to see the results of what our defense can do and what it means to the game. And people buy-in. With all that going on, it\u2019s easy for me and Marc to just bring it back to that stage where we were three or four years ago when we were doing the same thing: Be the best defensive team in the league night in and night out. SS:  You\u2019re wearing a completely different hat now compared to then. You\u2019re being asked to score much more and looking at the value the game places on point guards who can score, distribute and defend, guys that can do it all, I\u2019m thinking Mike Conley has to make the All-Star team this year. MC:  Right, right, I know where you are going (laughing). SS:  That said, I know you always preach team first. You\u2019ve been that way since Lawrence North (High School in Indianapolis, where Conley teamed with former No. 1 overall pick Greg Oden to win multiple state championships) to Ohio State (where he and Oden led the Buckeyes to the NCAA title game as freshmen) to your time with the Grizzlies. So how do you reconcile your desire to see this team reach its full potential with the underlying pursuit of making that All-Star team for the first time? MC:  It\u2019s always been, especially here in Memphis, more about our team and if we can win and be effective and put our team on the map, our individual things will follow. For me, I just seem to be the Lone Ranger in the fact that even though we\u2019re winning, everybody around me seems to have gotten that notice or that kind of attention and I have yet to kind of crack through to that All-Star bid. It\u2019s not changed the way I feel about the game and my approach to the game is always team first. I hope with me coming back this season and playing the way I have and my team playing the way we have that it will turn a few heads, or at least a few more heads, and hopefully I\u2019ll get that opportunity this year to experience All-Star Weekend on that stage. SS:  When you bounce back the way you have this season, I\u2019d imagine it makes it extremely tough to look back at the 2017-18 season the Grizzlies endured and see things go off track the way they did, knowing you couldn\u2019t do anything about it on the court? MC:  It was hard just to watch your brothers fight every night and scratch and claw for everything they could get out of every game and just not have enough to win games. And knowing that you and your absence was a big reason why things were unraveling the way they did. It was hard to watch. It was hard to be away from the team, obviously when I had surgery, and for weeks at a time as you are trying to heal up and get right. Obviously, it was hard thinking about the future at that time, you know, what direction are we going? I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s so much uncertainty and doubt at a time like that because of how the season played out, you just didn\u2019t know what was going to happen going forward. It was just a weird season honestly, but ultimately it seems to have worked itself out. SS:  I know you guys had a preexisting relationship with J.B. [Bickerstaff] before he assumed the duties as coach and then took over that job on a permanent basis, but what is different about him than perhaps what you initially realized? What\u2019s been the marked difference in him as a head coach and what has he done to connect with this team that wasn\u2019t done before? MC:  I think everybody loved J.B. before he was our permanent head coach because he\u2019s so honest with everybody. He\u2019s so up front with you. He tells you how he feels and what he needs out of each individual guy. And guys really respect that about him. Guys also respect the fact that knows he doesn\u2019t really know it all and he\u2019s willing to admit that. He doesn\u2019t always approach each situation claiming he has the answer. He\u2019s willing to listen. He\u2019s willing to adjust, you know, he\u2019s that kind of guy. And us vets on the team, we really took to him really easily because of that, he allows the space for guys to lead. And the young guys really have soaked up everything that he\u2019s tried to establish in terms of a foundation and culture for the team and organization and how we\u2019re going to operate, especially on the defensive side of the ball and getting that mentality back that we\u2019d have over the years. SS:  You\u2019ve been in Memphis long enough to know just how passionate and how attached that city becomes to its basketball stars. Do you feel fully engrossed in that culture now after all this time living and experiencing it, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows and everything in between? MC:  Oh yeah man, I know what this game means to the people of Memphis, to this region. And yeah, I\u2019m a Memphian. Thankfully, I\u2019ve been able to play my whole career here and to see the growth and the fans have been there behind us since the beginning. And I think more so than anything, they feel a connection to our players, the guys we bring in, because of the style, the mind set and the blue-collar grind and attitude we all bring to the game every single day and seem to embody. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s very much similar to the way Memphis is made up. The people of Memphis go about their business every day with that blue-collar attitude. They work hard, work their tails off, they never complain and you have plenty of things to complain about but you don\u2019t hear it. And in that way the Grizzlies are the same way. We come in and do our jobs and don\u2019t try to get caught up in anything else but our work and getting the job done. I think that\u2019s what they love the most about us and what we love and respect the most about them. It\u2019s that Memphis pride.  SS:  You mentioned spending your whole career in Memphis. Do you every stop and think about where you were when you first came into the league and where you are now, and just quickly it seems it\u2019s all gone down? MC:  Oh man [laughing], definitely. I\u2019ve sat there multiple times the past couple of years and said to myself, \u2018What happened?\u2019 or better yet \u2018How did this happen?\u2019 because it\u2019s hard to wrap your head around how I\u2019m in this position now, when I\u2019m looking around the locker room and looking for an older guy or somebody I can ask a question to and there\u2019s, literally nobody there like that. And it\u2019s because myself, Marc and Garrett Temple, we\u2019re the guys that all the younger players are looking up to and looking at to figure all of this stuff out. It really is strange how quickly it happened. I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019ve been able to play as long as I have, but man these [12] years have gone by so fast. SS:  You, perhaps better than most, can look back over the years at all of the guys whose paths you\u2019ve crossed in basketball and can appreciate how hard it is to do this at a high level for so long. Does that also remind you of the importance for guys such as yourself, true veterans, how important it is to come back year after year with a new piece added to your game if you want to stay relevant and to keep climbing? MC:  Yeah, it\u2019s a constant battle each summer, especially with the way the game changed over the last few years. When I first came into the league there was getting in shape and all these things you have going on, and I\u2019m younger so I\u2019m able to do all of those things. Then you get a little older and you have to work double time to do those same things you used to do much easier. Now I feel like you have to work triple time to be in the NBA shape of today, the way people move up and down the floor is a lot faster and guys are playing a lot quicker and everybody is handling the ball, so it just became like the older you get the more and more you have to put into your game to stay afloat and to keep up with all these young guys. I mean, I\u2019ve got a rookie in Jaren [Jackson Jr.] who personifies exactly what I\u2019m talking about. He comes in here as a teenager, right around 7-feet tall with all the length and bounce you want in a young guy and he\u2019s shooting 3-pointers and blocking shots and playing all over the floor and doing a little bit of everything. That\u2019s where we are right now in this league and I\u2019d be lying if I told you that the future doesn\u2019t get me going. This is a fascinating time to be in this position in this league because the future is so bright, here in Memphis and throughout the league. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

That\u2019s the trait Boston displayed against New Orleans on Monday, as both Al Horford and Kyrie Irving watched Marcus Morris and Co. rack up the team\u2019s sixth straight win. Morris finished with a season-high 31 points and youngster Jayson Tatum added 21, too, in the win. Lakers 108, Heat 105 \u2014 The Dwyane Wade farewell tour took on special significance on Monday, what with the former Finals MVP paying his last visit to his former teammate, LeBron James. Fittingly, Wade had a shot to send the game into overtime at the buzzer, but his 27 footer fell short (thanks to some fantastic defense by James). The story for this one is less the final score and more the moment of two legends squaring off one last time in an iconic NBA venue. Pacers 113, Bucks 97 \u2014 Chalk up another win against an Eastern Conference favorite for Indiana, which had beaten Boston earlier this season as well. The return of Victor Oladipo sparked the Pacers to their fifth straight win and has them in the thick of the East chase with the Celtics, Raptors and Sixers. Celtics 130, Wizards 125 (OT) \u2014 It\u2019s something for a player to get \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants in his home arena. It\u2019s quite another to get them on the road after destroying that foe with back-to-back clutch shots. Irving put on a show in the extra period, but John Wall and Bradley Beal kept the Wizards in this one as much as they could. In short, it was a showdown between star guards you had to see. Rockets 126, Lakers 111 \u2014 Some players are fortunate enough to score 50 points in a game. Others are good enough to rack up triple-doubles regularly. Then, there was James Harden on Thursday night \u2026 he did both. Harden notched the fourth 50-point triple-double of his career, and only the 13th in NBA history , in powering the Rockets to key win. Trail Blazers 128, Raptors 122 \u2014 From the start of the season until Thanksgiving, Portland was a pleasant surprise with its 12-6 start . Things have gone a downhill since then and the Blazers were 15-13 entering Friday\u2019s showdown with the East-leading Raptors. This one featured a great showdown of two clutch scorers (Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard and Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard), but was decided by Portland\u2019s reserves late. Lakers 128, Hornets 100 \u2014 What could possibly make a 28-point win a game worth noting in this space? Nothing \u2026 except for two teammates \u2014 LeBron James and Lonzo Ball \u2014 each logging a triple-double in the Lakers\u2019 win. They became the eighth set of teammates in NBA history to earn triple-doubles in the same game. Nuggets 95, Raptors 86 \u2014 Roughly two weeks since winning a thriller in Toronto, the Nuggets completed the season-series sweep with a great comeback at home on Sunday. Nikola Jokic did most of the heavy lifting all game, but a timely scoring surge from Jamal Murray powered Denver to a win in a showdown of the top-seeded teams in the East and West. LeBron James (24 points, 7-15 FG, 12 reb, 11 ast in 30 minutes) & Lonzo Ball (16 points, 7-11 FG, 10 reb, 10 ast, 5 stl in 34 minutes) \u2014 Few in Lakers lore are more beloved than Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James and Ball have a ways to go to reach that lofty air, but for one night, they had something in common with the \u201cShowtime\u201d duo. In notching a triple-double on Saturday vs. Charlotte, they became the first Lakers teammates to accomplish the feat since Jan. 22, 1982 (when Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar did it). James Harden (50 points, 14-26 FG, 18-19 FT, 10 reb, 11 ast, 2 stl in 35 minutes) \u2014 It took some clutch scoring from the reigning Kia MVP to get this milestone game. Harden crossed into the 50-point realm in the final five minutes, scoring 11 points in that span (while also snaring rebound No. 10 with 90 seconds to go) to give Houston a critical victory. Kyrie Irving (38 points, 12-28 FG, 7 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 Some minor injuries have slowed the Celtics\u2019 star guard at times this season. The Wizards saw firsthand, though, that Irving is still as cold-blooded as ever. He netted 12 of his points in OT, including a pair of dagger 3-pointers that sealed a closer-than-it-should-have-been win for Boston. | Watch | Video box score Anthony Davis (41 points, 17-34 FG, 7 reb, 4 stl in 38 minutes) \u2014 Although this performance came in a loss to the Boston Celtics on Monday, it also proved why Davis is a go-to player. He was hot in the fourth quarter as the Pelicans tried to comeback, but ultimately fell short of that thanks to Marcus Morris. | Watch | Video box score Stephen Curry (38 points, 12-23 FG, 7-14 3pt FG, 7 reb 6 ast, 2 stl in 36 minutes) \u2014 After a pedestrian first half on Monday against the Wolves (5-12 FG, 13 points), Curry went 7-for-11 in the second half to fuel an overall efficient scoring night. His pair of deep shots in the fourth quarter sealed the win and upped his scoring average to 31.4 ppg since returning from injury. | Watch | Video box score Dwyane Wade (15 points, 6-19 FG, 5 reb, 10 ast in 32 minutes) \u2014 Yes, the space here is often reserved for amazing stat lines and performances. But how can we overlook the effort Wade put in to try and get a win over his good buddy LeBron? While James dazzled in his own right (28 points, 9 rebounds, 12 assists), Wade showed some familiar flair in this near-win for the Heat. | Watch | Video box score Kyle Lowry (21 points, 8-13 FG, 5 reb, 7 ast in 32 minutes) \u2014 It had been a rough stretch for Lowry, who was shooting 4-for-28 in his previous four games before facing the LA Clippers on Tuesday. Not only did Toronto score a big win against another West contender, but the stat line Lowry delivered was more in tune with his usual performance. | Watch | Video box score Spencer Dinwiddie (39 points, 11-18 FG, 5 ast in 30 minutes) \u2014 Close games hadn\u2019t been kind to Brooklyn entering Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the Philadelphia 76ers (the Nets were 4-5 in games decided by three points or less). Dinwiddie showed the scoring form that made him a standout last season, doing all his damage in a reserve roll to power another win this season vs. Philly. | Watch | Video box score \u201cWe seem to make every guard look like a freakin\u2019 Hall of Famer.\u201d \u2014 Sixers center Joel Embiid , after Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie scored 39 \u201cHe\u2019s good at basketball. Nothing he does surprises me. Even on a night he gets off to a slow start he finds a way.\u201d \u2014 Warriors coach Steve Kerr , on Stephen Curry \u201cSome people say you shouldn\u2019t be friends with your competitors.

He knows my moves just like I know his moves. I just wanted to enjoy the competition for the last time.\u201d \u2014 Heat guard Dwyane Wade , on LeBron James \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, man. I watched a lot of him (LeBron) growing up and now we had triple-doubles in the same game. I don\u2019t even know if I dreamed of that before.\u201d \u2014 Lakers guard Lonzo Ball \u201cAny time you can put yourself in the conversation of Laker history, all the guys that have come through this franchise, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d \u2014 Lakers forward LeBron James , on he and Ball notching triple-doubles in the same game \u201cIt\u2019s a little awkward, you know. I\u2019m a human. I\u2019ve got feelings. I\u2019m not just numb to the situation. I don\u2019t know how it happened.

It\u2019s been going on all year. I do not understand why they are letting everybody play one of the best players in the league so physically. I do not understand.\u201d \u2014 Raptors coach Nick Nurse , about the lack of foul calls for Kawhi Leonard on Sunday vs. Denver We\u2019re all busy.

The Raptors, Bucks and 76ers are all meeting or exceeding high expectations at this early juncture, and the Celtics, presumptive favorites to succeed the LeBron-less Cavs as beasts of the East, finally looked the part with an eight-game win streak that ended on Saturday. Yet the hottest team among them is the Pacers. They finished strong against the Knicks on Sunday for their seventh straight victory, the longest active streak in the NBA and their best since 2016-17. One of the biggest surprises of last season, Indiana is proving it was no fluke with 20 wins in 30 outings, tying them with Milwaukee for second in the East behind mighty Toronto. The Pacers\u2019 solid start comes with an asterisk: Per Basketball Reference, they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s fifth-easiest schedule so far. But that tidbit comes with several additional asterisks of its own: Not only do the Pacers boast the NBA\u2019s fifth-best point differential at 5.3 points per game, they won 7 of 11 outings without All-Star shooting guard Victor Oladipo as he dealt with a sore right knee. Oladipo returned last Wednesday, scoring a total of 26 points in double-digit victories over the Bucks and 76ers. But he was all the way back to his old self against the Knicks with 26 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and five steals as the Pacers closed on an extended 29-18 surge. As has been the case all season, the Pacers had plenty of other contributors. Myles Turner extended his recent run of impressive play with 24 points, Domantas Sabonis added his 12th double-double off the bench and the Pacers, who entered with the NBA\u2019s second-best defensive rating, collectively held the Knicks to 41.6-percent shooting. The continued development of their two standout bigs is encouraging, particularly Turner. While he wasn\u2019t exactly bad, neither did Turner do much early on to prove he was deserving of the lucrative extension he signed during the offseason. Since Nov. 26, however, he\u2019s been borderline great, averaging 15.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.9 blocks as the Pacers have gone 9-2. The Pacers still might not have the raw star or staying power of their fellow Eastern leaders. But with Oladipo, one of the league\u2019s best young frontcourt tandems and a deep rotation that goes eight or nine deep, they continue to prove that life after Paul George can be pretty, pretty good. Let\u2019s be completely honest. There\u2019s no way any game not involving the two-time defending champion Warriors can be a real Finals preview. So let\u2019s just call Sunday\u2019s battle between the Raptors and Nuggets in Denver what it was: A really entertaining game between the first-place teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences. The proceedings were unfortunately marred by a glut of absences as both teams were forced to play without three of their top five scorers. (Curse you, Injury Bug!) But while that impacted the quality of play \u2014 the two foes combined to shoot 41 percent \u2014 it did nothing to diminish the drama. The two teams battled through 13 lead changes in the first half before the Raptors, riding a monster 16-0 run overlapping halftime, surged ahead by as many as 13 in the third quarter. Then the Nuggets responded with an uppercut of their own, ripping off 18 unanswered to take the lead for good despite a sweat-inducing late push by the Raptors. Despite yeoman\u2019s work from Kawhi Leonard (29 points, 14 rebounds, four assists), the difference proved to be the Nuggets\u2019 tandem of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. While Jokic did the heavy lifting with 26 points, nine rebounds and four assists, Murray scored 15 of his 19 points in the fourth to carry the Nuggets home for a 95-86 triumph .  While you cleaned out your garage or did the weekly grocery shopping, John Wall spent his Sunday tormenting the Lakers with brilliance like this: By the time the dust settled, Wall had amassed one of the most awesome stat lines of his career (40 points, 14 assists, six rebounds, three steals and two blocks) and the Wizards were 128-110 victors over their hapless guests. It was a far cry from his listless performance against the Nets on Friday, in which he scored a paltry 17 points on 16 shots. \u201cJust being aggressive, just trying to get downhill and attack the basket,\u201d said Wall, as reported by the The Washington Post . \u201cKind of disappointed how I played in Brooklyn. Not being aggressive. When I\u2019m aggressive, it makes it easier for guys offensively.\u201d Not to be done, giant-sized point guard Ben Simmons turned in one of the best games of his young career as the 76ers pasted the Cavaliers 128-105. His 22 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists were impressive enough. But what really set his performance apart was the fact he committed no turnovers to become the first player to hit those numbers since Antoine Walker in 2002 and, at 22, the youngest to do it since Grant Hill in 1995. Not enough esoteric stats for you? Try this one: Simmons also became the second-fastest to reach 15 career triple-doubles at 111 games, surpassing Magic Johnson\u2019s 116. (The record: 40, held by the ridiculous Oscar Robertson.) The Nets absorbed one of the biggest body blows of the young season on Nov. 12 when popular and productive shooting guard Caris LeVert dislocated his right foot. (Although the injury was actually less severe than initially thought, there is still no timetable for his return.) They promptly dropped 10 of their next 12, and whatever hopes of earning their first playoff berth since 2014-15 seemed all but dashed. Make no mistake: That\u2019s still going to be a tall task. But the Nets have at least showed some major heart lately with five straight victories, including Sunday\u2019s 144-127 rout of the Hawks. In the Good Omen Department, that\u2019s the longest winning streak the Nets have enjoyed since that 2014-15 campaign. No wonder Jarrett Allen\u2019s excited. Count Kings coach Dave Joerger among Luka Doncic\u2019s many fans after he lavished praise on the early Kia Rookie of the Year favorite prior to Sunday\u2019s contest in Dallas. While it wasn\u2019t enough to avert a 120-113 loss for the Mavericks, Doncic turned in yet another quality performance with 28 points, six rebounds and nine assists. As good as Doncic already is, he\u2019s got a mountain to climb if he wants to threaten Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s status as the greatest player in franchise history. The Mavs and their faithful showed their appreciation for the big German with a tribute video and standing ovation as he made the 21st home season debut of his illustrious career.

The title has a nice ring to it. Sue Bird, point guard for the Seattle Storm. Now that\u2019s a title she\u2019s not quite ready to give up. Bird has spent the last month with the Nuggets, hitting the road to help out with some scouting. The 38-year-old is receiving a first-class education in another side of the game and it gives her something to ponder down the road. That is, when she\u2019s shot her last jumper. The basketball fire still burns after wrapping up her 16th WNBA season with a championship in September. \u201cI\u2019m a player. I\u2019m still focused on my playing career. I want to get the most out of that as possible,\u201d Bird said Sunday night before the Nuggets hosted Toronto. \u201cWhether I retire tomorrow or in 20 years, I just want to get as much out as I can. But with that I have an understanding that basketball\u2019s not forever. At some point you\u2019ve got to find something else, find your way, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about this. Hopefully with this process I can find out if I\u2019m any good at this, if this is for me, and see what happens.\u201d Bird was brought on board through a conversation with Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly. He basically asked: What does she want to do when she\u2019s done? \u201cI always thought front office work, being with the team day in and day out, that was something I wasn\u2019t going to get to until I was done,\u201d Bird said. \u201cWhen he put it in a way I could do both it became extremely attractive.\u201d Admittedly, the learning curve has been steep. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of players. It\u2019s a lot of teams,\u201d said Bird, who\u2019s helped the Storm to three titles. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history that I\u2019m stepping into now and having to learn about. The one thing you learn is when you can step out your comfort zone and be uncomfortable you see what you\u2019re made of and who you are.\u201d Bird\u2019s quickly gotten up to speed in her role as a scout. Then again, the Nuggets expected nothing less as they\u2019re off to a sizzling start. \u201cShe\u2019s been an asset,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cAnybody who has a resume Sue has is going to help any organization.\u201d A native of New York, Bird played for Connecticut and helped the Huskies to two NCAA championships. She was taken by Seattle with the No. 1 pick in the 2002 WNBA draft. Since then, she\u2019s become one of the league\u2019s most decorated players. And now, she\u2019s becoming part of a growing community of women in the NBA. Kristi Toliver was added to Washington\u2019s staff of assistant coaches, and Chasity Melvin became an assistant coach with Charlotte\u2019s G League affiliate in Greensboro, North Carolina. There are also trailblazers such as San Antonio assistant Becky Hammon, former Sacramento assistant Nancy Lieberman, Dallas assistant Jenny Boucek, Clippers G League assistant Natalie Nakase and Memphis analyst Nicki Gross. \u201cThere\u2019s something nice about being part of a trailblazing group,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to look at myself that way because I look at Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoops and Rebecca Lobo and Dawn Staley in that way. \u2026 I know in 20 years I\u2019ll be looked at as part of that group I just named.\u201d"},{"id":36872,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sixers-jimmy-butler-returns-groin-injury","date":"2018-12-16","title":"Sixers\u2019 Butler returns from strained groin against Cavs","content":"CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler returned for the Philadelphia 76ers against the Cleveland Cavaliers after missing two games because of a strained groin.

The Grizzlies, Suns and Wizards had a deal in place that would have sent swingman Trevor Ariza to Washington, Kelly Oubre to Memphis and Austin Rivers to Phoenix. When reports differed as to whether the Suns were acquiring Dillon or MarShon Brooks from Memphis, however, the deal fell apart. Phoenix insisted on Dillon Brooks, while Memphis maintained it had intended to deal MarShon Brooks all along.

The Grizzlies believed they were trading MarShon Brooks, while the Suns thought they were acquiring Dillon Brooks, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Wojnarowski explains the confusion stemmed from the fact that Grizzlies and Suns did not communicate directly on the trade, using the Wizards as a conduit in coordinating the three-team deal. The widely reported trade ultimately fell through once it was apparent the two teams were talking about two different players. Dillon Brooks offered a funny response to the trade that never was. During the Warriors\u2019 pregame introductions, a video appeared on the Golden 1 Center big screen of the first manned moon landing. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Stephen Curry, who sent social media into a tizzy earlier this week when he jokingly suggested on a podcast that the moon landing was faked. As you can see, Curry appreciated the Kings\u2019 next-level trolling. As usual, Curry got the last laugh, scoring 35 points as the Warriors rallied in crunch time for a 130-125 victory. The Indiana Pacers overcame a monster first half from Joel Embiid to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 113-101 in a matchup of Eastern Conference contenders. With Jimmy Butler out with a strained groin, Embiid was the 76ers\u2019 offense, scoring 28 points and 14 rebounds in the first half. By comparison, the Pacers\u2019 starters had 25 points and 11 rebounds at the break. Embiid finished with 40 points and 21 rebounds, becoming the first Sixers player with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds in a game since Charles Barkley on Dec. 7, 1990. Meanwhile, former Sixer Thaddeus Young scored a season-high 26 points as the Pacers extended their winning streak to six games. Since Feb. 1, 2018, the Sixers are 32-4 at home \u2014 including their 0-2 record against the Pacers. In the final seconds of the Nuggets\u2019 109-98 testy win over the Thunder, Russell Westbrook and Jamal Murray pushed each other and argued after lining up next to each other for a jump ball. Nikola Jokic tried to get between them, and Westbrook threatened to beat up Jokic while being restrained. No blows were exchanged, but Westbrook and Murray were each assessed technical fouls. Asked what led to the altercation with Murray, Westbrook said, \u201c He was in my way .\u201d Hornets legend Muggsy Bogues started to tear up during a halftime ceremony where he was honored for his contribution to Charlotte basketball. The 5-foot-3 Bogues, drafted by the Hornets in 1988, played for the organization for 10 years. It\u2019s easy to see why Matthew Dellavedova is a fan favorite in Cleveland. Dellavedova, reacquired last week from Milwaukee, dove into the scorers table saving a ball that was headed out of bounds in the second quarter and crashed into Fred McLeod, the Cavaliers\u2019 television play-by-play man. The collision sent both to the floor. Dellavedova climbed over the table and returned to action. McLeod was helped up and continued to call the game.

LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: ATHO Latest stats: 7 games, 29.1 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 7.7 apg Season stats: 28.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 7.0 apg It was just another dominant two-week stretch for James, who has completely spoiled us with his impressive performances night after night. His last seven are no exception, putting up 20 or more in all seven while going over 30 twice. Heck, he even managed to nail three or more 3-pointers in four of the seven. _______________________________________________________________ 1. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 8 games, 20.6 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.1 apg Season stats: 18.5 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 2.1 apg Shooting a blistering 58.6 from the field while chipping in 20 or more points in five of eight games propels Aldridge to the top. What makes that more impressive is the fact that he\u2019s gone over 30 minutes in just three of those games. Of course, we\u2019d like to see more work on the boards since his last double-digit rebound game was Nov. 23. 2. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 7 games, 10.4 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 4.3 apg Season stats: 16.4 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 4.0 apg After a dominant stretch over the last three weeks of November, Gasol\u2019s production has slipped considerably. In his last seven games, he\u2019s gone for 10 or more points just four times, with none of those being more than 15. Also over those seven, Gasol has just one double-double while shooting 34.6 percent from the field. 3. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 6 games, 17.5 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 18.2 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 3.0 apg Consistency has always been the calling card of Redick, who scored between 11-25 points in all six games and has now scored in double figures in all 29 games this season. But his touch from deep has been hit and miss, hitting 8-for-18 over two games only to follow with 5-for-24 over the next three. 4. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 6 games, 9.8 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 8.7 apg Season stats: 14.2 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 10.0 apg We were ready to drop Lowry down a couple spots since his first four games produced 15 total points on 14.2 FG% (4-for-28) and just 3-for-25 from deep. Then he seemed to find his touch, going for 22.0 points on 54.8 FG% (17-for-31) and 6-for-15 on 3s in the last two games. Yep, strong enough to flip the script and move up. 5. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 5 games, 15.6 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 5.6 apg Season stats: 17.2 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 4.5 apg Before missing the last two games with a hamstring injury that could sideline him for two weeks, Williams was doing his thing, going for 18 or more in three of the five in just 23.0 minutes. He also chipped in five or more assists in four of those games. Unfortunately, with him being on the shelf for some time, he\u2019ll be slipping down a bit. 6. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 7 games, 13.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 8.9 apg Season stats: 16.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 8.0 apg It was a mixed bag of good and bad for Paul. The good was a 23-point, eight-assist showing against the Mavericks. The bad was a five-point effort on 1-for-8 shooting against the Wolves. In between there was a 12-13 effort against the Bulls, a triple-double on 2-for-12 shooting against the Blazers and a 14-10 against the Spurs. 7. Tony Parker (36), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 6 games, 13.5 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 4.5 apg Season stats: 10.5 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 4.3 apg If you toss out (we\u2019re trying hard to do that) a zero-point game against the Wolves last Wednesday, Parker was very solid while averaging just 21.7 minutes. For the first time since Nov. 1-3, the 17-year vet scored in double figures in consecutive games. In fact, he\u2019s scored at least 16 points in four of the last six games. 8. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: 10 Latest stats: 7 games, 13.1 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 5.4 apg Season stats: 14.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 3.9 apg Despite shooting just 32.6 FG% and 30.6 3PT%, Wade moves up. That\u2019s what happens when you score in double figures in five of the last seven, including a 25-point performance against the Clippers. A 15-10 against the Lakers wasn\u2019t too shabby, either, though it did take him 19 shots to get there. 9. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: 8 games, 15.6 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 14.1 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.2 apg Like Parker, Gay had an ugly zero-point performance that we\u2019ll try our best to brush aside. After all, he did manage to shoot 59.0 FG% and 52.4 3PT% over the last eight games. Unlike Parker, Gay also had two other ugly showings: nine points on Nov. 30 against the Rockets and 10 points against the Lakers last Friday. 10. J.J. Barea (34), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 7 games, 12.6 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.4 apg Season stats: 11.4 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 5.4 apg Barea put together a pair of solid efforts (24 points last Sunday against the Clippers and 18 points on Wednesday against the Hawks). And last Wednesday\u2019s game wasn\u2019t too shabby (14 points on 6-for-10 shooting). But in between was a bunch of blah \u2014 four games all under 10 points on a combined 13-for-37 (35.1%) shooting.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania of The Athletic originally reported that the Suns, Wizards and Grizzlies had agreed on a multi-team deal that would send Ariza to Washington, Austin Rivers to Phoenix and Kelly Oubre to Memphis. Later Friday evening, however, confusion mounted as to whether Phoenix would acquire MarShon Brooks or Dillon Brooks (both currently with the Grizzlies) as part of the deal. Dillon Brooks is a 22-year-old guard taken in the second round of the 2017 Draft. MarShon Brooks is 29-year-old swingman who has played just 66 NBA games since 2013-14. The former was apparently too valuable to trade, as Memphis reportedly killed the deal roughly one hour after it was originally reported as all but complete. The uncertainty surrounding this particular detail ultimately unraveled the trade as Memphis and Phoenix could not agree on which Brooks would be dealt to the Suns. Ariza previously played in Washington for two seasons (2012-14), and it was there he blossomed as a 3-point shooting specialist. The former second-round pick teamed up with John Wall and Bradley Beal to help the Wizards advance to Game 6 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. After four years with Houston, Ariza signed a one-year deal with the young Suns during the 2018 offseason. Phoenix, however, is dead-last in the West at 5-24 and in need of a point guard to play alongside Devin Booker. The Suns are a bottom-five team on both offense and defense while alternating between rookie point guards Elie Okobo and De\u2019Anthony Melton. Memphis, meanwhile, failed to acquire a versatile swingman at least for the time being.

Harden\u2019s winning Kia MVP campaign of a year ago was bolstered by the Rockets\u2019 season-long assault on the league, a grind that netted them the best record in franchise history and the league, and that coveted home court advantage throughout the playoffs. Just making the playoffs this season is going to take some serious work this time around. The Rockets are still digging out of an early-season tailspin that threatened to destroy what they\u2019ve built with Harden and Chris Paul leading the way. But if Harden has more of what we saw from him in Thursday night\u2019s showcase performance against LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers at Toyota Center, both the playoffs and a legitimate run at a second straight MVP are not out of the realm of possibility. Harden stroked the Lakers for 50 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds, the fourth 50-point triple-double of his career. He joins a hallowed short list of Hall of Famers (Elgin Baylor twice, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Richie Guerin) to accomplish that feat. The Lakers got a triple-dose of Harden\u2019s best, as he closed the show by scoring 11 points in the final five minutes. He didn\u2019t shoot well from beyond the 3-point line (4-for-12) but collected his makes when it mattered post, including a late dagger over LeBron. He also knocked down 18 of his 19 free throw attempts, doing his usual from the foul line. More important, though, is Harden\u2019s acknowledgement of the dire straights the Rockets are in right now in the Western Conference playoff chase. They are still chasing the .500 line, and obviously have work to do. But that \u201chole\u201d they are in \u2026 things can change quickly with more big nights \u2014 and wins \u2014 from the reigning Kia MVP, who shoves his way back into the mix on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder for the first time in weeks. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week: No. 1 Season stats:  28.4 point, 7.6 rebounds, 7.0 assists, 1.4 steals LeBron and the Lakers were upstaged in Houston Thursday night by an epic performance from James Harden and the Houston Rockets. As frustrated as James and the Lakers were with the way the games was officiated, the bottom line is the Lakers still need another piece to solidify their rotation (hence their reported interest in acquiring Trevor Ariza). LeBron\u2019s ability to lift the Lakers into their current position in the Western Conference standings continues to serve as his most compelling argument for inclusion at or near the very top of anyone\u2019s MVP list. He\u2019s averaging 30.8 points (on .551 shooting, .419 from beyond the 3-point line), 8.4 assists, 7.0 rebounds and 1.8 steals over the Lakers\u2019 past five games. There isn\u2019t much more Lakers coach Luke Walton can squeeze out of his superstar anchor at this point of the season. If the Lakers want to maintain the pace in the playoff chase, the final two games of their current road trip (Charlotte Saturday and Washington Sunday) will require everything LeBron can muster. Last week: No. 3 Season stats:  26.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.9 steals Leonard has missed the Raptors\u2019 last two games with a bruised hip and is listed as questionable for tonight\u2019s game in Portland . The Raptors have been so good without Leonard this season (6-1), regardless of the opponent, that it\u2019s easy to poke holes in any MVP argument for him. Back-to-back road wins over the Clippers and Golden State Warriors without your best player does and should make the rest of the league pay attention to just how dangerous these Raptors are this season. But that\u2019s a shortsighted view of not only the impact Leonard has had on this team, as well as the appreciation for the continued growth and development of the deep roster the Raptors bring to the games night after night. Leonard\u2019s value to the Raptors\u2019 regular season grind will pale in comparison to what they\u2019ll ask of him in mid-April and beyond. Masai Ujiri could have maintained the status quo if it was just about owning the best record in the Eastern Conference over the that stretch. He\u2019s banking on a healthy Leonard being the difference, the closer the Raptors need to get to that next level in the postseason. Everything else appears to be in place. Last week: No. 2 Season stats:  28.9 points, 5.7 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.1 steals The hypothetical debates about who would win between Curry\u2019s Warriors and the Shaquille O\u2019Neal-Kobe Bryant-led three-peat Lakers teams is far more entertaining than anything else Curry and the Warriors had going on Wednesday night. He suffered through an ugly 10-point effort in a blowout home loss to the Toronto Raptors, who played without Kawhi Leonard, making just three of his 12 shots (2-for-8 from beyond the 3-point line). The Warriors had won four straight games prior to that thumping, with Curry averaging 32.5 points on .519 shooting from the floor and .456 from distance. That\u2019s the Curry the Warriors have to see in order to go on the tear that Steve Kerr said he felt was coming before the Raptors ran them off of their own floor at Oracle Arena. Tonight\u2019s short trip to Sacramento to face the Kings provides the first opportunity for Curry to get back on track. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  25.9 points, 13.1 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.3 blocks Antetokounmpo was a force (19 points, 19 rebounds, six assists and a block) in Sunday\u2019s impressive road win over the Toronto Raptors, a performance that followed his 22 points, 15 rebounds, five assists, two blocks and two steals in a home loss the Golden State Warriors. A last-minute scratch (sore neck) in Monday\u2019s win over Cleveland, Antetokounmpo couldn\u2019t shake loose from a well-well-crafted defensive scheme from the Indiana Pacers, finishing with 12 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. The Cavaliers will get the Greek Freak\u2019s best counterpunch tonight at Quicken Loans Arena. And they don\u2019t have the defensive framework the Pacers are working with under Nate McMillan. If you want to see Antetokounmpo at his best, just go back and watch him work against Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors. He was relentless in the face of the Raptors\u2019 defensive pressure and grinder his way to an all-important statement win for the Bucks. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.5 points, 13.3 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.9 blocks There is more focus these days on what Embiid says about the Sixers than what he does on a consistent basis for the Sixers. Don\u2019t let the big man\u2019s words get in the way of the fact that is indeed the most dominant low-post force in the game. Embiid was critical of his own game more after he failed to score 20 points in three straight games before he sat out in the Sixers\u2019 Dec. 7 win over Detroit, the game Brett Brown decided to rest him (drawing more chatter from Embiid, of course). But the response was what you\u2019d expect from a player who has spent most of this season dominating the competition on both ends of the floor. He scored 24 points, grabbed eight rebounds, dished out three assists and collected two blocks and two steals in Monday\u2019s win over the Pistons and Andre Drummond. And he was back in full MVP form in Wednesday\u2019s surprising home loss to Brooklyn, finishing with 33 points (on 12-for-18 shooting), 17 rebounds and six assists. Indiana\u2019s Myles Turner (tonight at Wells Fargo Center) is next up on Embiid\u2019s big man hit list. * * * The Next Five: 6. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7.

Then again, when you do what James Harden did to the Lakers on Thursday, you can wear pretty much whatever you want. Highlighted by a nasty poster slam over JaVale McGee and capped by a monster fourth quarter in which the Lakers were powerless to stop him, Harden carried the Rockets to a 126-111 victory almost by himself with 50 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. It was the fourth 50-point triple-double of his career, and only the 13th in NBA history . At one point the Lakers, frustrated by Harden\u2019s parade to the line for 19 free throws, reportedly held their arms behind their backs in protest for several defensive possessions. (News flash: That didn\u2019t work, either.) Perhaps the most impressive aspect of all was how little time Harden needed to amass those numbers, playing a relatively paltry 35 minutes to tie for the lightest workload among his 11 career 50-point games. Even so, Harden was still winded enough that he begged out of the game for a 4-minute, 30-second break midway through the fourth quarter as the outcome hung in the balance. He returned with 4:57 remaining, his team leading by five, and promptly proceeded to annihilate the Lakers with 15 of his team\u2019s final 17 points. The Rockets outscored the Lakers by 12 over that span, averting what would have been another demoralizing loss in a season that\u2019s already seen too many. \u201cYou look at the standings, we\u2019re in the 14th spot and that\u2019s kind of depressing,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to figure it out. I just believe and trust in all my guys, and the coaching staff. We\u2019ll continue to build.\u201d Good news, James! The win actually bumped the Rockets over the idle Timberwolves into 13th place, and thanks to the incredible congestion in the Western Conference, they\u2019re still only five games out of first place. Whether they can keep climbing remains to be seen. The only source of consistency has been their inconsistency, with their season breaking down into symmetrical chunks: 1-5, then 8-2, then 2-7, and now 2-0 following Thursday\u2019s win. But despite Chris Paul finally showing signs of slippage in his 14th season, and a noticeably thinner bench, the Rockets will always have hope that they can turn things around as long as No. 13\u2019s still suiting up. Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s days as a top-tier player have long since passed. His biggest contribution to the only NBA team he\u2019s ever played for no longer involves buckets, but mentoring the increasingly-worthy successor to his mantle as the face of the franchise, rookie Luka Doncic. (Fun fact: Doncic was born three weeks after the 40-year-old Nowitzki made his NBA debut in Feb. 1999.) But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t awesome to see the big German back on the court in Phoenix for the belated start to his 21st NBA season. True to old form, Nowtzki needed just 46 seconds to score his first bucket, a vintage one-leg fadeaway \u2014 off glass, no less! Nowitzki\u2019s debut made him the first player in NBA history to play 21 campaigns with one team. Indeed, only four other players have ever played that many seasons, period: Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, Kevin Garnett and the active Vince Carter. As planned, Nowitzki did not play in the second half, and finished with just those two points in six minutes. The Mavericks could have used some of their aging superstar\u2019s old magic as the lowly Suns beat them 99-89 to snap a 10-game losing streak. The latest stop in Nikola Vucevic\u2019s world \u201cMax Me Out\u201d tour took place in Mexico City, where the veteran center carried Orlando to a 97-91 victory over the Bulls with a bravura fourth. While not as singularly dominant as Harden, Vucevic was more than the Bulls could handle, piling up 10 points and five rebounds in the final period alone. Included in that outburst was his 15-foot jumper to put the Magic ahead for good with 28 seconds remaining. Vucevic finished with 26 points and 10 rebounds, and is now sitting at an impressive 20.8 and 11.8 for the season. If basketballs that get stuck between the rim and the backboard are wedgies , would this be a \u2026 ledgie?

No other NBA player has played that many seasons with the same team. \u201cIt is good to be back,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cObviously I got a lot of work to do timing-wise, conditioning-wise. I have been running on a treadmill, which is not the same as playing NBA speed against a bunch of 20-year-old athletes.\u201d The 40-year-old had been tied at 20 seasons with Kobe Bryant, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers after the 2015-16 season. Nowitzki had surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle last April, and the timing was to make sure he would be ready at the start of this season. But the 7-foot German had a setback before training camp, with tendon soreness forcing him to continue rehabbing the injury and missing the first 26 games. He made his first appearance in the lineup this season with 3:27 left in the opening quarter. A minute later, he banked in his first shot in his six-minute stint on the court. It was his only basket in his six minutes of play. \u201cAll things considered he did fine, did well,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cThis is a challenging situation for Dirk. Coming back in and re-accumulate mid-stream, with no real live practice time to speak of, but he has been busting his butt big time. I respect the hell out of him for what he has done to get back on the floor.\u201d The 2007 MVP said the slow pace of the rehab was to ensure Nowitzki wouldn\u2019t be sidelined again once he returns. The 13-time All-Star has been steadily ramping up his activity for several weeks. Nowitzki, who led the Mavericks to their only championship as the NBA Finals MVP in 2011, took pride in playing 77 games last season as a 39-year-old. He hoped for a similar number in what could be his final season. Instead, it\u2019s been more like 2012-13, when he missed 27 games after preseason arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. The highest-scoring foreign-born player, Nowitzki is seventh on the career list with 31,187 points. He was sixth to start the season before LeBron James passed him early. James is up to fifth, and Nowitzki needs 233 points to pass Wilt Chamberlain for sixth. Nowitzki is expected to come off the bench for the first time since his rookie season in 1998-99. And he\u2019s teammates with the latest Euro sensation in 19-year-old Luka Doncic, the third overall pick and a strong contender for Rookie of the Year."},{"id":36896,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-struggles-much-ado-about-nothing-or-sign-parity","date":"2018-12-14","title":"Warriors' early-season 'struggles' much ado about nothing, or rare sign of parity?","content":" OAKLAND \u2014 Has anyone identified the best team in the NBA yet? Asking for the Warriors. There was this popularly-held vision and notion, since opening night, that the two-time defending champs, stacked once more, would use most if not all of this season to confirm the suspicions. But the record and place in the standings say otherwise, and so do the Toronto Raptors, fresh off a 20-point smackdown of the Warriors on the road and without Kawhi Leonard. So here we are, raising the question. In somewhat of an early-season surprise, the NBA penthouse seems muddled and perhaps crowded beyond the occupancy limit, with a half dozen teams claiming to a degree that they belong somewhere in the conversation. As the NBA creeps toward Christmas Day to signal the unofficial let\u2019s-start-taking-it-seriously season, there is confusion surrounding the issue of exactly who Goliath happens to be. Understand that, in the big picture, this is very much a now thing. Meaning, it doesn\u2019t really matter for another few months. Eventually the truth shall set our confused minds free. Just consider this a curious and necessary checkpoint, if nothing else. In the East, the Raptors have held it down for weeks now and boast the best record in the league, yet they\u2019re also 0-2 against the stubborn Bucks, nipping at their sneaker heels. In the West, five different teams have held the top spot since the first week of the season, and assuming the Warriors still pass everyone\u2019s smell test, there\u2019s no clear-cut No. 2. What this means: Drama. \u201cA lot of teams are playing well,\u201d said Warriors forward Kevin Durant, before checking off the Bucks, Celtics, Raptors (of course) and the look-out-here-they-come Lakers. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to figure out who will be those teams that\u2019ll be around in the end.\u201d This comes as sweet music to commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s ears, because for the last few seasons the NBA was light on suspense. Both casual and hardcore fans sighed each October and wondered how many games the Warriors would need in The Finals to wrap this up in June. Yes, some of those seasons offered up a few detours, such as the recharged Rockets last year and the LeBron James rescue act in Cleveland. But all signs pointed toward the expected finish. And that still could be the case once the Warriors find the cure for boredom or whatever is preventing them from flexing on everyone at the moment. Steve Kerr senses his team is fine for the most part, but others are anxious for a changing of the guard. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a place where we\u2019re defending a title and defending sort of a mantle that we\u2019ve had for several years, and it\u2019s a different vibe,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling than when you\u2019re on the climb like Toronto is, like Milwaukee is, like we were a few years ago. It\u2019s a different feeling, it\u2019s a different vibe. It\u2019s harder to get up for each game, and so there are certain nights where you can just feel it: You don\u2019t have that energy, and if you played in the NBA, you\u2019ve coached in this league, you understand it. If you\u2019ve followed it closely, you understand that. It\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s just reality.\u201d It\u2019s insane that this conversation is taking place about a team that has Steph Curry flirting with shooting 50 percent on 3s this season, and Durant delivering a typically excellent string of performances, and the assorted other pieces in place that have helped the Warriors win three of the last four titles. Also: Golden State should bring a bonus soon in DeMarcus Cousins, who has taken the next step in his recovery from Achilles surgery by getting reps in the G League. Yes, the Warriors have been less than perfect because of Draymond Green\u2019s temper, more missed games by Curry and a bench that\u2019s giving mixed signals. But that\u2019s to be expected, according to Kerr, who said his championship teams in Chicago and San Antonio and previous title teams with the Warriors all had their warts along the way. \u201cChampionship teams are like all the other teams,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different. It\u2019s just that their issues get more attention and are magnified more than those others. You don\u2019t go through a season without something. It just doesn\u2019t happen, no matter who you are.\u201d The Raptors just earned the best back-to-back wins of the season, looking impressive in L.A. against the Clippers and the next night in removing all suspense against the Warriors. And they did it without Leonard, bothered by a sore hip. With a few days off, Leonard could be back to finish off a tough trip in Portland and Denver. If the Raptors get a sweep, watch out. \u201cThey\u2019ve been balling before that and they\u2019ll be balling after they beat us,\u201d said Durant. \u201cThey\u2019ve been playing dominant basketball all season.\u201d With Kyle Lowry finally free of a dreadful shooting slump and Pascal Siakim making a strong run for Most Improved honors, the Raptors are bringing stars and depth. Of course, we\u2019ve seen this before. Just last season, as a matter of fact, from a Toronto team that won 59 games, then wobbled through the playoffs before LeBron crushed their hearts yet again, leading to the departures of coach Dwane Casey and franchise face DeMar DeRozan. Which means: Until the Raptors do this in May and possibly June, there\u2019s nothing special to see here. Anyway, Toronto has its attention on the rising Bucks, and Indiana finally getting Victor Oladipo back from a knee issue, and the Celtics figuring things out soon, not to mention the enigmatic-but-talented Sixers. Out West, LeBron is rolling up MVP-quality numbers yet again, weeks before he turns 34, and the Lakers are shaking off their early-season kinks. They still need to get Brandon Ingram back from a bad ankle sprain and Rajon Rondo from a bum wrist, and then attempt to make a Christmas Day statement against the Warriors in Oakland, a game that could be for first place. The Nuggets were the flavor of the month until hit suddenly with Gary Harris\u2019 strained right hip that could bench him until New Year\u2019s Day and Paul Millsap\u2019s broken toe that has him sidelined up to six weeks. Still, they\u2019re refreshed after three days off and primed for an interesting tip Friday against Oklahoma City, where the Thunder are playing the best defense in basketball and Paul George is getting as many touches as Russell Westbrook (and, frankly, doing it more efficiently). It\u2019s all refreshing now, this sudden splash of suspense and constant movement near the top of the league and at least for now, some slippage by the Warriors. \u201cThat\u2019s how it rolls sometimes,\u201d said Durant. \u201cWe just try to move forward.\u201d Here\u2019s the bad news for the rest of the NBA: He didn\u2019t seem or sound too worried about that.

Nowitzki was officially inactive Wednesday night after being listed as questionable for the first time all season. From ESPN\u2019s MacMahon: \u201cHe\u2019s getting closer,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said before the Mavs extended their home winning streak to 11 games with a 114-107 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. The Dallas Morning News reports Nowitzki was on the team flight to Phoenix for Thursday\u2019s game against the Suns. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d rookie Luka Doncic told the newspaper Wednesday night about Nowitzki\u2019s pending return. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Before the season began, Nowitzki said he was open to a reserve role on the Mavs \u2014 which is what role he is expected to fill tonight in his reported debut. Per MacMahon, Nowitzki has been practicing with the Mavs over the last few weeks, playing in 3-on-3 games after practices with Mavs player development interns. Nowitzki had surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle just before the end of the 2017-18 season. The 13-time All-Star was on schedule to be ready for the start of this campaign before suffering a major setback. He was experiencing tendon soreness before the start of training camp in September, and since then had to push his timeline back. Nowitzki, who averaged 12 points and 5.7 rebounds in 24.7 minutes per game last season, joins a scorching-hot 15-11 Mavericks team that is 8-2 in its last 10 games. He sits 232 points behind Wilt Chamberlain for No. 5 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . The 7-foot German is one of seven players overall, and the only international player, with more than 30,000 career points. He and former Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant are the only players to log 20-plus seasons with one NBA franchise. In NBA history, only five players have played 21 seasons: Kevin Garnett, Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, Moses Malone and current Atlanta Hawks swingman Vince Carter. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36931,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-lakers-flourish-early-clock","date":"2018-12-13","title":"One Team, One Stat: Lakers great early (and rough late) in shot clock","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Lakers vs. Rockets (8 ET) After a 2-5 start to their first season with LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers have found their footing. They\u2019re 15-5 since Halloween and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference , just one game behind the first-place Denver Nuggets. We knew that the Lakers would be better with the addition of James, of course. But this was a different kind of supporting cast than the ones James has had over the last several years. And indeed, this team plays differently than the one he left in Cleveland, where the pace was more deliberate and the shooting was more abundant. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Lakers\u2019 effective field goal percentage of 58.6 percent in the first 12 seconds of the shot clock. That is the league\u2019s best mark in the first 12 seconds of the shot clock through Wednesday. But in the last 12 seconds of the shot clock, the Lakers have an effective field goal percentage of just 45.2 percent, the league\u2019s worst mark. League-wide, effective field goal percentage drops with the time on the shot clock. This season, league-wide effective field goal percentage is as follows \u2026 This is a reason why a lot of teams, including the Lakers, want to play with pace. Early shots are better shots. And the Lakers are at the extremes in regard to the first 12 seconds and the last 12 seconds. They\u2019ve flourished early in the clock, and struggled late. This is not typical with LeBron James teams. Last season, the Cavs had the league\u2019s highest effective field goal percentage (52.2 percent) in the last 12 seconds of the shot clock. But the Lakers are constructed differently than the Cavs were, with more young guys and playmakers, and fewer veterans and shooters. They have the talent and speed to run the floor and get early shots, but lack the experience and catch-and-shoot skills to deal with late-clock situations. More than 29 percent of the Lakers\u2019 total points have come via fast break points (18 percent) or second-chance points (12 percent). That\u2019s the second highest rate in the league, with only the Sacramento Kings getting a lower percentage of their points from the half-court situations. The percentage of Lakers points coming via fast break points or second-chance points (29.4 percent) is almost exactly what it was last season (29.3 percent, highest in the league). The Cavs got just 21.3 percent of their points (the league\u2019s 10th lowest rate) via fast break points and second-chance points last season. So, rather than adapting to its new star this season, the Lakers\u2019 offense has maintained the same structure in regard to how it scores. L.A. has seen only a minimal bump in the percentage its shots that have come from 3-point range , a category that the Cavs ranked fourth in last season . The Lakers have seen an increase in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area, which is good. Restricted-area shots are the most valuable shots on the floor, worth 1.3 points per attempt league-wide and the Lakers\u2019 rate \u2014 restricted-area shots account for 40 percent of their total field goal attempts \u2014 is the highest of any team in the last five seasons. In his 16th season, James is still shooting better than 70 percent in the restricted area, and he has taken a greater percentage of his shots from there (42 percent) than he did in any of his first 10 seasons in the league. But when they haven\u2019t gotten to the basket, the Lakers haven\u2019t shot particularly well. They rank 26th in field goal percentage on other 2-point shots (37.0 percent) and 18th in 3-point percentage (35 percent). While James ranks as the league\u2019s third-best pull-up 3-point shooter , his team ranks 24th in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (and he\u2019s not innocent in that regard ). Through Wednesday, James ranks 10th in the league with 67 assists on 3-pointers (2.5 per game), having ranked first or second in each of the last three seasons (four per game over that time). In the last 12 seconds of the shot clock, the Lakers have seen big drops in their shooting both inside and outside the arc. And the players who have seen the biggest drops are Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball, who have combined for an effective field goal percentage of 60.5 percent in the first 12 seconds of the shot clock and just 35.0 percent in the last 12 seconds. That the Lakers rank sixth in overall effective field goal percentage is a testament to how good they are early in the clock (and how well James has shot off the dribble). Turnovers have been a bigger issue than shooting in their 15th-ranked offense . And the Lakers are evolving. This roster might look very different a year from now, and it will be interesting to see \u2014 as roster changes are made \u2014 if Los Angeles begins to look more like James\u2019 teams in Cleveland.

The \u201cHalleLuka\u201d game . The 11-0 run game.   Whatever you want to call it, it was a memorable moment that solidified him as the rookie to beat this season and proved he\u2019s a superstar in the making.    In case you missed it, Doncic was struggling against the Rockets, starting the game 3-for-13 as Dallas trailed 102-94 late in the fourth.   Then magic happened. Luka came to life.  Luka would score 11 straight points , starting with a routine 3-pointer in the corner. The Slovenian would give a slight shrug as if to say \u201cfinally\u201d and continue to knock down another stepback 3-pointer, a floater in the lane and one last insane stepback 3-pointer over 7-foot Clint Capela to cap off the 11-0 run that electrified Dallas fans and stunned the Rockets.   \u201cIt was special,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said afterward . \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that he\u2019s got a flair for the moment. He\u2019s unafraid. You don\u2019t see that every day.\u201d   Doncic is winning over teammates and fans with his level-headed approach to the game, and that midseason night in December will be Exhibit A for Doncic keeping his cool.    \u201cHe\u2019s not an ordinary 19-year-old, we\u2019ll say that,\u201d Mavs guard Devin Harris told ESPN.com. \u201cHe\u2019s got a next-play mentality, doesn\u2019t get hung up on what happened earlier in the game. With the way we play and our profession, you\u2019ve got to have that quick amnesia. He has that, and he showed it tonight.\u201d   So with the entire world raving about Doncic\u2019s heroics, what did the 19-year-old think of his performance?   \u201cIt\u2019s just basketball,\u201d said Doncic. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make shots there in Europe, you\u2019re going to make shots here. It\u2019s just confidence. This gives me a lot of confidence \u2014 believe in me a little more. I\u2019m just glad my team believes in me.\u201d    * * *      Last week:  No. 1   Doncic came down to earth a bit after his 11-0 run game. In a 101-76 rout of the Magic, Doncic scored just seven points on 2-for-11 shooting (missing all five 3-point attempts) while fellow rookie Jalen Brunson erupted for 17 points in his first career start. Doncic did notch season highs, though, with 11 rebounds and nine assists. Doncic then capped off his week with another solid performance against Trae Young, scoring 24 points with 10 rebounds and six assists as Dallas beat Atlanta for the first time since 2013.        Last week:  No. 4   Sexton is proving he\u2019s the real deal. The 6-foot-2 point guard with the unique braided rat tail has been the hottest rookie of late, leading the Cavs to wins against the Wizards and Knicks this week . The victory against John Wall and the Wizards might be his finest moment to date. Sexton scored 29 points with a season-high six assists while holding Wall to one point on 0-for-5 shooting in the Cavs\u2019 116-101 win. \u201cThis kid doesn\u2019t back down from a challenge,\u201d coach Larry Drew said afterward. \u201cI don\u2019t care who it is. He\u2019s had some pretty tough matchups thus far through the course of the season and whether win, lose or draw in those matchups, I can always say at the end of day, he has never backed down and tonight was another example playing against a guy like John Wall who is as tough as they are from a talent standpoint. He accepted the challenge tonight and he played a phenomenal game on both ends of the floor and it says a lot about who he is.\u201d Sexton has scored in double-digits in 18 straight games and shows no signs of slowing.        Last week:  No. 2   The Suns keep losing (10 and counting), but Ayton keeps putting up huge numbers. Ayton has notched double-doubles in three straight games, averaging 16 points, 11.3 rebounds and two blocks per game while shooting 65.7 percent. Ayton reportedly exchanged words with injured star Devin Booker after Tuesday\u2019s blowout loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, but brushed it off as two \u201cwinners\u201d trying to right the ship. \u201cThat\u2019s just two guys that want to win, to be honest,\u201d Ayton said after Monday\u2019s shootaround. \u201cWe just want to be winners. We are winners. It is what it is.\u201d       Last week:  Not ranked   Knox continued his resurgence this week, averaging 15.8 points and 7.5 rebounds over four losses. Coach David Fizdale is clearly giving his young rookie the reins, as he\u2019s seen his playing time surge since missing seven games early in the season with a left ankle injury. Knox\u2019s week was highlighted by a monumental 26-point, 15-rebound outing in a 119-107 loss to the Hornets in which he was 10-for-25, going 4-for-8 from beyond the arc. Knox became just the second teenager with a 25-15 game, joining LeBron James. Overall, Knox is still shooting 35.8 percent, but has improved in December to 40.4 percent (38.9 percent on 3-pointers). Knox jumps into the Top 5, and could stick around with more weeks like this.        Last week:  No. 3   The Grizzlies\u2019 rookie disappeared a bit this week. Jackson started the week with a quiet outing, notching three points and zero rebounds (his first time being shutout this season) in 15 minutes of the Grizzlies\u2019 107-103 win against the Pelicans . Jackson finished his week with a 14-point, six-rebound, two-block outing in 31 minutes of Memphis\u2019 92-83 win against the Trail Blazers , but he needs to show more consistency if he doesn\u2019t want to fall out of the Top 5.   * * *    Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  Young climbs back to just outside the Top 5 after a week with some solid performances. In his most recent meeting with Doncic, Young put up 24 points and 10 assists as Atlanta fell 114-107 in Dallas on Wednesday. It was one of Young\u2019s best shooting nights of the season, as he finished 11-for-20 from the field (2-for-6 on 3-pointers).   Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings  Sacramento has won three of its last four, and Bagley has been a big reason. In those three wins, Bagley averaged 16.7 points and 4.3 rebounds, capped off by Wednesday\u2019s 17 point, 10-rebound performance in a win against the Wolves . In the Kings\u2019 lone loss? Bagley had just four points and fouled out in just 10 minutes.   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers  He continues to run a tight ship and is drawing rave reviews from around the league, despite putting up solid (but not staggering) numbers. One star whose been impressed so far is Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant, who raved about Gilgeous-Alexander on Bill Simmons\u2019 podcast when asked which young player has impressed him most. \u201cWe played against them earlier in the year, and man\u2026 He got the midrange down. His midrange is so good. He\u2019s shooting with a high release so it\u2019s hard to block at 6-6 when a point guard\u2019s guarding him, so you gotta put a two guard on him. And he still shooting over two guards. So I\u2019m like, man, that size at that age \u2026 And once you learn how to shoot the midrange, I feel like the 3-ball is gonna be easier for you to shoot. He\u2019s knocking them down consistently. I like that he\u2019s tall, too, for that position. He\u2019s probably the guy that stood out the most because I never watched him in college. He got confidence in him.\u201d To date, Gilgeous-Alexander is shooting 47.3 percent overall and 35.9 percent on 3-pointers while averaging 10.6 points for the 17-10 Clippers.   Jalen Brunson, Dallas Mavericks  The Mavs scored with Luke Doncic, but they may have found a gem with their second-round pick. Brunson, the No. 33 pick , stepped in this week with Dennis Smith Jr. nursing a sore wrist and proved he\u2019s the real deal. In four games as a starter, the Villanova product has averaged 11.8 points and four assists while shooting 66.7 percent . Brunson scored a career-high 17 points in a 101-76 win against the Magic on Monday and drew rave reviews after his third straight game scoring in double-digits. \u201cThis is another Donnie Nelson home run. This guy is terrific,\u201d Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said, referencing the GM\u2019s history of successful Drafts. \u201cHe plays a very steady game, a very mature game for a guy who is a first-year player in the NBA. He\u2019s earned everything he\u2019s gotten here.\u201d   Wendell Carter Jr., Chicago Bulls  Carter came back down to Earth this week. He hasn\u2019t scored in double-digits in his last three games, averaging 5.7 points and 4.7 rebounds and one block in just 21.4 minutes per game. With the coaching shakeup and turmoil surrounding the Bulls , now would be a good time for Carter to establish himself as a leader and increase his production.   * * *   ( All stats through Wednesday, Dec. 12 )   Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Per Turner, the Lakers remain very interested in acquiring Ariza and people close to Ariza have said he would like to return home and play for the Lakers again. (Ariza played for L.A. from 2007-09, winning an NBA title in \u201909 .)
