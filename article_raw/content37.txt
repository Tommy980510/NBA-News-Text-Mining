Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic reports that Klay Thompson is discussing a multi-year contract extension with the Golden State Warriors. Such a move would not only lock the sharp-shooter into a longer stay in The Bay, it would also save Golden State significant money compared to re-signing him as an unrestricted free agent in 2019. Under the latter scenario, Thompson would be eligible to earn over $80 million more than if he were to sign an extension now. Thompson, however, has been adamant about his desire to remain with the Warriors for some time . \u201cPlaying for one team your whole career is definitely special,\u201d Thompson told Mark Medina of The Mercury News in February. \u201cOnly so many guys have done it in professional sports, so it\u2019ll be a goal of mine. Hopefully it all works out.\u201d Golden State is surely hoping it works out as well. The Warriors face the prospect of re-signing Kevin Durant to a max contract after he took a home team discount last summer. Stephen Curry, meanwhile, is just wrapping up the first year of a five-year, $201-million deal. If Thompson does indeed opt for an extension now, it could give Golden State the breathing room it needs to keep him, Durant, Curry and Draymond Green together for the long haul. Thompson has averaged over 20 points per game and been named an All-Star in each of the last four seasons. He owns a career 42.2-percent clip from 3-point range and is three 3-pointers away from moving to No. 10 on the NBA playoffs career leaderboard."},{"id":40553,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-thick-skin","date":"2018-05-12","title":"Kevin Love grown accustomed to roller coaster ride that comes with his role with the Cleveland Cavaliers","content":" Kevin Love doing Kevin Love things is vital to the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 postseason, which means he\u2019ll either be lauded or lambasted according either to his stats line or where each series stands at any given moment. His standing with Cavaliers fans and no small number of media critics varies wildly. The way Love has handled his place in Cleveland\u2019s pecking order behind LeBron James through four years of long playoff runs sometimes earns him the respect shown over time to former Miami big man and future Hall of Famer Chris Bosh. Then the calendar flips a time or two and you\u2019d think Love was Fredo Corleone (h\/t Shaq). By the time this Cavs era is done, we can expect to hear clamoring once again to trade Love. Along with the statue of him they\u2019ll have erected outside of Quicken Loans Arena by then. That\u2019s how capricious this whole thing can be. It\u2019s the old quote from Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter \u2013 \u201cThe sun don\u2019t shine on the same dog\u2019s [tail] all the time\u201d \u2013 sped up and spun faster for the social media age. Love has endured the supporters and the skeptics long enough to have climbed into fourth place on Cleveland\u2019s all-time playoff scoring list, his 815 points surpassing Zydrunas Ilgauskas (784) and Brad Daugherty (782 ). But these are \u201cthe history of now\u201d times in which we live, and the 6-foot-10 power forward\/stretch four\/center (as circumstances dictate) has learned not to react to every slight or bit of praise. \u201cThat kind of almost transcends sports,\u201d Love said after Cleveland\u2019s series-clinching Game 4 against Toronto this week. \u201cIt becomes so much of \u2018What have you done for me lately?\u2019 It\u2019s pretty\u2026 I don\u2019t know if fickle is the right word, but it\u2019s so hit-and-miss. If you have one bad game, people will jump on you. They\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh he\u2019s trash. He\u2019s not this , he\u2019s not that .\u2019\u201d It sounds so illusory, with the staying power of a sugar cube in a thunderstorm. Paper thin. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s paper thin,\u201d Love said in his corner of the Cavs\u2019 locker room at the Q. In a few minutes, the 10-year veteran would take to the podium alongside James to talk about their 11th consecutive Eastern Conference series victory in their four years together. One poor performance, though, and \u2013 not just Love \u2013 they\u2019d both be hearing about it. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned, in sports, fortune and momentum can change so fast,\u201d Love said. \u201cI think you saw that, especially after Game 7 [against Indiana]  and then the fashion in which we won Game 1 [against Toronto] \u2013 we didn\u2019t take our first lead until overtime. I think that changed our postseason and put us in a more positive light. \u201cGuys started getting more success throughout our entire lineup. Guys started seeing more playoff time than they\u2019d ever seen prior. Now we get a sweep, a few days rest and hopefully a chance to bounce back [to the Finals].\u201d Yet it was only two weeks ago that James himself put some pressure on Love to step up, like, y\u2019know, right now. \u201cHe\u2019s a huge part of our success or our non-success,\u201d the Cleveland superstar said of Love after they got blown out in Game 6 of the first round in Indianapolis . That night, Love missed seven of his 10 shots and finished with seven points. James sounded frustrated and, naturally, fans and media followed his lead. \u201cWe try to go to him, we want to go to him,\u201d James said. \u201cWe can\u2019t make the shots for him. He has to step up and knock those down.\u201d Love didn\u2019t flinch. In fact, he helped the Cavaliers advance with 14 points in Game 7 , hitting half of his eight 3-point attempts. Forty-eight hours later, he shot 3-of-13 in Game 1 against Toronto to again finish with seven points. And so, it goes. Love is averaging 14.7 points and 10.1 rebounds this postseason , but his scoring average is off by nearly three points from the regular season . He\u2019s shooting 39.4 percent in these playoffs compared to 45.8 in 2017-18\u2019s first 82. The regular season wasn\u2019t without its hurdles for Love, either. There was adapting to All-Star Kyrie Irving\u2019s requested trade and absence, with Love bumping up in theory to No. 2 after James. Then he was out from Jan. 31 to March 19 with a broken left hand and the team\u2019s roster was overhauled in his absence at the trade deadline . By the time he returned, only four Cavs remained \u2013 James, Love, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson \u2013 from the 2016 championship team. Everybody was adjusting to everybody in the season\u2019s final weeks. But Love knew by then not to take any of it, or folks\u2019 reactions, very personally. Recalling this stage of the playoffs \u2013 the East finals in 2016 \u2013 Love said: \u201cI came out and had two really good games and two not-so-good games against Toronto. Everybody said, \u2018Oh, the Cavaliers have a \u2018Kevin Love problem.\u2019 And that\u2019s been pretty typical. OK, I just kept my mouth shut. \u201cAnd [former Cavs reserve] Channing Frye and I talked, and he was like, \u2018Listen, when I was in the Western Conference finals, I went 1 for 19.\u2019 So, it was like, \u2018You think you\u2019re having a bad day?\u2019\u201d Frye in fact made only one of his first 21 shots for Phoenix in the first three games of the 2010 West finals against the Lakers, including 18 misses in a row. But the former Suns forward\/center made nine of 20 3-point attempts over the next three games and wasn\u2019t the reason the Lakers prevailed. After his chat with Frye, Love said, \u201cWe came out in Games 5 and 6, got a win here, played great, then got a win in Toronto to close out the series. So, it just goes to show you, people will turn for both good and for bad. Both ways. That\u2019s just the way it is in sports. You just have to live hand by hand \u2013 but know what you\u2019re capable of. Because if not, you can go down a rabbit hole.\u201d Love\u2019s ongoing challenge this spring has been Cavs coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s use of him at center vs. Love\u2019s preference for the power forward spot. The defensive matchups are tougher in the middle, his offensive mismatches trickier to create and exploit. But Lue likes loading up his starting lineup with shooters around James, and Love at the five allows for Kyle Korver and J.R. Smith both to start along with George Hill. When Thompson does play off the bench, Loves gets to shift. \u201cHe\u2019s making shots, he\u2019s playing with a real good pace,\u201d Lue said Monday. \u201cDefensively he\u2019s got a few blocked shots, some deflections at the basket. He\u2019s been good for us. We\u2019ve got to continue to keep going to him. \u2026 Kevin\u2019s been doing a really good job just changing his pace and speeds.\u201d Love\u2019s ability to pull Toronto\u2019s Jonas Valanciunas or Serge Ibaka outside in Games 2 and 3 of the East semis, good for a total of 53 points on 18-of-35 shooting, prompted Raptors coach Dwane Casey to move Valanciunas to the bench for Game 4. Didn\u2019t matter, Love scored 23 in the Cavaliers\u2019 breezy victory. Casey called Love \u201cone of the more clever\u201d bigs in the league. \u201cAlways doing different things,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s efficient whether screen-and-rolling with LeBron or screen-and-rolling with George Hill. He knows how to get you into a switch when we\u2019re trying to avoid it. As much as we try to, it happens and we\u2019ve got to be prepared for when it does, with a small switched onto him.\u201d Love and Korver have developed chemistry in that area, too, over their 16 months together. It\u2019s the sort of thing that might help against Boston in this round, given the Celtics\u2019 defensive capabilities and tactics. Which means Love \u2013 who averaged 22.6 points and 12.4 rebounds on 53.5 percent 3-point shooting against Boston in last year\u2019s postseason \u2013 could be heaped with praise by series\u2019 end. Or just buried, if the numbers don\u2019t add up for him and the Cavs. It\u2019s what he expected when taking on the Bosh role among LeBron sidekicks, it\u2019s something that no longer rocks his world. Heck, it\u2019s a part of all of our world, a madly swinging pendulum. A strong core, a thick skin and a good shrug are the best defense. \u201cYou see it every day, whether it\u2019s politics or sports or pop culture,\u201d Love said. \u201cThere\u2019s this 24-hour news cycle and there has to be some sort of story. \u201cLike I said after Game 2 [against the Raptors, in which he pounded them inside while scoring 31 points], \u2018I didn\u2019t forget how to play basketball.\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s a bad matchup. I was missing some uncharacteristic shots. But there were other things I was doing out there. It\u2019s not I just forgot how to play. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is sometimes.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Atlanta reached an agreement Lloyd Pierce to become the franchise\u2019s new head coach, the team announced on Friday. Pierce arrives fresh off a second-round run with Philadelphia as an assistant coach. His five-year run with the 76ers came after assistant coaching stints with Memphis, Golden State and Cleveland. Pierce\u2019s most recent experience plays into the Hawks\u2019 plans to rebuild from the ground up, a project that begins with the three first-round draft picks the team owns this summer. Pierce witnessed and played a role in Philadelphia\u2019s draft-driven turnaround that saw the 76ers go from bottom-feeder to conference up-and-comer. The hiring of Pierce comes weeks after Atlanta and former head coach Mike Budenholzer parted ways . Budenholzer led the Hawks to one of the most successful eras in franchise history, including the team\u2019s only trip to the conference finals since its move to Atlanta in 1968. The core of that Hawks team, however, was slowly dismantled by trades and free agency.

After spending time with ownership, it\u2019s clear they have a deep investment in and commitment to making this a model organization. This opportunity is a perfect fit for me, and I\u2019m eager to get started.\u201d Pierce spent the 2010-11 season as an Assistant Coach with the Golden State Warriors after three years as Assistant Coach-Player Development with Cleveland (2007-10), where the Cavaliers made three playoff appearances and a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2009. Prior to his NBA coaching career, Pierce was an Assistant Coach at his alma mater, Santa Clara University, from 2002-07.

The news of his ousting was first reported by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and confirmed shortly thereafter in a statement by the Raptors. \u201cAfter careful consideration, I have decided this is a very difficult but necessary step the franchise must take. As a team, we are constantly trying to grow and improve in order to get to the next level,\u201d Toronto GM Masai Ujiri said in a statement released by the team today . \u201cWe celebrate everything Dwane has done for the organization, we thank him, and we wish him nothing but the best in future. He was instrumental in creating the identity and culture of who we are as a team, and we are so proud of that.\u201d Per Wojnarowski, the Raptors have their eye on former Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer for Casey\u2019s old job : In addition, TNT analyst David Aldridge reports via Twitter that the Raptors have several strong in-house candidates who could contend for the job as well: Jeff Zillgitt of USA Today  reports via Twitter that Casey may have sought an extension from the Raptors, which could have played a part in Casey\u2019s firing: Ujiri met with reporters on Friday and addressed the firing of Casey, saying he broke the news to the former coach this morning. He told reporters he had been meeting with Casey every day since the Raptors were eliminated from the playoffs. Additionally, Ujiri called Raptors stars DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry to let them know about the coaching change. \u201cThere\u2019s five years of bond here. You can actually feel it in every single (player) I\u2019ve talked to so far,\u201d Ujiri said. Per Ujiri, the Raptors plan to keep the rest of their coaching staff in place. The assistant coaches listed on last season\u2019s team were: Nurse, Stackhouse, Rex Kalamian, Jama Mahlalela, Jamaal Magloire and Alex McKechnie as well as trainer Scott McCullough. Casey was named the eighth coach in Raptors history on June 21, 2011 . He posted a 320-238 (.573) record during that span, including the only three 50-win seasons in team history. Under him, the Raptors won four Atlantic Division titles and advanced to the postseason in a franchise-record five consecutive seasons. He was the longest-tenured coach in team history and the franchise\u2019s all-time winningest coach. Casey led the Raptors to a team-record 59-23 mark in 2017-18 and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference . But the Raptors were swept in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers, setting in motion an earlier-than-expected offseason for Toronto. Two days ago, Casey was named the NBCA Coach of the Year, an award that is voted on by a panel of his coaching peers . After the Raptors\u2019 playoff ouster, Casey spoke candidly with the media and, at the time, sounded confident he would be with the team . \u201cNobody has told me differently,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cUntil then I\u2019m here still fighting. I\u2019m still here. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a vote of confidence [from Ujiri] \u2026 I\u2019ve read all the articles, texts, all this stuff. I understand what\u2019s been said. I\u2019m not in the dark, but I\u2019m not looking for a vote of confidence because I haven\u2019t heard anything different.\u201d Casey also said he recognized how the criticism falls on him after the type of series Toronto endured. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy. I\u2019ve been through it. I know what we\u2019ve accomplished and how the basketball world respects what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s part of the territory. I accept it. I\u2019m not running from it. \u2026 I\u2019m an easy target \u2026 I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, let\u2019s put it that way. \u201d At that same news conference, Ujiri said he planned to look at the roster and team as a whole and make assessments as to the future of it. In short, the next steps for the team at large is entering an evaluation process, Ujiri said, which will take place in the coming weeks. \u201cWe are absolutely disappointed with the ending of the season,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cI think our guys are tough enough. They\u2019ve fought through it. To win in this league, you have to go through different stages \u2026 You build from that experience. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not doomsday. Where our program is, it\u2019s not doomsday.\u201d On Friday, in the wake of Casey\u2019s firing, Ujiri said roster changes could be next. But, he was quick to point out the timetable for those changes are hardly known at this point. \u201cIt is something we\u2019re looking at \u2026 not saying this roster is perfect,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThings we need to do and I need to do to get better. Roster changes is not something I can change today. Sometimes [it takes] takes 2 months, sometimes a year, sometimes two years.\u201d Toronto\u2019s deepest playoff run came in 2016 when it lost to the eventual-champion Cavaliers in a six-game Eastern Conference finals. After their record season, though, the Raptors\u2019 series loss to the Cavs was as tough a defeat as the All-Star DeRozan has endured. \u201cThis is probably the toughest, most frustrating, difficult, lowest feeling I\u2019ve had,\u201d DeRozan said Tuesday. \u201cYou get to that point where you\u2019re standing firm through everything and you feel like you can\u2019t get knocked down again, and you realize you do get knocked back down again. It\u2019s kind of the worst feeling.\u201d \u201cWe felt like we could possibly make the NBA Finals,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cThat was our goal.\u201d The series slipped away after a Game 1 loss in which the Raptors coughed up a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, missed multiple potential winning baskets, and lost 113-112 in overtime. Toronto nearly rallied to win Game 3, but James banked in a remarkable tie-breaking basket at the buzzer. Neither Lowry nor DeRozan directly endorsed Casey on Tuesday, but both spoke glowingly about their coach. \u201cAll of my success, I have to credit Casey,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m always going to have the utmost respect when it comes to coach Casey.\u201d Lowry acknowledged he and Casey have clashed over the years, but said he\u2019s \u201calways believed in him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best coaches out there,\u201d Lowry said.

Phoenix and New York did likewise days before that, with the Suns hiring Utah Jazz assistant Igor Kokoskov and the Knicks hiring former Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale . Joe Prunty held the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 coaching job \u2014 albeit on an interim basis \u2014 for most of last season. However, the Bucks are still in the thick of their coaching search and will have two key interviews in the coming days. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \u2018s Matt Velazquez, the Bucks plan to meet with former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt and current Spurs assistant Becky Hammon. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski and Velazquez (via Twitter) on what\u2019s next for the Bucks: Spurs coach Gregg Popovich hired Hammon to the Spurs coaching staff in 2014, making her the first female full-time assistant in the NBA . Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star, also made history in 2015 when she became the first female coach in NBA Summer League, guiding the Spurs to a Las Vegas championship . Hammon, 41, would be the fourth Spurs assistant to interview for a coaching job this spring. Borrego, Ettore Messina and Ime Udoka have already interviewed for several openings. She had been in discussions to interview for the Bucks\u2019 vacancy as of last week. Velazquez also reports that Messina has already interviewed with the Bucks for their opening, too . Additionally, Spurs forward Pau Gasol \u2014 in a piece he wrote for The Players\u2019 Tribune on Friday \u2014 praised Hammon\u2019s qualifications as a coach : Blatt led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in 2014-15, his first season in the NBA. He got off to a 30-11 start in 2015-16, but was fired season and replaced by associate head coach Tyronn Lue. One of Europe\u2019s most celebrated coaches before he was hired in Cleveland, Blatt, now coaching in Turkey, went 83-40 in his tenure with the Cavs. In August of 2017, Blatt told The Jerusalem Post that he wanted to coach again in the NBA .

They also, however, have a healthy respect for their Western Conference finals opponent. Golden State coach Steve Kerr anticipates that his players will have the appropriate motivaiton required to make a fourth consecutive NBA Finals appearance. The road to do so goes through top-seeded Houston Rockets this year, a team that features a star point guard (Chris Paul) and coach (Mike D\u2019Antoni) bent on making their first career Finals appearance. Kerr believes the Warriors have the proper mentality to meet the Rockets\u2019 challenge head-on. \u201cThey are taking the challenge and they\u2019re embracing it,\u201d Kerr told reporters on Thursday. \u201cBut we seem to be at our best when we are threatened.

But just how far can The Process take them? * Was a 52-win season that ended with a five-game loss to the Boston Celtics in the conference semis just part of the learning curve on the way toward NBA titles? * Or are the Sixers destined to become a Toronto\/Indiana-type of franchise where strong regular seasons end up with postseason disappointment and championships? Those are suddenly fun problems for a team to have only two years removed from a 10-win season and serious doubts about the future of a rebuilding plan both condemned and praised by zealots on both sides. Joel Embiid (22.9 points, 11 rebounds) made his first All-Star team and seemed worth every bit of the $148 million, five-year extension he signed before the season. Ben Simmons was a regular triple-double threat and emerged as a favorite to win rookie of the year. Those two should anchor Philly\u2019s run for the next decade, a Russell Westbrook\/Kevin Durant tandem of sorts that should make them playoff regulars until they are in their 30s. Yes, there was a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season, a first-round playoff series win over Miami and so much hoopla over rapper Meek Mill that it seemed like the Sixers had the ingredients to throw a parade this season. There are serious questions ahead about who will team with Embiid and Simmons to form a championship core \u2013 and plenty of room to grow for both franchise stars. \u201cIf we all sat in that room when we met back in September, and said we\u2019re going to finish third in the Eastern conference, we\u2019re going to lose in the semifinals of the Eastern Conference, there\u2019s a strong chance we all would have been hugging each other,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cThe initial goal was to make the playoffs. The final piece is, if we\u2019re going to do anything of any significance.\u201d They did, which makes this offseason about as key as any in recent 76ers history for team president Bryan Colangelo. Here\u2019s what else to know about the 76ers: FULTZ FLOP No doubt about it, the Sixers got outplayed by Boston in the playoffs \u2013 and last year\u2019s draft. It was a gut-punch for every Sixers fan who watched Jayson Tatum torch the Sixers while Markelle Fultz rode the bench. The Sixers, of course, swapped the No. 3 pick to Boston (who took Tatum) for the No. 1 pick (Fultz). It\u2019s too early to call a 19-year-old No. 1 pick a bust (right? \u2026 right?) but Fultz is certainly trending that way after a pitiful rookie year derailed by a mysterious shoulder injury, a broken shot and confidence issues. He played the first four games, missed 68 games because of injury, then was persona non grata in the postseason. Simmons-Embiid-Fultz were expected to form a trio of stars that would lead the Sixers to the top. Fultz\u2019s ignominious first year instead made him more of a mystery than when the Sixers selected him out of Washington. Fultz said it hasn\u2019t been discussed if he\u2019ll play summer league. REDICK FUTURE JJ Redick said he enjoyed his season with the Sixers about as much as any over his 12-year career. Redick averaged 17.1 points and shot 42 percent from 3-point range on a $23 million, one-year deal. Will he return? Redick would like to return but it\u2019s doubtful the Sixers would offer him that kind of cash, even on a shortened deal. FREE AGENTS The Sixers are flush with cash to go on a spending spree. The sometimes-forgotten part of The Process wasn\u2019t just jettisoning players to lose and gobble draft picks. It was clearing money on the salary cap to put them in position to sign major free agents. The Sixers have $70 million in committed salary next year, leaving them with about $31 million to play with this summer to make a run at LeBron James or Paul George or overpay a lower-tiered free agent. SPEAKING OF LEBRON James is a mentor of Simmons and their friendship could be a factor in the Cleveland star\u2019s defection to Philly. Or not. Who knows what James will do this summer, and he could still have another month of basketball left to play. One Pennsylvania company paid for three billboards in Ohio urging James to sign with the 76ers this summer. James, who famously left Cleveland in 2010 and signed with the Miami Heat, could bolt again if he feels the Cavs and 76ers are both trending in different directions. THE BIG 3-0 Simmons can drive the lane as well any guard in the league. He sure can\u2019t shoot like the best, though. Simmons failed to make a 3-pointer this season (on 11 attempts) and Fultz didn\u2019t make one either in just 14 games. Simmons attempted just one 3 in the postseason. He\u2019ll have to establish some sort of long-range jumper to become a serious all-around threat in the NBA. \u201cIt just takes time, shooting the ball,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you want to improve your game and get better.\u201d"},{"id":46819,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-boston-celtics-intertwined-big-trade","date":"2018-05-11","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics intertwined since big trade","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Boston playoff star Jayson Tatum and Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue are cousins. The Cavaliers and Celtics might as well be. The Eastern Conference\u2019s top two teams have been intertwined for more than a year \u2013 from a summer blockbuster trade, from opening night, from afar. Although there were long stretches this season when it seemed at least unlikely, and maybe impossible, that the Celtics and Cavs would reach the conference finals, they\u2019re back again and meeting in the playoffs for the third time in four years. The series everyone wanted. The one few expected to see. And yet here they are: the odds-defying Celtics, guided by baby-faced coach Brad Stevens and prospering without injured stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, versus the Cavs, who despite a massive roster makeover in February are rolling as 33-year-old LeBron James enhances his legend with every game. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s happened throughout the season with us and for them,\u201d Cavs forward Kevin Love said Thursday as Cleveland prepared for Sunday\u2019s series opener in Boston. \u201cBoth teams have raised their level of play and been through it, but are here now and have to lay it all on the line.\u201d It\u2019s hard to process how much has changed for these teams since they played last May. Major moves, injuries, upheaval. After the Cavs beat the Celtics in five games in last year\u2019s conference finals to advance to their third straight NBA Finals, there were no hints the two franchises would ramp up their rivalry with a trade that caught their entire league, well, off-guard. The Cavs succumbed to Irving\u2019s trade demand \u2013 he was tired of playing in James\u2019 shadow \u2013 and sent the All-Star to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, a first-round draft pick, forward Jae Crowder and center Ante Zizic. The 5-foot-9 Thomas had bravely carried the Celtics in the 2017 postseason despite a balky hip and broken heart following his sister\u2019s death in a car crash. With so many subplots, the league scheduled Boston at Cleveland in the season opener. However, Irving\u2019s awkward reunion with James was quickly overshadowed by Hayward, Boston\u2019s big free-agent signing, grotesquely breaking his ankle just feet from the horrified Cavs bench. As Hayward left on a stretcher, the Celtics\u2019 season seemed to be riding to the hospital with him. Boston, though, showed grit and reeled off 16 straight wins before injuries resurfaced. Marcus Smart had thumb surgery and the Celtics lost Irving, who needed more knee surgery and won\u2019t get a crack at dethroning James. Irving will watch this series from the bench. Thomas is much farther away. He spent the first two months in Cleveland trying to get healthy, but wasn\u2019t the same when he came back and never connected with his new teammates. With Thomas a mess and the season slipping away, Cavs general manager Koby Altman traded him on Feb. 8 to the Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. Altman didn\u2019t stop there, dealing Crowder and Derrick Rose to Utah for Rodney Hood, sending Dwyane Wade back to Miami and acquiring point guard George Hill from Sacramento. Three days after the trade, the new-look Cavs beat the Celtics 121-99 in Boston as Hill, Clarkson and Hood combined for 44 points to the delight of James, who seemed rejuvenated after weeks of moping. He\u2019s now on a mission as he prepares to face the Celtics for the seventh time in the postseason. James is averaging 34.3 points, 9.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in 11 games in these playoffs, which has included him making two buzzer-beaters, scoring 45 points in Game 7 to oust Indiana and dispatching Toronto with shocking ease. \u201cLeBron\u2019s on just a ridiculous run of play,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019ll be quite a challenge.\u201d The Celtics may not have anyone of James\u2019 stature, but they have a complete team that\u2019s clicking. Tatum and Jaylen Brown are two of the game\u2019s rising young stars and Cleveland native Terry Rozier has emerged as a postseason menace, filling in for Irving and quickly winning over Boston fans, who have dubbed him \u201cScary Terry.\u201d Lue knows the Cavs have their hands full. \u201cThey\u2019re well-coached,\u201d Lue said. \u201cDespite all the circumstances of guys getting hurt with Kyrie out, with Gordon being out for the whole year, they just keep plugging guys in and keep playing. (Boston executive) Danny Ainge has done a good job of getting guys in that fit that mold of Celtics basketball and they\u2019ve been playing well.\u201d Especially the 20-year-old Tatum. He averaged 23.6 points in Boston\u2019s series win over the Philadelphia 76ers, who didn\u2019t do enough to slow him down. That now falls on Lue, who has known Tatum \u2013 or \u201cLittle J\u201d as he called him \u2013 since he was a kid. They\u2019re related on Lue\u2019s grandfather\u2019s side of the family. Six years ago, a 14-year-old Tatum posted a picture of himself with James on Twitter and asked Cleveland\u2019s superstar to follow him. Lue smiled when shown a picture of his cousin. \u201cNow look,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d"},{"id":46924,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-james-borrego-official-release","date":"2018-05-10","title":"Charlotte Hornets officially hire James Borrego as head coach","content":"Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations & General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today the team has named James Borrego head coach.

They laughed. The chaotic Cavaliers have dealt with bigger nonsense this season. \u201cThey was like, `Hood, that\u2019s not really a distraction\u2019 because of everything that they\u2019ve been through this year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they all took light of it. They understand, so it wasn\u2019t anything really.\u201d Hood added another distraction to a season full of them on Tuesday night when he waved off coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s request to replace LeBron James during the fourth quarter of the Cavs\u2019 blowout win over the Raptors. The Cavs were ahead by 30 when Hood, whose playing time has dwindled in the postseason, told Lue to put in Jose Calderon instead. Hood said he told Lue to \u201cjust let Jose play\u201d and then regretted his decision. \u201cI should have known because I didn\u2019t play throughout the duration of the game that it was gonna look bad, but it wasn\u2019t (as bad) as people was trying to make it,\u201d Hood said. \u201cNext time I\u2019m definitely going to go in. I apologized to T-Lue for any confusion and stuff like that but that\u2019s all it was. \u201cI should have took it more serious and went in there and got some reps up and get in a little rhythm.\u201d The Cavs did not fine or suspend the 25-year-old Hood, who came to Cleveland in a Feb. 8 trade from Utah. Both before and after Hood arrived, the Cavs, who will open the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday in Boston, have dealt with a lengthy list of disruptions. There was the heated team meeting in which some players confronted Kevin Love for missing time. There was the roster overhaul at the trading deadline. There was Lue\u2019s medical absence, Tristan Thompson\u2019s relationship with reality TV star Khloe Kardashian and almost constant speculation surrounding superstar LeBron James\u2019 future. A season-long soap opera. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Lue said of the Cavs\u2019 circus. But Love said Hood has been forgiven and it\u2019s likely the Cavs will need him against the Celtics and maybe beyond. \u201cI was that guy before,\u201d Love said. \u201cNot even that it\u2019s a second chance, but things like that happen in the course of a season. I\u2019ve only known Rodney for a short period of time, but I know he\u2019s a great guy. I know he\u2019s here to win. Was that a great decision? Maybe not. But he came in today, said he\u2019s all in and we believe him. That\u2019s why we were able to laugh it off.\u201d There\u2019s nothing funny about Hood\u2019s recent play. He started Game 1 in the opening round against Indiana, but has not been effective coming off the bench. He scored just two points in the three games against the Raptors on 1 of 9 shooting. Hood, though, is confident he can contribute. Just three days after joining the Cavs, he had one of his best games on Feb. 11 at Boston, scoring 15 points. He\u2019s hoping for another shot. \u201cI haven\u2019t played well regardless of what minutes I get, I gotta have a positive impact on the game and that\u2019s the frustrating part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good thing about it is that we gotta a lot of basketball left and it\u2019s just next play, next series and try to get better.\u201d"},{"id":46838,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oklahoma-city-thunder-nick-collison-retires-nba","date":"2018-05-10","title":"Veteran big man Nick Collison retires after 15 seasons in NBA","content":" Oklahoma City Thunder forward Nick Collison announced today that he will retire after 15 years with the organization.

Additionally, Collison saw action in 91 postseason games where he averaged 4.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in 16.8 minutes. \u201cMy goal was always to make a career out of basketball, and I was blessed to be in the NBA for 15 seasons,\u201d said Collison. \u201cAs my time as a basketball player comes to an end, I\u2019m so grateful for my family, friends, teammates, coaches, fans, my hometown, Kansas University, the Thunder organization and everyone else who has helped me along the way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. It has been an incredible journey that I\u2019m proud of, and it would not have been possible to do it on my own.\u201d The Iowa Falls native is one of five NBA players to have spent the past 15 or more seasons all with a single franchise. \u201cI so vividly recall that the first person I saw in the practice gym after the purchase of the team was Nick Collison, working on his jump shot,\u201d said Thunder Chairman, Clayton I.

Nick has helped define the standards we work by on a day-to-day basis, on and off the court and has become synonymous with the Thunder shield. He is a craftsman; tough, selfless and humble. He brought the best of himself his entire career each day he walked through the door. As result of his consistency and longevity, his contributions to our culture and community will have a lasting effect. That is rare in any industry, but especially professional sports.

In what could have offered some poetic closure to the Eastern Conference portion of this season, former Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving would be taking on his old team and, specifically, LeBron James, the superstar \u201cbig brother\u201d whom he\u2019d dissed by demanding a trade . Meanwhile, in a more perfect pulp-fiction world, Cleveland would be setting loose point guard Isaiah Thomas on the Boston Celtics, giving him a chance for payback to the team that dealt him away the instant it sniffed the chance to land Irving. Those plotlines are kaput; Irving\u2019s season ended in March with left knee surgery , Thomas got dealt from Cleveland at the February trade deadline . The best we\u2019ll get now are sideline shots of Irving in street clothes on Boston\u2019s bench, reacting to the series\u2019 ebbs and flows. Thomas might be limited to tweeting from afar. That leaves one clear, distinct narrative: The King of the East vs. perhaps the best collection of aspirants to his throne. James is trying to cap one of his most remarkable seasons by advancing to his eighth consecutive Finals, having led the Cavaliers to the past three after four with the Miami Heat. He has coaxed and carried these Cavs along a steep learning curve, finally getting them spiffed up by the end of their sweep of Toronto . \u201cHe\u2019s been doing this for a long time,\u201d Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart said after the clincher over Philadelphia. \u201cHe\u2019s, if not the greatest, one of the greatest to do it. What better way than to go up and compete against a guy that\u2019s [going to have] statues and things like that.\u201d The Celtics, by contrast, are a team trying to write fresh history. They\u2019re ahead of schedule, too , given Irving\u2019s absence and the loss of prize free agent Gordon Hayward way back on opening night to a gruesome leg injury, coincidentally, in Cleveland. Boston put out a talented Milwaukee Bucks club in the opening round , then dumped the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 another rising franchise in the East \u2013 in five games. And for those who think the West has the sexier conference clash, this one offers a pretty slick matchup: James against Boston coach Brad Stevens. Widely regarded as a master tactician, Stevens \u2014 whose Celtics lost in five games to the Cavaliers in last year\u2019s East finals \u2014 gets another multi-game shot. In last year\u2019s series, James averaged these numbers to beat: 29.6 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 6.8 apg, 2.2 spg and 1.2 bpg. 18.5 \u2014  The Cavs scored 121.5 points per 100 possessions in the conference semifinals against Toronto , 18.5 more than they scored in the first round against Indiana ( 103.0 ). The Indy series was too close for comfort; The Pacers actually outscored Cleveland by 40 points in the series and Cavs not named James registered an effective field goal percentage of just 47 percent (the league average is 52 percent). But things were much different against the No. 1 seed, with Kyle Korver and J.R. Smith combining to shoot 24-for-38 (63 percent) from 3-point range and Kevin Love recovering from a funk to average 25 points on 54 percent shooting over the final three games . The Cavs\u2019 defense remains a question, but they always have the ability to score points in bunches. The Celtics had the No. 1 defense in the regular season and the regular season series was on the ugly side (the teams combined to score just 100 points per 100 possessions), but Boston will have to pick its poison with James surrounded by shooters that have started to shoot well. \u2014 John Schuhmann The Cavaliers won two of the three meetings between these teams in the regular season, with their more impressive victory coming mere days after the Cleveland roster makeover at the trade deadline. The Cavs were plus-11 in the season series, James averaged 24.0 ppg, 10.3 rpg and 8.3 apg, Boston shot 30-of-106 from three and \u2026 aw, who are we kidding? Regular season results matter little now. James is determined to win his 24th consecutive Eastern Conference series to reach his eighth straight Finals. He was a maestro vs. the Raptors in drawing out his teammates\u2019 games. The Celtics, allowing for their injuries, already have overachieved. That ends here.

Just wait until Hayward and Irving are healthy and Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum have developed. The looking-forward-to-next-season mantra still rings true. The Celtics have an incredibly bright future. But the present looks pretty good too, because more than anything, the injuries to Hayward ( lost in the first game of the season ) and Irving ( out since early March ) have provided opportunities for Brown, Tatum and Terry Rozier to develop at an accelerated pace. And how quickly they\u2019ve developed is a big reason why the Celtics are heading back to the Eastern Conference finals after a 114-112 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Wednesday. After his team won its first-round series against the Miami Heat , Sixers coach Brett Brown spoke of how the playoffs would accelerate the learning curve for his young players. \u201cThe team will learn in, I think, an expedited way,\u201d Brown said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re in such a rigorous, competitive environment as the playoffs.\u201d But the same applied to Brown and Tatum as well as Rozier \u2014 a third-year player, but one who was never a starting point guard until two months ago. And when this series was over, Celtics coach Brad Stevens sounded a lot like Brown did two weeks ago. \u201cAll these experiences are times three with this group,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting an expedited learning curve. They\u2019re not getting \u2018play a little bit as a rookie and the next year play a little bit more.\u2019 It\u2019s like \u2018you\u2019re all playing a lot and let\u2019s figure it out on the fly.\u2019 \u201d So while we saw the Celtics have a much harder time getting out of the first round than the Sixers did, Stevens saw his team figure out how to deal with a long and disruptive defense. And in regard to applying lessons learned in the first round, the Celtics were the better young team in Round 2. \u201cIn this series, we benefited from how hard the Milwaukee series was,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cbecause we had to scratch, claw and fight just to get out of that thing. And we got killed on the road. It was hard to generate baskets because of their length and athleticism.\u201d In the regular season, the Celtics scored just 99 points per 100 possessions (a rate worse than the worst offense in the league) over the 11 games they played against playoff teams without Irving. They\u2019ve had some ugly performances in the postseason, including a rough stretch in the second half on Wednesday, but have scored 107 points per 100 possessions over their 12 playoff games. It was a given they\u2019d be able to hold up defensively; this was the No. 1 defensive team in the regular season . But that they\u2019ve found multiple ways to score is why the Celtics have been a surprise. Rozier isn\u2019t Irving, but he does have some juice off the dribble, he\u2019s got plenty of confidence and he can shoot. In fact, he leads the postseason with 38 made 3-pointers . Though he didn\u2019t have his best game on Wednesday, he made big plays on both ends of the floor and was the player who got this series started off right for the Celtics, scoring 29 points in Game 1. Meanwhile, the two players that were supposed to take over a few years from now decided not to wait. Tatum and Brown, just 20 and 21 years old, respectively, led the Celtics with 25 and 24 points in Game 5. After seeing their offense disappear in Games 3 and 4, the Celtics found it again upon returning home. Brown made 10 of his 13 shots. He went to work early, scoring six of the Celtics\u2019 first eight points, taking advantage of matchups against J.J. Redick (who he took into the post) and Dario Saric (who he took off the dribble). In the second half, he found space on the perimeter and drained five of his six shots from outside the paint, including all three of his 3-point attempts. He has quickly become a complete offensive player, one with the Celtics\u2019 two highest scoring games (34 and 30 points) of the postseason. \u201cA lot of young players think they have it all figured out,\u201d Celtics big man Al Horford said when asked about Brown after Game 5. \u201cThey want to do things a certain way. Jaylen has that growth mind set. You see it in him and he keeps getting better. There\u2019s no surprise why we\u2019re in this position. If he and Tatum weren\u2019t growing as players, we couldn\u2019t have been at this point. It\u2019s a lot of credit to them.\u201d Early in the season, Tatum benefited from getting his most of his touches against a rotating defense, which allowed him to shoot off the catch or attack openings that were already there. The rookie was excellent in that regard, but he didn\u2019t have to be the guy who created those openings for others. Six months later, the Celtics were running their offense through Tatum for large stretches of the conference semifinals and asking him to make pick-and-roll decisions against one of the best defensive teams in the league. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d Tatum said of the added responsibility. \u201cYou work all season to earn the trust of your teammates and coaching staff for moments like this.\u201d And with less than two minutes to go on Wednesday, with the Sixers up four and the series threatening to return to Philadelphia for Game 6, the Celtics ran three straight possessions through Tatum. An isolation drive past Ben Simmons got him to the line for a pair of free throws. A drive away from Horford\u2019s screen produced an alley-oop dunk for the big man. And another drive around Simmons resulted in a tip-in from Marcus Smart that tied the score. A possession later, Tatum sneaked behind Simmons and Smart fed him for a layup that put the Celtics ahead for good with 22 seconds left. Back in the fall, the rookie couldn\u2019t have envisioned having plays drawn up for him late in a playoff game. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect going into the season,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cOur team looked a lot different than it does today. I never would have imagined that would happen.\u201d And when the Celtics announced that Irving would miss the entire postseason, few would have imagined that they would make it to the conference finals . But here they are, and they\u2019re not done yet. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

That Game 4 loss to the Cavaliers ended the Raptors\u2019 series in the Eastern Conference semifinals , halting hopes of a run to The Finals. A day later, Toronto\u2019s players tried to make sense of it all, with All-Star guard Kyle Lowry calling 2017-18 a \u201cwasted year\u201d for failing to reach the championship stage. Raptors coach Dwane Casey has overseen Toronto\u2019s string of five straight playoff trips and was today named the NBCA Coach of the Year by a panel of his peers . But that success didn\u2019t quiet talk that perhaps Casey could be on his way out in Toronto after the team\u2019s loss to Cleveland. This afternoon, Casey and Toronto GM Masai Ujiri both met with reporters to discuss the team\u2019s playoff exit, the outlook for the team and, in the case of Casey, their future there, too. While he did not receive an official endorsement from Ujiri on his future with the Raptors, Casey sounded confident Wednesday that he is still a part of the future with the Raptors. \u201cNobody has told me differently,\u201d he told reporters when asked about his future with Toronto. \u201cUntil then I\u2019m here still fighting. I\u2019m still here. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a vote of confidence [from Ujiri] \u2026 I\u2019ve read all the articles, texts, all this stuff. I understand what\u2019s been said. I\u2019m not in the dark, but I\u2019m not looking for a vote of confidence because I haven\u2019t heard anything different.\u201d Casey also said he recognizes how the criticism falls on him after the type of series Toronto endured. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy. I\u2019ve been through it. I know what we\u2019ve accomplished and how the basketball world respects what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s part of the territory. I accept it. I\u2019m not running from it. \u2026 I\u2019m an easy target \u2026 I don\u2019t feel sorry for myself, let\u2019s put it that way. \u201d Ujiri said he plans to look at the roster and team as a whole and make assessments as to the future of it. In short, the next steps for the team at large is entering an evaluation process, Ujiri said, which will take place in the coming weeks. \u201cWe are absolutely disappointed with the ending of the season,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cI think our guys are tough enough. They\u2019ve fought through it. To win in this league, you have to go through different stages \u2026 You build from that experience. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not doomsday. Where our program is, it\u2019s not doomsday.\u201d As for Casey, Ujiri praised what the coach has accomplished during his tenure in Toronto and said the two men met and talked for two hours on Wednesday morning. \u201cI believe in Dwane Casey, I believe in the work he\u2019s done, it\u2019s not different than anything I\u2019ve said last year,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at everything, negative and positive and how it all comes together.\u201d One thing Ujiri made clear is that the Raptors will not be looking to tank in 2018-19. \u201cTanking? We\u2019re not doing that here,\u201d Ujiri said. Casey has coached Toronto since 2011, leading the team to five straight playoff appearances and three consecutive 50-win seasons. The Raptors have set franchise-record win totals in three of the past four years and finished atop the East for the first time this year. Toronto\u2019s deepest playoff run came in 2016 when it lost to the eventual-champion Cavaliers in a six-game Eastern Conference finals. After a franchise-record 59 wins in 2017-18, good for the top seed in the Eastern Conference, the loss to the Cavs was as tough a defeat as All-Star DeMar DeRozan has endured. \u201cThis is probably the toughest, most frustrating, difficult, lowest feeling I\u2019ve had,\u201d DeRozan said Tuesday. \u201cYou get to that point where you\u2019re standing firm through everything and you feel like you can\u2019t get knocked down again, and you realize you do get knocked back down again. It\u2019s kind of the worst feeling.\u201d \u201cWe felt like we could possibly make the NBA Finals,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cThat was our goal.\u201d The series slipped away after a Game 1 loss in which the Raptors coughed up a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, missed multiple potential winning baskets, and lost 113-112 in overtime. Toronto nearly rallied to win Game 3, but James banked in a remarkable tie-breaking basket at the buzzer. Neither Lowry nor DeRozan directly endorsed Casey on Tuesday, but both spoke glowingly about their coach. \u201cAll of my success, I have to credit Casey,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m always going to have the utmost respect when it comes to coach Casey.\u201d Lowry acknowledged he and Casey have clashed over the years, but said he\u2019s \u201calways believed in him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best coaches out there,\u201d Lowry said.

Come on; that\u2019s a no-brainer and would go a long way to resuscitating one of the great franchises in league history, which has fallen on very hard times of late. Ayton would give Devin Booker a legit running mate for a decade and give new coach Igor Kokoskov roster structure around which to begin re-buidling the team.

It\u2019s a natural fit in more ways than one for a team that is tender on the inside John Schuhmann :  Memphis Grizzlies. Luka Doncic. The Grizz have two solid veterans to rely on right now, but their collection of young players is pretty uninspiring.

Sekou Smith :  New York wins the lottery and shocks the system by selecting Luka Doncic instead of DeAndre Ayton with that No. 1 overall pick.

The failure against Cleveland was so complete and such a disappointment, I\u2019m sure, to everyone in the organization. The easy move would be to dismiss Dwane Casey, but that doesn\u2019t mean it would be right. Did he make DeMar DeRozan basically disappear (66 shots to score 67 points in four games)? Your best player has to be great at this time of year; DeRozan was, decidedly, not great against the Cavs. Serge Ibaka was a non-factor and, ultimately, benched. Do the Raptors need to hear a new voice after seven years of Casey\u2019s? GM Masai Ujiri knows his team much better than I do and only he can answer that thoroughly. But what Cleveland did to Toronto wasn\u2019t just about Xs and Os; James owns the Raptors mentally and emotionally, just as Michael Jordan owned good Cavaliers and Hawks teams in the playoffs back in the day. It is up to Ujiri to decide whether that\u2019s acceptable, because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s correctable. Steve Aschburner :  Back to the drawing board? Actually, I\u2019m not recommending a complete overhaul. That\u2019s neither practical nor necessary. And let\u2019s face it, a lot of us were complicit in the misguided notion that the legitimate changes coach Dwane Casey and his staff made in the Raptors\u2019 strategies \u2014 which led to their great regular-season success \u2014 would translate not just to the playoffs but to a showdown with LeBron. A deep bench, for instance, loses value when everyone else\u2019s bench gets shortened. The Raptors covered James with length and quickness, but lacked strength and toughness, so there\u2019s a box in need of checking. Here\u2019s another: Split up DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry with a blockbuster trade. Not to worry, their friendship will endure, but Toronto needs a fresh dynamic. Shaun Powell :  You mean, other than home? Well, I wouldn\u2019t say back to the drawing board, because it would be a mistake to overreact to getting swept. The Raptors should just allow internal growth to happen; their young players will only learn from this. And next time, try double teaming LeBron. Goodness. John Schuhmann :  They should explore their options, but they shouldn\u2019t make changes just for the sake of change. Championships aren\u2019t the only thing that defines success in this league, there are a lot of teams that would love to be where the Raptors are, and the development of their young guys (OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam, in particular) offers the possibility of being a better team next season, even if they stand pat. Of course, they do need to figure out why they had such a hard time defending the league\u2019s best offenses this season. Sekou Smith :  The Raptors need to thumb through the Toronto yellow pages and find a good brain doctor to help them get over this LeBron complex they have developed. It\u2019s gotten silly, the power he wields over that group. I also think that now is the right time to assess the composition of that roster and decide if it\u2019s time to make significant changes at the top of the food chain. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan are all stars, fantastic players and leaders in Toronto\u2019s locker room. But if they consistently come up short in the playoffs year after year, it\u2019s GM Masai Ujiri\u2019s responsibility to at least consider his options regarding those two. Hard choices are in order when you fall flat at the most important times of the season year after year."},{"id":40568,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-will-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-keep-rolling-east-playoffs","date":"2018-05-09","title":"Blogtable: Will LeBron James win his 24th straight Eastern Conference playoffs series?","content":"* * * LeBron James has won 23 consecutive Eastern Conference playoffs series.

Terry Rozier has been a revelation at point guard in the playoffs and he\u2019ll cause the Cavs problems; his matchup with George Hill will be a huge factor in the series. If the Celtics can get Jaylen Brown through the rest of the Sixers\u2019 series without him aggravating his hamstring, three potential days off before the conference finals could be big. I just think Boston is much more dynamic offensively this year than at this time last year, when Isaiah Thomas was hobbling. Having said all that, seeing J.R. Smith and George Hill show signs of life in the Toronto series and seeing Kevin Love really get rolling the last three games against the Raptors means James should have enough help to make it 24 out of 24. Steve Aschburner :  Not anymore. There were reasons he might not have won No. 22: the Cavaliers weren\u2019t playing well as the regular season ended and the Indiana Pacers came into the first round with no fear, no intimidation and both the game plan and the personnel to give Cleveland fits. James & Co. survived, but that series \u2013 the fatigue of it, the lack of preparation for their next opponent \u2013 became the reason they would fall in No. 23. Didn\u2019t happen. Not even close. The Cavs have plugged leaks and polished their act into something close to Finals-worthy, and that will continue against either of the two, young, vulnerable teams on the other side of the East bracket. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019ll be a surprise if he doesn\u2019t win 24. This isn\u2019t to take away from the gutsy Celtics or upstart Sixers, whomever will be standing in LeBron James\u2019 way next. But this might be the weakest Eastern playoff field LeBron has ever seen, given that he went through (a) the post-Paul George Indiana Pacers and (b) the mentally-flawed Toronto Raptors and will then see (c) the Celtics without Kyrie Irving or the Sixers will a bunch of kids. Also, the Cavs are finally hitting their stride right about now. John Schuhmann :  There are certainly reasons to believe that Boston has a chance. (With apologies to Philadelphia, I\u2019m assuming the Sixers don\u2019t make history by coming back from a 3-0 deficit.) The Celtics had the No. 1 defense in the league and have the size on the perimeter to defend LeBron James and stay at home on the Cavs\u2019 shooters a lot better than Toronto did. The Celtics have been the better, more consistent and more resilient team than the Cavs ( who have won just two playoff games by more than four points ), and Al Horford has been the second best player in the Eastern Conference playoffs. They will be able to take advantage of some matchups on their end of the floor, though they might not have the overall firepower to keep up with the Cavs if James\u2019 teammates can provide some support. And of course, it remains difficult to pick against James before he reaches The Finals.  Sekou Smith :  There\u2019s no reason to believe in anything other than the power of LeBron. He\u2019s shown us enough the past 15 years \u2014 and the last eight in particular \u2014 that when it comes to the race for the Eastern Conference title, he\u2019s the one thing we can count on. Boston and Philadelphia pose much different problems for the Cavaliers compared to the Toronto Raptors, so LeBron and Co. shouldn\u2019t go into this next round overconfident. But they should be secure in the fact that the one, true difference-maker in this whole thing still resides in northeast Ohio. Until that changes, it\u2019s wise to bet on LeBron.

Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award, the National Basketball Coaches Association announced today. The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award recognizes the dedication, commitment, and hard work of NBA Head Coaches and is presented annually to a Head Coach who helps guide his players to a higher level of performance on the court and shows outstanding service and dedication to the community off the court. It honors the spirit of Michael H. Goldberg who set the standard for loyalty, integrity, love of the game, passionate representation and tireless promotion of NBA coaching. It is unique in that it is the only award voted upon by the winners\u2019 peers, the Head Coaches of all 30 NBA teams. The voting for this year\u2019s award once again illustrates the depth of coaching excellence in the NBA, as 8 of the 30 Head Coaches received votes. In addition to Casey, the following Coaches also received votes: Brett Brown, Mike D\u2019Antoni, Nate McMillan, Gregg Popovich, Doc Rivers, Quin Snyder and Terry Stotts. \u201cThe Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award for the top NBA Coach as voted by his peers is one of the most meaningful in all of pro sports,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks Head Coach and National Basketball Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle. \u201cDwane Casey once again maximized the Toronto roster to achieve the top record in the Eastern Conference. Congratulations to Dwane on this prestigious recognition.\u201d Coach Dwane Casey guided the Toronto Raptors to a highly successful regular season. They finished the 2017-18 season with a franchise record 59 wins, the team\u2019s fifth Atlantic Division title and the best record in the Eastern Conference for the first time in franchise history. Last summer, despite having won 51 and 56 games the prior two seasons, Casey revamped Toronto\u2019s highly rated offense. Dwane got the Raptors to buy into the new focus which featured a faster pace of play, less dribbling, more passing and an emphasis on 3-point, not mid-range, shooting. The result: a record 59-win season and a renewed sense of team purpose. Casey, the winningest Coach in Raptors history, and his staff were the Eastern Conference Coaches at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles. \u201cTo be honored by your peers is incredibly gratifying, and I am so thankful to my colleagues across the league for this recognition. I\u2019m also grateful to the talented and dedicated coaching staff I work with every day in Toronto,\u201d said Toronto Raptors Head Coach Dwane Casey. \u201cTo be recognized with an award that bears Michael H. Goldberg\u2019s name is very special.\u201d The National Basketball Coaches Association, and its entire membership, congratulates Coach Casey on his impressive season. The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award trophy will be presented to him at the NBCA Annual Meeting of Head Coaches in September. \u201cI had the good fortune of working alongside Michael H. Goldberg each and every day. Michael was incredibly generous with his wisdom, advice, guidance, and time,\u201d said David S. Fogel, NBCA Executive Director.  \u201cThe Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award is presented each year to the Head Coach who exemplifies the same high level of integrity and excellence that Michael displayed during his highly successful career. Coach Casey exemplifies these values on and off the court, and his tireless work ethic led to the most successful season in Raptors franchise history. Congratulations to Coach Casey and the entire Raptors Coaching Staff, this honor is well deserved.\u201d The Michael H. Goldberg NBCA Coach of the Year Award is named after the esteemed long-time Executive Director of the National Basketball Coaches Association. The NBCA encompasses all Head and Assistant Coaches in the NBA, and its alumni. In 1980, just four years after the NBCA was founded, Michael H. Goldberg became its first Executive Director. Building on the existing foundation of the NBCA, he guided it during the years of the greatest growth in professional basketball. He helped gain significant benefits for NBA Coaches, including increased retirement funds and disability insurance. Prior to the NBCA, Goldberg was General Counsel of the American Basketball Association. The recipients of the inaugural award, presented in 2017, were Coaches Mike D\u2019Antoni and Erik Spoelstra. The NBA will announce the winner of the Red Auerbach Trophy as the NBA\u2019s Coach of the Year Award on June 25 at the second annual NBA Awards Show live from Los Angeles on TNT at 9 pm ET ."},{"id":40573,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-eliminate-new-orleans-pelicans-head-west-finals","date":"2018-05-09","title":"Golden State Warriors show their dominant side in Game 5 series-clincher","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 It was just before 9 p.m. local time Tuesday when the defending champs, after searching for incentive and not always finding any over the last six months, finally announced they are done playing games. It was time to play for something bigger, and soon enough, against someone claiming to be better. There was Klay Thompson splashing in a 19-foot pullup. Kevin Durant followed with a mid-range jumper. Stephen Curry flipped a finger roll. On a fast break, Curry drove for an apparent layup, then quickly fed Durant for a dunk. Durant hit a 3-pointer. Thompson got a steal. Curry nailed a 3-pointer. A Draymond Green dunk \u2014 and a scream afterward. That\u2019s how the Golden State Warriors bid farewell to the New Orleans Pelicans, with a second-half bum-rush in a 113-104 win in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals . And that\u2019s how they plan to say hello to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals ( aka the People\u2019s Choice Series ). \u201cI think it\u2019ll be entertaining,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. \u201cI think people will have a fun time watching that series.\u201d The Warriors, now woke? It certainly seems that way, feels that way, looks that way. And for their sake, it better be that way. The Rockets, based on the way they seared through the season, are bringing a level of Western Conference heat perhaps unseen by the Warriors in the Steve Kerr era. The Warriors are evidently aware of what lies ahead in their fourth straight conference finals because all the boxes are checking off \u2014 and just in time. There\u2019s no longer any need to be uninspired. The days and nights of lapses and losing to lesser teams, which happened often following the All-Star break, are almost forgotten. Their concentration, motivation and antennae are all up, along with their most important vital signs. Curry is feeling it \u2014 as in his jumper and his wind (and not his knee). He played 37 minutes in Game 5, his most in the playoffs and highest total since a Feb. 22 win against the LA Clippers . It serves of evidence that his recovery and conditioning following his MCL sprain are roughly back to normal. Oh, and he was doing Steph things Tuesday, shooting deeper and deepest, dropping in 28 points \u2014 many of which came in a mad rush. \u201cI think he\u2019s OK,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s back now.\u201d Curry is encouraged by how his body is responding to increased minutes and the intensity of the playoffs. He said he suspects it will all come together in time for the Rockets series and his matchup with Chris Paul. \u201cI feel good and I feel confident in what I\u2019m able to do out there,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI continue to get better, continue to get my timing right and continue to get back to normal. Hopefully I won\u2019t look back.\u201d Green is all over the floor as he became the first in club history to average a triple-double in a playoff series (14.8 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 10 apg). And, if necessary, that includes the other team\u2019s huddle. Green eavesdropped, uninvited of course, in the Pelicans\u2019 group in the first quarter and caused a stir, as only Draymond can. His gamesmanship will certainly carry over to some degree in the next round. It\u2019ll be up to the Rockets how they respond to being poked if not provoked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call them antics,\u201d Durant said, \u201cjust his passion for competing, it shines bright. It\u2019s pretty cool and pretty fun to see.\u201d Kerr said: \u201cDraymond was amazing the whole series. Obviously he\u2019s such a valuable player for us. The perfect modern NBA player. He can guard anybody, step out and hit threes. This is what the NBA has become and we\u2019re lucky to have him.\u201d Durant is averaging 28 points and eight rebounds in the playoffs and took up the load in Curry\u2019s absence. His connection with Curry \u2014 and his ability to take over or yield to Curry when the time suits it \u2014 works in his and the Warriors\u2019 favor. Aside from a 4-for-20 showing in Game 3 of this series , Thompson was on target. He took advantage of open looks and gave scoring balance to Curry and Durant, scoring 22 or more in four of the five games. Thompson will get first crack at James Harden, this after coming off a Game 5 in which he held Rajon Rondo to seven points and seven assists (before Rondo suffered a sore groin and sat much of the fourth quarter). Andre Iguodala left his fingerprints all over the Pelicans, too. He was guarding every position and even playing point guard for the first two games of the series. He\u2019ll be called upon to do much of the same against the Rockets and could also see time against Harden. \u201cI told Andre if there was a game where you were underpaid, this was it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhen Andre\u2019s on the floor, it\u2019s like the babysitter\u2019s there and everything is fine.\u201d There\u2019s also a touch of Quin Cook and Kevon Looney, two bench players who played sparingly the last two postseasons but are now key in Kerr\u2019s rotation. Reaching the West finals doesn\u2019t get old, they say, but it is becoming routine. The Warriors are 10-2 in these playoffs and used a 25-4 sprint in the third quarter of Game 5 \u2014 a span of only 5 1\/2 minutes \u2014 to flip everyone\u2019s attention to the West finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird deal because we haven\u2019t played them in so long,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re a great team, we know they\u2019re ready and we\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d The Rockets took two of the three matchups with the Warriors this season, but none of those games featured both teams at full strength. Houston has home-court advantage throughout the playoffs and made that a priority down the stretch of 2017-18 as starters burned heavy playing time in early April. Houston re-tooled last summer with beating the Warriors in mind, most vividly by trading for Paul to give Harden a dangerous tag-team partner. Paul scored 41 to fuel the Rockets\u2019 Game 5 elimination of the Utah Jazz in the other West semis. Harden has pole position on for the Kia MVP award. Capela is in the running for the Kia Most Improved Player award. From the front office to the last man on the bench, the Rockets had Golden State on the brain and made no secret of that. It\u2019s all amusing to the Warriors and especially to Green, who said the Rockets are merely the next team up. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter to us who we play,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever we got them, we got them. It makes no sense for us to run around saying we want them like they want us. We ain\u2019t running around talking about, \u2018Man I can\u2019t wait, we want them bad.\u2019 We have a goal. Whoever\u2019s in the way of that goal, that\u2019s who we get. We want a championship bad. That\u2019s the truth. \u201cAll that talk \u2026 you gotta play the game now. That\u2019s all fine and dandy in January. Now they got us, we got them. Got to go out and play. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s better. They have made it know their team is built to beat us. It\u2019s kind of their obsession or whatever. All that stuff is cool. All understandable. It\u2019s time to play.\u201d Yes, time for Golden State to stop playing games and start playing for championships. First up, the conference title, a familiar flag for them. It\u2019s that time of year again for the Warriors, healthy and inspired. They\u2019re back at the brink, back in their own skin. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The series the NBA world has been waiting for from the moment Chris Paul requested a trade last summer that sent him to the Houston Rockets to join forces with James Harden has arrived. It\u2019s the Rockets vs. the four-time Western Conference and two-time NBA champion Golden State Warriors for West supremacy. The Rockets had a feeling they could see this journey through to this point, even when the teams met on opening night at Oracle Arena . Houston was built to beat the champs, and did it twice in their three regular season encounters. Rockets center Clint Capela voiced his opinions on the matchup after a January win, saying his team was superior to the champs . And he \u2019 s just as eager for this match up, in which the Rockets hold home-court advantage. \u201c I \u2019 m real excited, \u201d Capela said. \u201c This (Warriors) team is going to be hard, it \u2019 s going to be a fight. There \u2019 s going to be a lot of adjustments after every game. It \u2019 s going to be a chess game. Of course, we \u2019 re going to be ready. They \u2019 ve been to The Finals three straight years. So we \u2019 re just excited. Everybody\u2019s excited about it. I \u2019 m sure all the NBA fans are excited about it, too.\u201d The Warriors are fired up, too, and have heard all the chirping. \u201c Now you \u2019 ve got to play the game, \u201d All-Star forward Draymond Green said. \u201c You wanted us, now you \u2019 ve got us. \u201d The Warriors are attempting to conquer the West for a fourth straight season, but this will be their first West finals without home-court advantage. Doing it against a team specifically designed to take them down just adds to a battle wrought with connections. Harden, Paul, Green, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson all won gold medals together, be it on the Olympic or World Cup of Basketball stage. Harden and Durant were teammates on the Oklahoma City Thunder team that lost The Finals in 2012 . Paul \u2019 s LA Clippers squad in 2014 was the last West foe to knock the Warriors out of the playoffs before The Finals. And the Rockets were the team the Warriors beat in the 2015 West finals to jump-start their would-be dynasty. Rockets coach Mike D \u2019Antoni pioneered the style the Warriors have used to dominate the league while he was coaching in Phoenix, where Warriors coach Steve Kerr was the Suns GM. The 3-pointers will fly from all directions. Both teams are capable of defending at a championship level. The personnel on both sides is ideally matched. Perhaps best of all, though, is that both teams are healthy and without any ready-made excuses overshadowing this showdown. It \u2019 s best on best, a test of collective wills between the \u201c cream of the Western Conference crop, \u201d as Curry declared after the Warriors and Rockets each won their West semifinal series just hours apart on May 8. The NBA world has been waiting on this heavyweight showdown. Now, it \u2019 s finally here. 100.7 \u2014  The two best offensive teams in the regular season have been the two best defensive teams in the playoffs , combining to allow just 100.7 points per 100 possessions on their way to the conference finals. In the first round, the Rockets and Warriors held the Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs to 5.6 and 5.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they scored in the regular season, respectively. And in the conference semifinals, they held the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans to 7.0 and 16.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than they scored in the first round, respectively. The Rockets\u2019 starting lineup has allowed just 92 points per 100 possessions in its 153 minutes , having forced more than 21 turnovers per 100 ( the best mark among lineups that have played at least 75 minutes ). The Warriors\u2019 \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup, meanwhile, has allowed less than 87 points per 100 possessions in its 54 minutes , and the champs have allowed just 94 points per 100 possessions in 250 total minutes with Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala on the floor together . These teams aren\u2019t just here because of how potent their offenses are, and the team that advances to The Finals will be the one that continues to defend at a high level. \u2014 John Schuhmann The Rockets made it their mission to put together a group to avenge their 2015 and 2016 playoff failures, with the Warriors serving as their primary target. They \u2019 ve got home-court advantage, an inspired Paul and what appears to be all of the requisite parts needed to interrupt the Warriors \u2019 dynasty plans. But do they have the nerve to snatch it all from Golden State, which took a measured approach to 2017-18 and has seemingly flipped the proverbial with another championship run on the line? Experience over ambition this time. Warriors in 6. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Hey, there\u2019s Kevin Hart ! Look, it\u2019s Questlove! Wait, is that really Dr. Oz? But there\u2019s one VIP that the 45-year old billionaire co-owner of the Sixers really wants to introduce. \u201cHey, have you met Meek?\u201d Rubin asks. Meek Mill is all smiles as he says life is all good in the days since he was released from prison while the Philly-born rapper appeals decade-old gun and drug convictions. Mill had a string of high-profile names \u2014 including Hart , rapper Jay-Z and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft \u2014 support him during a five-month campaign to be freed on bail from prison for probation violations. But Mill\u2019s biggest advocate, one of his closest friends and the e-commerce entrepreneur who arranged for a helicopter to take Mill from prison to a Sixers\u2019 playoff game is Rubin, majority owner and CEO of Kynetic, the holding company for sportswear giant Fanatics. His biggest behind-the-scenes role of late was his drive to free Mill from potentially years behind bars. \u201cHe\u2019s been showing up for me and standing up for me like a real friend would do,\u201d Mill told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s meant a lot for our friendship and brought us closer together. I just think he\u2019s a good-hearted person being that he\u2019s somebody worth billions of dollars and still uses his resources to stand up for people who don\u2019t have the money to be able to fight the errors of the criminal justice system.\u201d Forbes lists Rubin\u2019s net worth at $3 billion. TMZ counts his value in page views \u2014 yes, that\u2019s Rubin in the photo partying at a birthday bash for 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid. But Rubin says he\u2019ll find personal worth in the months ahead teaming with Mill to tackle thorny criminal justice issues. It could help that Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is a frequent front-row companion of Rubin and Mill\u2019s during Philly\u2019s run through the postseason. The trio recently appeared together to ask state lawmakers for criminal justice changes . \u201cThis was one of my closest friends and I watched something terrible happen to him,\u201d Rubin said at his Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, office. \u201cIt started with, how do we fix the situation with him? I said, \u2018My God, this is horrific.\u2019 What it actually showed me was, there are much bigger problems with the criminal justice system which I had no understanding of. We\u2019re not going to let what happened to Meek Mill happen to everyday Meek Mills.\u201d Rubin wasn\u2019t expecting a personal awakening when he met Mill at the 2015 NBA All-Star Game in New York. Rubin, raised in an upper middle-class Philly suburb, was simply a businessman who had been making deals since he was a kid. He owned a ski shop as a teen, dropped out of Villanova after just six weeks and sold his first sports equipment business to eBay in 2011 for $2.4 billion. He runs Fanatics, fashion site Rue La La and shipping site Shop Runner through Kynetic. And in 2011, he joined an ownership group led by Joshua Harris and David Blitzer that would buy the 76ers and later the NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils. Harris and Blitzer \u2014 who have since formed Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment as they expand their sports portfolio \u2014 had served as the primary faces of the sports teams since their purchases. But over the last two years as his wealth seemed to match his ambition, Rubin has been at the forefront of the Sixers\u2019 rise from the 10-win early Process days into one of the best young teams in the NBA. The seats that flank Rubin \u2014 Mill and fellow rapper Lil Uzi Vert had the distinction at Game 4 against the Celtics on Monday \u2014 have become must-see for fans to catch celeb sightings. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal to have this many people support me at one time,\u201d Mill said. \u201cThe feeling is unexplainable.\u201d The man who pushed Mill\u2019s cause \u2014 and helped keep the \u201cDreams and Nightmares\u201d performer\u2019s spirits high in prison with visits from a few 76ers \u2014 is also getting his time in the spotlight. \u201cHe freed Meek! He freed Meek!\u201d one man yelled, trying to get Rubin\u2019s attention. It\u2019s not just rappers and actors \u2014 or even Game 4 guest, CNBC news anchor Joe Kernen \u2014 that flock to Rubin. Rubin and Embiid have become tight and it was the owner who arranged Embiid\u2019s birthday party in Miami and snagged a suite for the organization to attend a World Series game in Houston at the same time the Sixers were in town. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in the basketball decisions,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious from the outside in that I\u2019ve got great relations with them. I\u2019m a very player-oriented owner. I think I\u2019m highly relatable to these guys. I\u2019m in the business. There are things I can have a big influence in with them.\u201d Rubin, divorced with a 12-year-old daughter, has an off-the-cuff Mark Cuban vibe and wears the same blue button-down, jeans and black sneaks to Game 4 that he did hours earlier inside an office filled with photos of other celebs and his appearance on \u201cUndercover Boss .\u201d He even hit up baseball\u2019s All-Star Game last year with Kraft and Embiid . \u201cBy the way, Joel and Robert love each other. Meek and Robert love each other,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cI love to be able to foster those relationships. People always say to me how lucky Meek is to have me. Actually, I think I\u2019m so lucky to have him. He\u2019s opened my eyes to so many things that I would have never understood had it not been for him.\u201d Rubin recently spearheaded a bid to buy the Charlotte Panthers before he dropped out of contention and he has sights set on NFL ownership. Until then, he might dangle his A-list connections to help recruit prized free agents \u2014 like, say LeBron James \u2014 this summer to join Embiid and Ben Simmons. But it\u2019s more than hip-hop and hoops that connects Rubin and Mill these days. It\u2019s an unwavering desire to speak out in the national spotlight for reform. Rubin said he and Mill were close to announcing a foundation \u2014 with A-listers pledging to assist, of course \u2014 that would include a wish list of initiatives. \u201cWe want to help people that\u2019s not like myself who don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d Mill said."},{"id":46897,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-call-missing-2018-finals-wasted-year-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry","date":"2018-05-09","title":"Kyle Lowry: Toronto Raptors' record season a 'wasted year' after early playoffs exit","content":" TORONTO \u2014 To DeMar DeRozan, regular-season and playoff basketball are as different as checkers and chess.

After a franchise-record 59 wins, good for the top seed in the Eastern Conference, it was as tough a defeat as DeRozan has endured. \u201cThis is probably the toughest, most frustrating, difficult, lowest feeling I\u2019ve had,\u201d DeRozan said Tuesday. \u201cYou get to that point where you\u2019re standing firm through everything and you feel like you can\u2019t get knocked down again, and you realize you do get knocked back down again. It\u2019s kind of the worst feeling.\u201d Teammate Kyle Lowry was equally gloomy, calling it a \u201cwasted year\u201d in spite of Toronto\u2019s historic achievements. \u201cWe felt like we could possibly make the NBA Finals,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cThat was our goal.\u201d The series slipped away after a Game 1 loss in which the Raptors coughed up a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, missed multiple potential winning baskets, and lost 113-112 in overtime. Toronto nearly rallied to win Game 3, but James banked in a remarkable tie-breaking basket at the buzzer. \u201cThere was opportunity there, we just didn\u2019t seize it,\u201d guard Fred VanVleet said. \u201cThese playoffs will be in the back of our minds all summer.\u201d Casey has coached Toronto since 2011, leading the team to five straight playoff appearances and three consecutive 50-win seasons. The Raptors have set franchise-record win totals in three of the past four years and finished atop the East for the first time this year. Toronto\u2019s deepest playoff run came in 2016 when it lost to the eventual-champion Cavaliers in a six-game Eastern Conference Finals. Neither Casey nor team president Masai Ujiri spoke to reporters Tuesday. Ujiri is expected to speak later this week, but no date has been set. On Monday, Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said it would be \u201cabsurd\u201d for the Raptors to fire Casey. Neither Lowry nor DeRozan directly endorsed Casey on Tuesday, but both spoke glowingly about their coach. \u201cAll of my success, I have to credit Casey,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m always going to have the utmost respect when it comes to coach Casey.\u201d Lowry acknowledged he and Casey have clashed over the years, but said he\u2019s \u201calways believed in him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best coaches out there,\u201d Lowry said. Lowry said he was frustrated the Raptors let the Cavs get \u201cway too comfortable\u201d after Cleveland entered the second round worn down by a tough, seven-game series against Indiana. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to be as physical as we needed to be,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWe did a great job in the regular season, but playoffs are just different.\u201d James is different, too, a generational talent who has represented the Eastern Conference in seven straight NBA Finals and is now one round away from reaching his eighth. Lowry called LeBron \u201cone of the greatest players to ever play the game.\u201d Despite his disappointment, DeRozan said he won\u2019t shy away from the challenge of facing James. \u201cAs a competitor, we want to go up against that because the story is sweeter once you dethrone a great,\u201d DeRozan said. Unfortunately for the Raptors, they\u2019re still looking for a way to unseat King James. Here are some other things to watch as the offseason begins: BENCHED Toronto\u2019s deep bench was held in check by Cleveland, which made sure to match LeBron against the Raptors\u2019 reserves. \u201cWe pretty much shredded almost every bench in the NBA throughout the regular season,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t get it done in the playoffs. Kind of true to our team in terms of underperforming when it mattered the most.\u201d PAINFUL PLAYOFFS VanVleet, who injured his right shoulder in the regular-season finale and missed most of the first round, admitted he dealt with lingering pain throughout the playoffs. \u201cI\u2019ve been lying to myself for the last two, three weeks just because I had plans on playing into June,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cIt was something I just got accustomed to.\u201d VanVleet plans to visit a specialist in New York City within the next week to ensure his playoff minutes didn\u2019t cause further damage to his shoulder. FRED\u2019S FUTURE A restricted free agent this summer, VanVleet said he\u2019d be happy to remain a Raptor. \u201cI love it here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the place that gave me a chance, gave me an opportunity. I\u2019m a loyal guy, I always have been. Hopefully things work out.\u201d"},{"id":46867,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-utah-jazz-chris-paul-delivers-game-5","date":"2018-05-09","title":"Chris Paul boosts Houston Rockets into Western Conference finals with big night","content":"HOUSTON \u2014 This is James Harden\u2019s team. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But on this night, for this moment, the Houston Rockets\u2019 Kia MVP frontrunner had to step aside for Chris Paul. Those \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants the Toyota Center crowd usually reserve for Harden were chants of \u201cC-P-3\u201d in the final moments of the Rockets\u2019 112-102 Game 5 win over the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference semifinals. It was an appropriate end to a career playoff-best night for Paul, the same night he finally erased that black mark on his resume, the night he finally carried his team to the place he\u2019s never been. The Rockets will play in the Western Conference finals next week and they can thank their wired-up point guard for pushing them over the top tonight. It was obvious early on that Paul was not going to allow things to go any other way. He\u2019d been here before, up 3-1 and seemingly in total control, only to see his LA Clippers fall to the Rockets in the conference semifinals in 2015. A chance to battle the Golden State Warriors for a right to play for a championship vanished, in an instant. Not this time. Not after all he had to do to make it here again. Not after packing up his life in Los Angeles and relocating here to play alongside Harden and for coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, all three of them carrying playoff demons with them from their respective pasts. And not after he scored 41 points, 20 in the fourth quarter, dished out 10 assists and grabbed seven rebounds without committing a single turnover to beat back the Jazz. He\u2019s the first player in NBA history to record a 40-point, 10-assist night without a turnover since turnovers became an official statistic in the 1977-78 season. \u201cHis performance tonight was off the charts,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t happen for a better guy. He\u2019s been working all year for this. We\u2019re halfway home and we know we haven\u2019t done anything yet, but this was huge for us.\u201d Huge for the Rockets, but particularly huge for Paul, whose trade request at the end of last season in Los Angeles shocked the basketball world. He could have stayed with the Clippers and kept trying to break through there. But he recognized that time was up on that group and risked his reputation, betting everything on he and Harden becoming an instant hit as the best point guard duo in basketball. Sacrifices had to be made and comfort zones disrupted. If it went wrong, there would only be one of two places to point to as the main culprits. That might explain Paul\u2019s ambivalence while trying to sum up his magical night. \u201cI don\u2019t know, is that what you play for?\u201d he said after joining Michael Jordan (1998) as the only players in playoff history to record a 40\/10 game in a series-clincher. \u201cFor us, like we said before the game and every game, they\u2019re in our way.\u201d Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell was definitely in the way. He did his best to spoil things for Paul and the Rockets with a nuclear performance after halftime. He scored 22 points in the final eight minutes of the third quarter to push the Jazz ahead 80-75 and silence the crowd. He forced Paul to get up off the baseline, where he was trying to catch a rest, and get back to work to make sure the Rockets delivered on their season-long promise to themselves to have the opportunity to play their way into The Finals. When Mitchell injured his left foot with 7:09 to play the Rockets were clinging to a five-point lead. Had he returned, he might have had something to say about the finish. But he didn\u2019t after being ruled out for the remainder of the game with foot soreness. Paul made sure that no one else could steal the show from him down the stretch. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Harden said of Paul\u2019s virtuoso performance. \u201cHe took over the game. He put us on his back and said, \u2018listen, I got us.\u2019 That\u2019s big time, a big-time performance. He got in his bag and he called everybody off. He said, \u2018you get out the way.\u2019 He had that look in his eyes. I don\u2019t care what you say, if he has that look in his eyes every single night, he\u2019s a problem.\u201d Paul was a gigantic problem for the Jazz with the game on the line. He drained a 24-footer for a 97-96 Rockets lead with 4:09 to play, a 19-foot jumper with 3:18 to play, a 28-footer off the glass with 2:30 left and finally a pull-up jumper with 1:57 left for a 107-98 lead that all but put the game away. He found P.J. Tucker in the corner for a 3-pointer with 35 seconds left, pushing the lead to 10 and his two free throws with 26.4 seconds to play were the Rockets\u2019 last. It was a fitting end for the man who chased away at least one ghost on this night. Anyone crazy enough to question his mettle now need only run back the film of his historic night. \u201cThat\u2019s why for I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been in this league, the thing with him being the best point guard in the league, the things he does,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, \u201che just wields us to win. Even the bank shot, I mean, give me a break. That\u2019s just people trying to find a way. I had to keep him out there, I usually give him a rest for a couple of minutes. I didn\u2019t do that with James being sick a little bit.\u201d Tucker, another member of the newly assembled Rockets, saved some of his best work for this night as well. A defensive stopper by trade, he lit up the Jazz for a career playoff-high 19 points of his own, making seven of his nine shots and going 5-for-7 from beyond the 3-point line. Another newcomer, Luc Mbah a Moute, contributed eight points and Gerald Green, the Houston native who was signed off the street and didn\u2019t play his first game until three days after Christmas, added eight timely points of his own off the bench during that wild second half back and forth. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun,\u201d Paul said of this ride with this group, Tucker in particular, since they\u2019ve known each other since they were 10 and competing on the AAU circuit. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the points or anything like that. It\u2019s about how we built it, too.\u201d It started with a vision last summer, Harden said. Paul was, of course, the first piece. So no, he wasn\u2019t surprised to see Paul do what he did Tuesday night, or what Tucker, Mbah a Moute, Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, Green or Clint Capela did at times throughout this series or a regular season that saw the Rockets blitz their way to the best record in the league, a franchise-best 65 wins. \u201cWe\u2019re something special,\u201d Tucker said after detailing the way this entire group came together from a summer of seismic moves from Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who put the pieces into place. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re called a team,\u201d Harden said. \u201cEach and every individual has a huge role to play in what we\u2019re trying to do and where we are trying to go \u2026 that\u2019s why they are here. We have to go out there and give our best every night and live with the results. If we give the effort we know we can, it\u2019s pretty tough to beat us.\u201d The next stop is the Western Conference finals where the Warriors, the reigning NBA champs, are waiting after closing out the Pelicans late Tuesday. And that\u2019s where Paul gets to size up and stare down that playoff ghost that\u2019s been haunting him since 2015. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Playing 48 hours after beating the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 7 of the first round, the Celtics had one of their best offensive games of the season against a Philadelphia 76ers team (with a top-three defense) that had five days off after eliminating the Miami Heat in five games. A key to that performance was the Celtics shooting 13-for-24 in the last six seconds of the shot clock . They have players \u2014 Al Horford and Jayson Tatum in particular \u2014 who continually find a way to get a decent shot late in the clock, but that 13-for-24 was unsustainable. Over the last three games, the Celtics have shot just 33 percent (including 9-for-29 from 3-point range) in the last six seconds of the shot clock. And as Sixers coach Brett Brown noted before Game 4 on Monday, his team deserves some credit for forcing the Celtics work late in the clock. League-wide effective field goal percentage goes down with the shot clock, so late-clock shots are generally good for the defense. \u201cI feel like there hasn\u2019t been much to take from us early,\u201d Brown said. It should also be noted that the Celtics had a below-average offense in the regular season and have been without the guy \u2014 Kyrie Irving \u2014 who averaged almost 10 more points per game than anybody else on the roster in the regular season . Irving is obviously Boston\u2019s most dynamic creator off the dribble and his absence has surely been felt as the Celtics have gotten less efficient with each successive game in the conference semis, from 119 points scored per 100 possessions in Game 1 to just 96 in Game 4 . Turnovers were an issue Monday, but the decline has been mostly about the Celtics\u2019 shooting, and mostly about their shooting from beyond the arc. After shooting 32-for-71 (45 percent) from 3-point range in Games 1 and 2, the Celtics shot 21-for-70 (30 percent) from three in Games 3 and 4. The attempts have been there, but the makes have not. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Celtics\u2019 threes were more contested on average in Games 3 and 4 than they were in Games 1 and 2 . But they also just shot worse on 3-pointers tracked as \u201copen\u201d or \u201cwide open.\u201d The Sixers have also done a better job of keeping the Celtics out of the corners. In Games 1 and 2, 21 of Boston\u2019s 71 3-point attempts were from the corners. In Games 3 and 4, only 13 of their 70 threes came from the corners. The Celtics have shot much better on corner threes (47 percent) than on above-the-break threes (33 percent) in the playoffs, so converting a few of the former into the latter is a good thing for the Sixers. Boston hasn\u2019t been getting to the basket as often, either. The restricted area (1.3 points per attempt league-wide in the regular season) and the corners (1.2) are the best places to shoot from, and the Celtics took a much lower percentage of their shots from those areas in Games 3 and 4 (30 percent) than they did in Games 1 and 2 (41 percent). One adjustment that the Sixers have made is keeping Joel Embiid off of Al Horford more often when the Celtics play Horford at center. Over the first two games, Boston scored an amazing 59 points on 37 possessions (1.59 per possession) with Embiid as the primary defender on Horford . In Games 3 and 4, Embiid was the defender on Marcus Morris for more possessions (27) than he was on Horford (18) . That\u2019s a little less stress on the Sixers\u2019 center. The Sixers needed a lineup change to stay alive in Game 4 , but they led by five with less than six minutes to go in Game 2 and led by five again in overtime of Game 3. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in the NBA playoffs, but Philly certainly has the ability to win any given game against the Celtics, who, as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of games, can struggle offensively. Thus far in the postseason, the Celtics have been 11.5 points per 100 possessions better offensively at home (where they\u2019ve scored 111.4) than they\u2019ve been on the road (99.9) . Five of their six best offensive games of the playoffs have come at TD Garden, where they\u2019re 6-0. Returning home for Game 5 on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET, TNT) won\u2019t be a cure-all. No matter where they\u2019re playing, the Celtics need to figure out how to get their offense back on track to advance to the conference finals. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

It can\u2019t hurt that one of them is LeBron James. And while Knicks fans can dream of Fizdale\u2019s relationship with James giving them a shot when the superstar enters free agency as expected, a team building from the bottom can\u2019t focus on one player \u2013 even the best one in the game. New York needed a coach that can bring out the best in everyone on the roster, and that\u2019s what the Knicks believe they have in Fizdale. The Knicks agreed to a deal with the former Memphis Grizzlies coach last week and introduced him Tuesday at a news conference at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI think the big thing that we found \u2014 and that\u2019s obviously terrific that some of the game\u2019s greats recognized David for who he is as a man and as a coach \u2014 but the players that are not that, just the guys 1 through 15, the reviews coming back on him were all very consistently similar,\u201d general manager Scott Perry said. \u201cThat he invested in us, that he\u2019s going to develop you, he\u2019s going to challenge you, he\u2019s going to hold you accountable. And so I think that\u2019s the important thing, that David has shown the ability to relate to a number of players across the board, not just the star players.\u201d Still, Fizdale\u2019s relationship with James gives New Yorkers a slither of hope. Though that hope is based more in fantasy than reality. While James could become a free agent this summer, the Knicks would be unlikely to afford him and even less likely to impress him, given the long climb they face to contention. They have missed the playoffs five straight seasons and will be without All-Star Kristaps Porzingis when the Fizdale era begins as he recovers from a torn left knee ligament. Fizdale said he is only focused for now on who will be playing for him. \u201cI can\u2019t really speak on free agency,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cI just know that if we build this thing right together with the guys we have here, who I\u2019m focused on here, people will want to come.\u201d Fizdale wanted to come, despite how quickly coaches get eaten up in New York. Perry and team president Steve Mills interviewed 10 other candidates during their search, and also spoke with players and executives from around the league to gain information about the men they were considering as the replacement for Jeff Hornacek. One of them was Pat Riley, Fizdale\u2019s boss in Miami when the Heat won two NBA titles while he was an assistant to Erik Spoelstra. Riley had kept in contact with Fizdale after he was fired early last season in Memphis after clashing with star center Marc Gasol. \u201cNo one was more happy when he got the news \u2026 to see one of his guys be here, coming back and doing this and taking this challenge,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cI\u2019m sure right now he\u2019s pretty proud.\u201d Even the failure with Gasol after the Grizzlies had gone to the playoffs in Fizdale\u2019s first season impressed the Knicks during their discussions. Fizdale didn\u2019t hide from his share of the responsibility, acknowledging that maybe he pushed too hard on a team whose window to contend for a title he believed was shrinking. \u201cWhen someone owns an issue like that, we all hit adversity, but it\u2019s how you deal with it and how you learn from it,\u201d Mills said, \u201cand that\u2019s one of the things that really impressed us about David.\u201d Fizdale had spent eight seasons before going to Memphis in Miami, where the Heat reached four straight NBA Finals. Fizdale said his relationship with their stars developed by spending time with them, talking honestly about important things like family matters, and of course by winning championships. The last one will be difficult in New York. He is the 11th Knicks coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. Fizdale said he couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to coach at Madison Square Garden, even though he was a candidate for jobs where there is more stability. \u201cThe risk\/reward thing was, I just said to hell with it,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Knicks, what are we talking about here?\u201d Mills said management will help Fizdale navigate the turbulence, joking that he\u2019s seen not only brush fires but forest fires around the organization. Fizdale isn\u2019t concerned, either by that or the expectations that still surround a team because of the success it had long ago. \u201cI think you\u2019ve either got to go after it or you\u2019re afraid, and I\u2019ve never been afraid,\u201d Fizdale said."},{"id":46818,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/minnesota-timberwolves-coach-rick-brunson-resigns","date":"2018-05-08","title":"Minnesota Timberwolves assistant coach Rick Brunson resigns","content":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota Timberwolves assistant coach Rick Brunson has resigned amid reports that women had accused him of improper conduct.

Hood, who has seen his role reduced during his first postseason with Cleveland, will not be fined or suspended for refusing to enter Monday night\u2019s Game 4 blowout win over the Toronto Raptors in the fourth quarter, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press . Hood feels bad about the incident that happened with 7:38 left in the fourth quarter, and he expressed remorse on Tuesday to team officials about becoming a distraction, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. The person said disciplinary actions against Hood \u201cwere never a consideration.\u201d The Athletic first reported that Hood had angered teammates and others in the organization by rejecting coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s instruction to enter the game. ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reports that Hood has apologized to the team for his actions : With Cleveland leading 110-80 and on its way to sweeping the series, the Cavs called timeout to replace superstar LeBron James. Lue told Hood to check in but he refused, and guard Jose Calderon peeled off his warmup and jogged to the scorer\u2019s table. The AP observed at least one assistant coach shouting toward Hood. Earlier in the game, rookie Cedi Osman came in with the second unit and played the minutes that had been going to Hood in Lue\u2019s rotation. The 25-year-old Hood is averaging 4.6 points in 17 minutes in the postseason. His playing time dropped in the second round \u2013 he began the playoffs against Indiana in the starting lineup \u2013 as he struggled with his shot and looked uncomfortable on the floor. Hood scored just 2 points on 1-of-9 shooting in three appearances against the Raptors. The Cavaliers acquired Hood at the Feb. 8 trade deadline from Utah. A first-round pick in the 2014 draft, he averaged 16.8 points with the Jazz, but the 6-foot-8 left-hander has never found his rhythm with Cleveland, which is back in the Eastern Conference finals for the fourth straight season. Lue said he spoke with Hood at Sunday\u2019s practice and that he understood his role. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough circumstances as far as the first round and playing now and getting spot minutes more than anything,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe could be better, he knows that.

Geez, non-Cavs fans will grouse, would it have killed the Raptors to push back harder, maybe play a little tougher and not paved such an easy path for LeBron James and his guys to the East finals and, quite possibly, a fourth consecutive NBA Finals appearance? There are a couple of ways to answer that question. First, yes, it might have killed the Raptors, who were thoroughly outclassed in the series and exposed as a marvelous regular season team, as far as postseason contenders go. It would have been as out of character for the skilled and affable Toronto players to get overly snarly as it would be for James Harden to pick up a razor. The Raptors mucked things up a little in the second half of Game 3 and again Monday with DeMar DeRozan\u2019s flagrant 2 foul on Jordan Clarkson, all to little effect. The second way to answer the charge against Toronto would be to rightly shift some of the blame to the Indiana Pacers. It was the Pacers, after all, who challenged the Cavaliers across seven games . They had every bit as much to do with Cleveland finding itself as the East\u2019s best team, favorites restored to accompany James on his eighth straight trip to The Finals. When the 2018 postseason began more than three weeks ago, Cleveland often looked and still felt like a drawer of mismatched socks. A tortuous regular season \u2013 which felt like \u201cfour or five\u201d in one year, James said again late Monday \u2013 was interrupted at the February trade deadline by a hectic array of roster moves. Six players out, four new ones in, and still they hadn\u2019t proved to be the elixir so many inside and outside the Cavs organization envisioned. They kept hitting \u201creset\u201d on their learning curve. That meant James, who had appeared in all 82 games for the first time ever, had to dial up his already extreme level of responsibility and his performances for the playoffs. It looked, for an unnerving few days, as if it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. The Pacers grabbed series leads of 1-0 and 2-1, then blew out Cleveland by 34 points in Game 6 to push it to the max. And even when it was, James was getting less help than Indiana breakout star Victor Oladipo got from his troops. Seven Indiana players had scoring averages in double figures in the series. James had himself and Kevin Love, sputtering along at a non-All-Star 11.4 points per game. That\u2019s why so many folks assumed life only was going to get tougher for the Cavaliers against Toronto, the East\u2019s No. 1 seed. \u201cWhen everyone was burying my teammates alive throughout that first-round series,\u201d James said, \u201cI just continued to tell them, \u2018Listen, we can\u2019t win without each and every one doing their job and being as great as they can be.\u2019 I continue to preach that. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to lose confidence in our ball club, no matter what the stakes are, where we\u2019re down. Because if I do, then where are we going to go from the team aspect?\u201d The work the Cavs put in defensively against one elite scorer (Oladipo) helped in their coverage of the next (DeRozan). The sheer reps they got in 533 minutes of playoff basketball \u2013 11 games, including overtime in Game 1 vs. the Raptors \u2013 gave them more time to embrace each other\u2019s games, while providing coach Tyronn Lue extra chances to mix and match combinations. The improvement has been striking. Six Cleveland players averaged double figures in points in the sweep: James, Love, Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith, Jeff Green and George Hill. James went from scoring more than 36 percent of the Cavs\u2019 points against Indiana to a less taxing 28.7 percent against Toronto. The other Cavaliers left \u201cThe Other Cavaliers,\u201d a Saturday Night Live gag floating around the Internet since Saturday that mocked James\u2019 supporting cast, on the same cutting room floor where SNL producers dumped the original video. Cleveland is running more smoothly and looks better oiled at both ends. After getting outscored by 40 points in seven games in the first round, it outscored Toronto by 56 in the four victories. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going back, talking about that Indiana series,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI think that prepared us for this series. The physicality, the ball pressure really helped us going forward.\u201d Said James: \u201cDefensively in these 11 games, we\u2019ve been very, very, very good. Offensively we\u2019re starting to pick up. We\u2019re starting to get a rhythm, we\u2019re starting to know what we\u2019re capable of offensively and what we can become.\u201d The Raptors should be so lucky. They were left with a smorgasbord of doubts, what-ifs and looming uncertainty after getting eliminated for the third consecutive time by Cleveland. Concerns that the Cavs \u2013 and specifically James \u2013 might be in the heads of otherwise quality players such as DeRozan, guard Kyle Lowry and a few others look in hindsight to be valid. \u201cIt hurts, just because of the season we had,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cFranchise record (59 victories), top five in offense, top five in defense. (It\u2019s just) like we flipped a switch. That\u2019s what\u2019s disappointing \u2026 From our coaching staff, everything we tried to do, just didn\u2019t click.\u201d The Raptors were swept out a year ago by Cleveland and have lost their last 10 playoff meetings with James. DeRozan and Lowry, Toronto\u2019s All-Stars, combined for 138 points, 30 rebounds and 46 assists. James, all by himself, cancelled them out with 136, 33 and 45, while out-shooting the \u201cWe The North\u201d tandem to boot. This is LeBron\u2019s era and like several other championship aspirants, the Raptors merely are living in it. So what if Game 1 \u2013 the series\u2019 tone-setter, a grand opportunity squandered by the Raptors against a tired, still shaky Cavs crew \u2013 went to overtime. Big deal that Game 3 swung on James\u2019 banked buzzer-beater. Over time, every sweep looks like a dismantling, and this one will too. \u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cYou dwell on what should have happened, what could have happened in life, you drive yourself crazy. The fact of the matter is, we out. We done. Got to get back to reality come tomorrow.\u201d The Cavaliers get a couple of well-earned days off, while awaiting a winner in the Celtics-76ers series . When they get back to the gym Thursday, they\u2019ll be far better off than they were before either of the past two rounds. \u201cWe still have room to improve and things we can be sharper at,\u201d Korver said. \u201cWe still have some lulls in the game, it feels like where the all kind of stops and we don\u2019t have that same edge and energy. \u201cBut this series was a great step in the right direction.\u201d Blame the Raptors, and blame the Pacers too. Or, depending how you feel about James and his guys and their stranglehold on the East, credit them. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

McConnell's rare start makes huge difference for Philadelphia 76ers","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2013 T.J. McConnell probably wouldn\u2019t be in the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 rotation if No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz didn\u2019t have his issues (whatever they were) this season. Heck, McConnell might not be in the league if it weren\u2019t for \u201cThe Process,\u201d four years of mostly bad basketball where fringe NBA players were given opportunities in Philadelphia they wouldn\u2019t have gotten anywhere else. McConnell, undrafted out of Arizona in 2015, was signed to a cheap four-year contract by then-general manager Sam Hinkie. Because Hinkie didn\u2019t sign any veteran point guards that summer, McConnell got a chance to play right away. And he was good enough to stick around. Three years later, surrounded by teammates with a lot more talent, McConnell kept the Sixers\u2019 season alive by providing a huge spark in a 103-92 win over the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals . Sixers coach Brett Brown has noted multiple times during this postseason that his team had the best starting lineup in the league. Philly outscored its opponents by more than 21 points per 100 possessions in 600 minutes with Ben Simmons, J.J. Redick, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid on the floor together, the best mark among 29 lineups that played at least 300 minutes in the regular season. But with his team down 3-0 and the starting lineup having been outscored by 17 points in its 46 minutes over that span, Brown was willing to make a change. Covington was out and McConnell was in. And though Covington was the league leader in deflections and a candidate for first-team All-Defense, the change was primarily about that end of the floor. \u201cWe want to stay alive,\u201d Brown said afterward. \u201cWhen you start assessing where are the problems, there are some problems matchup-wise that we start the game with. You\u2019re always wondering who has (Terry) Rozier, as an example.\u201d Through the first three games, Ben Simmons had been the primary defender on Rozier, who was averaging 22 points on an effective field goal percentage of 64 percent. But on the minutes that McConnell guarded Rozier, neither the Celtics\u2019 point guard nor the Celtics as a group scored as efficiently as they do on average, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Beyond that, the Sixers were a plus-20 in McConnell\u2019s 38 minutes and a minus-44 otherwise through the first three games. Brown may have cost his team Game 2 when he chose to play Simmons instead of McConnell down the stretch. But Monday, with McConnell as his primary defender, Rozier scored just 11 points on 4-for-11 shooting. More important: Tthe Celtics scored just 18 points on the 29 possessions in which the two were matched up. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make him as uncomfortable as possible,\u201d McConnell said of the assignment, \u201cpicking him up full court and making him work for everything. He\u2019s their engine. Everything goes through him and he gets them going.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a tenacity with his defense,\u201d Brown said of McConnell. \u201cWe ended up having to put him on (Jayson) Tatum.\u201d Indeed, the 6-2 McConnell spent some time defending the 6-8 Tatum, who was the only Celtic able to do much offensively in Game 4. But McConnell didn\u2019t just make an impact on defense, adding a career-high 19 points, five assists and two offensive rebounds. His 39 minutes were also a career high, and more than he played in Games 1-3 combined. \u201cHonestly, I just thought I was letting the game come to me,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to do too much. If I saw a lane, I took it. If I had the open shot, I took it. I was just trying to find my teammates, as usual.\u201d There could be an issue playing McConnell and Simmons together, in that they\u2019ve combined to make three 3-pointers over the last two months. And they\u2019d played just 13 total minutes together through the Sixers\u2019 first eight playoff games. But on Monday, the pair got to the basket to the tune of 12 points apiece in the restricted area. The Sixers\u2019 adjustments went beyond the lineup change; they also ran more high pick-and-roll with their ballhandlers. \u201cIt just kind of freed up (T.J.) and Ben to get going downhill,\u201d J.J. Redick said. On defense, the Sixers were more aggressive. They didn\u2019t blitz pick-and-rolls the entire night, but a second-quarter stretch in which they did threw the Celtics out of rhythm and gave them control of the game with an 11-0 run. In total, it was Boston\u2019s worst offensive game of the series. For Brown, the aggressive defense was tied to the lineup change. Asking his team to blitz pick-and-rolls is asking them to play with more energy than if they were continuing to switch on every screen. \u201cWe need to come in with a spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to come in with a tenacity. T.J. epitomizes that, so we start him. To declare that to a team \u2013 and you\u2019re fighting for your life \u2013 to then be able to put them in an environment that lets them do it makes more sense to me as a coach.\u201d So does starting McConnell again Wednesday in Game 5 (8 p.m. ET, TNT). \u201cYou\u2019d think we\u2019d go with it, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Brown laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s gimmicky. I think it\u2019s real.\u201d John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

Van Gundy served as Pistons coach and team president since being hired in 2014 , but has was relieved of both roles by the team today. News of the move was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Rod Beard of The Detroit News . Team owner Tom Gores said parting with Van Gundy was a difficult decision. \u201cI am grateful to Stan for everything he\u2019s done for the Pistons and for the city of Detroit,\u201d Gores said in a statement released by the team . \u201cHe rebuilt the culture of our basketball team, re-instilled a winning attitude and work ethic, and took us to the playoffs two years ago. He went all-in from Day One to positively impact this franchise and this community. \u201cBut over the past two seasons our team has not progressed, and we decided that a change is necessary to regain our momentum,\u201d Gores said. The Pistons went 39-43 this season, missing the playoffs for the third time in four years under Van Gundy. Gores said in a statement released by the team that Van Gundy wanted to return for the 2018-19 season, which would have been the last on his contract. Per Wojnarowski, the move took place earlier today and will start the revamping of the Pistons\u2019 front office : Via Twitter, Wojnarowski reports that the Pistons\u2019 brass are expected to pursue an experience front-office type for the President of Basketball Operations role : Recent reports indicated that the Pistons wanted Van Gundy back, but perhaps in a different front-office role . Per Wojnarowski, Van Gundy and Gores met in early May and the owner, at that point, was reportedly willing to keep Van Gundy around. But, even then, Gores was looking to make changes to the Pistons\u2019 operating structure. Van Gundy went 152-176 over four years as Detroit\u2019s head coach with only one playoff appearance \u2014 a 4-0 first-round loss to Cleveland \u2014 to show for it. A decade ago, the Pistons were one of the game\u2019s most respected organizations after reaching the Eastern Conference finals six straight years and winning the NBA title in 2004. They sank quickly into irrelevance after that. Detroit missed the playoffs the final five seasons of Joe Dumars\u2019 tenure as team president, and Gores \u2014 who took over as owner in 2011 \u2014 eventually brought Van Gundy in, giving him authority in the front office in addition to his coaching duties. With center Andre Drummond leading the way, Detroit started 19-14 in 2017-18 and won on the road against the likes of Golden State, Oklahoma City and Boston. Then an ankle injury to point guard Reggie Jackson derailed the season, and not even the trade for Griffin in late January was enough to push the Pistons to the playoffs in their first season at downtown Detroit\u2019s new Little Caesars Arena. Van Gundy engineered the February trade with the LA Clippers for former All-Star forward Blake Griffin. Although Detroit got off to a hot start with Griffin, the Pistons stumbled down the stretch and missed the playoffs for the second straight season and third time in four seasons. Detroit went 8-4 when Jackson and Griffin played together. Additionally, the Pistons were 27-18 with Jackson, who suffered a severe ankle injury in late December and did not return until late March . Van Gundy was scrutinized by some Pistons fans for his recent work in the NBA Draft, which includes selecting Stanley Johnson over Devin Booker in 2015 and Luke Kennard instead of Donovan Mitchell in 2017 . This past season, Kennard shot over 40 percent from 3-point range, but he was taken one spot ahead of Donovan Mitchell in last year\u2019s draft. Mitchell blossomed into a Rookie of the Year candidate.

With all that has gone on around the league this season, the Warriors\u2019 storyline hasn\u2019t been quite as eyeballed nationally this season compared with previous years. (Not that they should care. It\u2019s just an observation.) The Cleveland Cavaliers blew things up last summer and reformed in the fall, blew it up again in the winter and reformed again in the spring. The Boston Celtics are displaying amazing resilience through seemingly devastating injuries to put themselves on the brink of another conference finals. The Philadelphia 76ers have their Fun Bunch. There was Paul George\u2019s trade to Oklahoma City (and all that entailed, now and later) and the Toronto Raptors\u2019 dramatic and successful changes throughout the year. And, at the forefront, there was the Houston Rockets\u2019 rise as a legit and serious challenger to the Warriors in the Western Conference. During the regular season, the Warriors\u2019 energy and productivity dropped off ever so slightly, like the planet killer in \u201cThe Doomsday Machine,\u201d one of the all-time best original \u201cStar Trek\u201d episodes, after the doomed Commodore Decker drove a Shuttlecraft right down its throat. (Of course, Captain Kirk figured out to destroy it . Dude, come on. This is James Tiberius Kirk we\u2019re talking about.) And at the end of the regular season, they were hit with a series of body shot injuries: Stephen Curry\u2019s MCL strain , Durant\u2019s ribs , Klay Thompson\u2019s thumb injury , Draymond Green\u2019s hip, and on and on. Those all sapped their continuity and made them look mortal down the stretch of the 2017-18 season, and the Warriors went 7-10 as the season waned. But, after dispatching the Kawhi Leonard-less Spurs in five games in the first round , and taking a 3-1 lead on the Pelicans now , they\u2019re again on the precipice of the Western Conference finals. A date with Houston is looming and a chance at a third title in four seasons is still on their racket. \u201cI think as the playoffs go on, every series requires a different intensity level,\u201d Green said last week. \u201cI think we met that standard that it takes to win playoff games at the level we\u2019re at right now, which is the second round. It\u2019s not our first rodeo. We\u2019ve been here a lot of times and we know what it takes.\u201d Steve Kerr rolled the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup out Sunday , the Lineup Formally Known as Death \u2014 Curry, Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Green and Durant. It\u2019s been their trump card for almost two years, the lineup that can\u2019t be solved by the opposition, even as it\u2019s chipped away at most of Golden State\u2019s other conventional units. Durant went for 38, and the Warriors rolled to a 118-92 win and a 3-1 series lead. They didn\u2019t use it much this season \u2014 that quintet only played 127 minutes together this season , after logging 224 minutes last season \u2014 because of all the injuries, because they tried to limit their biggest players\u2019 minutes and because using Iguodala as a starter thins out Golden State\u2019s bench. The Warriors\u2019 most frequently used five-man unit this season featured Zaza Pachulia at center; among five-man units leaguewide that played 200 minutes or more together this season, per NBA.com\/Stats, that quintet was third in the league in Offensive Rating, at 118.6 . But Pachulia hasn\u2019t played a minute in the playoffs, and if the Rockets are the Warriors\u2019 next opponent, he may not play much then, either, against Clint Capela. Kerr often points out that the Warriors have six centers on the current roster, and most of them have gotten at least a little run at various points. But after JaVale McGee was ineffective in Game 3 against New Orleans Friday, Kerr pulled his trump card. It\u2019s still a game-changer, and when a season comes down to a best-of-seven series, one game can be the difference. \u201cWe all bring the best of each other,\u201d Curry said of the Hamptons unit. \u201cWe increase the pace of the game, but the versatility (is) at the defensive end \u2014 Andre, Draymond, KD shoring up the paint, switching a lot of the screens and the action from the offense and Klay doing what he does on the perimeter. I think the biggest thing offensively is that we\u2019re all playmakers, try to look for the best shot, stay within ourselves and just make the right play.\u201d Going back to the old playlist may give the Warriors comfort in what has been another drama-filled season, with the contretemps about being disinvited from the White House by President Trump in September getting things off to a rollicking start. But the end of the season was what raised eyebrows around the league. Curry\u2019s absence down the stretch combined with a teamwide ennui \u2014 \u201cI really don\u2019t like talking about it,\u201d Thompson said \u2014 that gave potential playoff opponents hope they might be able to catch Golden State napping. The Warriors\u2019 boredom showed up most at the defensive end. After being in the top seven in both unadjusted and adjusted Defensive Rating in each of the last four seasons \u2014 including first in the league in both categories in the first championship season of 2014-15 \u2014 Golden State fell to 11th and 12th, respectively, in the regular season. They came out of the All-Star break focused \u2014 they were fifth in the league in Defensive Rating on March 1 . But all the injuries blunted their momentum, and the scariest of all \u2014 a serious injury to second-year guard Patrick McCaw in Sacramento March 31 \u2014 shook the team more than people on the outside realized. \u201cThroughout that time, we had spurts,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWe played a great OKC team. We went in there and won. Then we lost to Indiana by 20, and then it\u2019s like, when you\u2019re riding just on emotion a lot, you tend to go up and down. It\u2019s like a roller coaster. I think that\u2019s what it was. We had those spurts where we played well and played a focused game, but then Patty goes out, boom, and there was just so much that went on with that. Then Steph goes out with a freak injury. So much went on with that. I think we were just so up and down emotionally it kind of blinded us from our goal, which was to be good every single night as basketball players.\u201d McCaw\u2019s injury \u2014 a bone bruise suffered when he fell after a dunk attempt against the Kings, which required him to be carried off the court in Sacramento on a stretcher \u2014 hit everyone hard. \u201cWhen Pat got injured, I think that took a little bit out of us,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt took a little bit out of Steve as well. You could just feel it, when Steph went out, then I went out, then Draymond, then Klay. Our emotions were so up and down. When your emotions are, you have too many emotions in the game of basketball, it can kind of blind you from what you really have to do. This is a technical game. So when you put too many emotions into it, it kind of took us away from what we wanted to do.\u201d McCaw, who played in 57 games this season, was not only a part of Kerr\u2019s rotation. He is also a well-liked person who was getting better on the floor. He was re-evaluated last week and will be checked out again in a month. Though he\u2019s been traveling with the team during the playoffs, his season is almost certainly over. And as his injury came during the Warriors\u2019 many injuries down the stretch, its chilling effect was multiplied. \u201cIt definitely got to everybody,\u201d Green said. \u201cKind of the uncertainty of not knowing what\u2019s going on with him. The rotations. Everybody\u2019s like, ahh, kind of tiptoeing around, trying to make sure you get to the playoffs healthy. A lot of that makes a difference. I mean, that\u2019s our brother. To see him down like that, not be able to walk off the court under his own power, him not being around us for two or three weeks, it was kind of like the unknown. It sucked. And I think it definitely had an effect on everything.\u201d But Durant doesn\u2019t like the metaphor of the proverbial switch being turned on at playoff time explaining the team\u2019s improvement the last couple of weeks.   \u201cI don\u2019t like when you call it a switch,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause guys come in and get extra work in every single day. They work on their bodies every day, they get treatment. You come in here any time, you see guys in here working on their games. I think when you say \u2018a switch turned on,\u2019 if guys went cold turkey on everything as professionals during the season, and just tried to pick it up in the playoffs, I think that\u2019s turning on a switch. Mentally, focus-wise, game plan-wise, I think you can turn on a switch, because you can lock in on an opponent, you know their tendencies, you can just focus in on one group of players instead of one day it\u2019s San Antonio, the next day it\u2019s Phoenix, next day it\u2019s Sacramento. You\u2019re going so up and down. If that makes sense.   \u201cSo I think everybody\u2019s putting in that work individually all year, and as a team, you know, stuff has to come together. We have to focus in on what we need to do, game plan wise, tendency wise, just try to take away things. I think that\u2019s where you kind of turn it up just a bit.\u201d   Golden State has performed in fits and starts in the first two rounds. The Spurs didn\u2019t have enough firepower to be a serious threat, but they played hard and were increasingly effectively on defense as the series went on. The Warriors didn\u2019t really have an answer for LaMarcus Aldridge after Game 1. New Orleans had, until Sunday, been more and more successful at making the Warriors shoot contested shots.    That certainly gibes with Curry\u2019s return after five weeks. He\u2019s healthy, but rusty. After his adrenaline-filled return last Tuesday in Game 2 against the Pelicans, he made just 14 of 33 from the floor in the two games in New Orleans. There was talk afterward about breakthroughs for Curry cardiovascularly. The next few games will tell whether Curry is truly recovered and ready to be two-time Kia MVP Steph \u2026 or will he just be on the floor (as he was for long and important stretches in the 2016 playoffs after returning from a Grade 1 knee sprain ). The Warriors still made The Finals, but Curry wasn\u2019t Curry against Cleveland, and everyone, starting and ending with LeBron James, knew it .   No one in NBA history has changed the geometry of basketball more than Curry, and when he\u2019s on the floor, the ball starts flying around.   \u201cOur formula is simple: if we out-pass people, we win,\u201d Warriors forward David West said. \u201cBall movement. With guys going in and out of the lineup, it causes moments where guys try to carry the load, maybe try to shoulder the load individually. But the strength of the group is the group.\u201d   But the Warriors can still throw so many different things and people at you.   Iguodala shot a career-worst 28.2 percent on 3-pointers in the regular season. He\u2019s at 39.3 percent in the 2018 playoffs . Does anyone doubt he was biding his time until the postseason?   No one wearing an NBA uniform is in better shape than the 34-year-old Iguodala, no one is smarter about the game or matchups, and no one is a prouder, fiercer competitor. The 2015 Finals MVP brings his bag of intangibles with him on the road even more than at home, as he did Sunday. In that game, he was making life miserable for the Pelicans\u2019 Nikola Mirotic, creating deflections, making the right reads and impacting the game despite scoring just six points.     Kerr likened him to Scottie Pippen after Game 4, but Iggy wasn\u2019t buying it \u2014 \u201cSteve just does that to make sure I don\u2019t get mad \u2018cause I don\u2019t shots,\u201d Iguodala quipped.   He may be right. But Iguodala and Green have a mind meld defensively that\u2019s at the heart of the Hamptons\u2019 effectiveness.   \u201cAndre and I, we\u2019re usually on the same page,\u201d Green said. \u201cTwo guys who really think the game, especially on that side of the ball. Sometimes we can talk things out and it works perfect and not say a word, and know what each other\u2019s going to do. It definitely helps our team out defensively kind of having two coaches out there on the floor on that side of the ball.\u201d   Whether it\u2019s switching to guard each other\u2019s man, running at an open shooter to close before the ball gets there with the other man rotating, they know what the other guy is going to do. And that second or so the Warriors save defensively keeps them from being broken down.   \u201cHow fast can you make that decision?,\u201d Green says. \u201cHow demonstrative are you going to be about that decision? Are you going to second guess that decision? That\u2019s usually when it doesn\u2019t work; if you\u2019re going to go, just go. That\u2019s kind of the motto that Andre and I go by. If you\u2019re going to go, just go; everybody else fall in line and rotate, and we\u2019ll work it out from there.\u201d  And while Green and Rajon Rondo have been exchanging pleasantries throughout this series, Green didn\u2019t pick up his first postseason technical foul until Sunday. He\u2019s been under control, coming up to the edge without going over.   Someone without access to the internet asked Kerr if he\u2019d ever played with anyone who instigated or tried to get under the skin of opponents. It\u2019s a testament to Kerr\u2019s comic timing that he actually did wait a beat before answering.   \u201cI did play with Dennis Rodman,\u201d he said.   Never be fooled by Kerr\u2019s overall pleasant disposition and quick-with-a-quip acuity, though. He is a fierce competitor that wants to win big, the same as his current point guard, who is similarly underrated on the competition scale. Kerr has seven rings as a player and coach, and it\u2019s not a coincidence he\u2019s frequently been around teams that got it done in June.   But the Warriors are playing for even bigger stakes than just winning the 2018 title. Legacies are created this time of year. A third title in four seasons, with four straight Finals appearances, would put Golden State in very rarified air in the modern game.   San Antonio won three titles from 2002-07. But the Spurs, famously, never have won back-to-back titles. The Kobe Bryant-Shaquille O\u2019Neal-led Lakers, which won three straight from 2000-02 , are the closest modern-day team to pulling off what the Warriors are trying to accomplish. Before then, you\u2019re talking about the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, with six titles in eight seasons \u2014 the two non-title seasons coinciding with Jordan\u2019s sojourn to the minor leagues of baseball.    Moreover, the Warriors are the hub around which the modern NBA now spins. And that is an even bigger legacy.   Almost everyone (hi, Thibs!) tries to play the way Golden State does now \u2014 the quick hitters, ball movement, pace. Teams do it in different ways. The 76ers look very different than the Warriors, with Joel Embiid their centerpiece of operations, and with 6-foot-10 Ben Simmons taking up so much space with the ball in the halfcourt.   The Rockets look different still as there\u2019s not a ton of ball movement. There\u2019s just an unending series of screen and rolls with Chris Paul and James Harden with the rock, looking for the inevitable open man in the corner or way, way behind the 3-point line.   A lot of things have happened the last 15 years to lead us where we are now. The league changed almost all the rules regarding zone defense, and got rid of almost all defensive contact on the perimeter. Rockets GM Daryl Morey and others led the burgeoning analytics movement, which championed shooting more and more 3-pointers as a primary means of scoring, not as a novelty. Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s Phoenix Suns went with Amar\u2019e Stoudemire at center, surrounding him with four smalls that could all shoot it from deep, and scoring came out of its coma leaguewide.   Kerr and Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry have always been quick to credit D\u2019Antoni\u2019s influence on the modern game, starting in Phoenix and working through his current team in Houston.   \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that just eliminated the center position \u2014 let\u2019s just go small and fast and shoot more threes,\u201d Kerr said of D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI was inspired by Mike, but I was also inspired by Pop (the Spurs\u2019 Gregg Popovich) and Phil Jackson in terms of basic ball movement, screening. But pace is the name of the game these days, and people go about it in different ways. Ironically, Mike\u2019s team (in Houston) is the slowest team in the league now. I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d   But no one has put all of it together \u2014 pace, small ball, shooting and defense \u2014 like the Warriors have the last four seasons. The Rockets are the closest thing we\u2019ve seen to Golden State, and they\u2019re hungry, and they\u2019re coming. And the Warriors and Rockets are just a win apiece away from seeing the clash of the Western Conference titans.   They are in the middle of it, so they can\u2019t stop and think about what it all means. We get that. But everyone wants to put a marker out there that\u2019s hard to catch. LeBron is chasing a ghost . The Warriors have already made their mark on the game. They\u2019re almost in position to do more. History is forever.   \u201cIt\u2019s important, because it\u2019s what\u2019s right in front of us,\u201d Curry said Sunday. \u201cWe don\u2019t think about the historical context of anything. For us, we have an amazing group of guys, amazing coaches sitting behind us. We\u2019re appreciating the moment. That\u2019s really all it is. You have tunnel vision for Game 5 at home, then a new series, hopefully (after that). The historic context doesn\u2019t really seep into the locker room when it comes to what that means. It\u2019s just about this year.\u201d   * * *  Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Despite all the openings for which he interviewed, his pedigree and background \u2014 and, let\u2019s be honest, ambition \u2014 made one gig stand out above the others. And it\u2019s the one he got, with the New York Knicks. New York agreed to a four-year deal with Fizdale last week , a correct pairing of young coach and franchise that is trying to build back up the right way, with an emphasis on defense and conditioning that is right up Fizdale\u2019s alley. No matter the occasional oddity created by working for Jim Dolan, he is an owner who has been willing to spend money when asked, and his team is in the top media market on earth. When you win there, they have parades for you in the Canyon of Heroes, and you almost always wind up in your particular sport\u2019s Hall of Fame. You can\u2019t not take the shot. The Knicks believe they\u2019re in a place where the things Fizdale did in Miami and what he took to Memphis \u2014 his philosophy of culture-building, team-building, discipline and how he connects to players \u2014 were a good fit for where they are as a franchise. Among the 11 candidates the Knicks interviewed for the job, several had more head coaching experience than Fizdale \u2014 whose tenure in Memphis lasted exactly 101 regular season games and six playoff games . But Fizdale checked the most boxes, and at 43, the Knicks are betting he has a lot of growing and improving to do, just as the team does. The Knicks, of course, looked into just why the Grizzlies fired Fizdale so abruptly last season, after just 19 games. Team president Steve Mills and General Manager Scott Perry didn\u2019t just get started in the league last week; they know a lot of people. The chatter around the league was that Memphis chose star center Marc Gasol over Fizdale after the two clashed during the coach\u2019s season-plus there. As I wrote just after Fizdale was fired , the deterioration in their relationship reached the point of no return when Fizdale went after Gasol hard in a film session, basically dismissing the importance of Gasol\u2019s accomplishments overseas, including as a member of the Spanish national team. That that rankled Gasol to no end should have been no surprise to anyone paying attention. The Spanish team\u2019s international triumphs are a point of considerable and understandable pride for both Marc Gasol and his brother, Pau. They helped lead Spain to the greatest era of basketball accomplishment in that country\u2019s history, including a 2006 gold medal at what was then called the FIBA World Championships. Fizdale tried to fix things with Gasol, even flying to Europe after the season to try and make it right. But Gasol was close with majority owner Robert Pera; Fizdale wasn\u2019t. That closed off a potential area of outreach between the two. Gasol had no interest in rapprochement, a stance that Grizzlies players made clear to Fizdale throughout the season. (Caught most in the middle, per league sources, was Grizzlies veteran point guard Mike Conley, Jr., who did and does have strong relationships with both men.) But, importantly, in his discussions with the Knicks, Fizdale took responsibility for his failures with Gasol. He didn\u2019t blame Gasol or anyone else. As one of his chief calling cards is connecting with players, and not finding common ground with Gasol was an L he has to take. \u201cHe knew where he messed up and what he\u2019d try to let it never happen again,\u201d said a source who\u2019s spoken with Fizdale since his firing. But, equally importantly, just because Fizdale couldn\u2019t make it work with Gasol doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s doomed to a similar outcome with All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis . The 22-year-old\u2019s relationship with the Knicks has been scrutinized within an inch of its life the last couple of years. The toxicity level reached under former president Phil Jackson has abated some, but Porzingis and the team still have some navigation to do \u2014 a trip that is blurred as Porzingis continues rehabbing and recovering from the torn ACL he suffered in February . (Porzingis\u2019s brother, Janis, who serves as his agent, politely declined comment on the Fizdale hire via text Saturday, though the Knicks were in contact with Janis Porzingis during the coaching search.) Porzingis\u2019s injury keeps the Knicks in flux, a position it seems they\u2019ve been in most years since the Nixon administration. He is a potential superstar \u2014 \u201cpotential\u201d is used quite deliberately here, as \u201cThe Unicorn\u2019s\u201d stans on social media have made a very talented offensive player into something that he is not, at least not yet \u2014 a transcendent player. But, assuming Porzingis ultimately makes a full and healthy return, New York has a terrific building block around which to build. And, they have a chance to really get in the game in the summer of 2019. First, they\u2019ll have to resolve Joakim Noah\u2019s status \u2014 he has two years and roughly $38 million left on his current deal. It\u2019s likely the Knicks will stretch him and the only question is whether that happens before or after next season. If it\u2019s the former, the Knicks can spread the remainder of his salary across five seasons; if the latter, three seasons. Nothing is certain, but it would be surprising to see Noah still in New York by the start of camp. Why saddle a new coach with an old problem? That would leave the Knicks with more flexibility going into \u201919, which is when Perry has said he\u2019d like New York to be ready to pounce in free agency \u2014 and when the likes of Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard (player option) and Jimmy Butler (player option) can be free agents. But until that bridge year, Fizdale will have to max out the existing roster. Charitably, there\u2019s not a lot there at present that\u2019s proven and has led to much winning anywhere. The Knicks will need to be lucky in next week\u2019s Lottery \u2014 preferably, getting a high enough pick to land one of the elite big men that should be among the top four or five picks in the Draft. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the hope in New York is that until the roster improves, Fizdale can develop the talents of the Knicks\u2019 trio of guards \u2014 Frank Ntilikina, Emmanuel Mudiay and Tim Hardaway, Jr. \u2014 in which New York has invested Draft and literal treasure the last couple of seasons. (It will help that Fizdale\u2019s relationship with Hardaway, Jr., goes back to when the latter was a kid and his father, the master of the killer crossover , worked in the Heat organization after Tim Hardaway Sr.\u2019s playing days ended .) The additional hope is that Fizdale will get Ntilikina in elite shape while honing his competitive edge, and that a full season under Fizdale will let the Knicks know once and for all if Mudiay can be a significant contributor. Fizdale will also have to adjust his nomenclature. Last week\u2019s story in the New York Daily News correctly identified Fizdale\u2019s consistent referencing \u201cthe Miami Way\u201d as shorthand for how he wanted to do things in Memphis alienated Grizzlies people who were \u2014 again, justifiably \u2014 proud of the \u201cGrit-n\u2019Grind\u201d era that produced seven straight playoff appearances before this season\u2019s 22-60 crater. And, he\u2019ll have to be prepared to be, perhaps, the biggest face of the franchise, in a city whose media is dogged and nonplussed and will often go off cockeyed in a crazy, incorrect direction. But its influence should never be underestimated. Fizdale is from Los Angeles, and he has a great way with most. And it didn\u2019t hurt him to work some for ESPN while he was between jobs. But he\u2019ll have to learn the media landscape in New York quickly \u2014 who to befriend, who to be wary of, who he can trust and who he cannot. (Also: I\u2019m sure the Knicks pointed out to him that while he had several causes which were near and dear to him in Memphis, from advocating the removal of Confederate statues in the city to lending his name to other civic causes, he needs to win games in Gotham first.) At base, the Knicks will want to see players throughout the roster held accountable, and charged to compete on a nightly basis. There was not enough of either last season under coach Jeff Hornacek \u2014 who, in fairness, didn\u2019t have all that much time to put his stamp on what was a poor roster. Fizdale will get more time. The Knicks\u2019 roster will look a lot different in two years than it does now. Fizdale will have to be a lot different coach than he was in Memphis, as well. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Michael Sadoff: There may be some concern about the unusual ownership arrangement in Milwaukee, Michael, but trust me: every person getting interviewed will get over it if they can get their hands and careers on \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d train. They\u2019ll have no problem getting a quality coach there. Disillusioned in D.C. From Terry Whitehead: Living in D.C. as I do, Terry, I\u2019m very familiar with the frustration and anger of many Wizards fans that Grunfeld is still running the show. His tenure in Washington (he was hired in 2002) as GM is exceeded in the NBA only by Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, Pat Riley in Miami and Danny Ainge in Boston. And, they\u2019ve all won at least one NBA title \u2014 by contrast, Grunfeld\u2019s Wizards have not reached a conference finals. The first half (2002-10) of Grunfeld\u2019s reign was quite good. I have argued that his best move was one of his first \u2014 signing Gilbert Arenas to an offer sheet in 2003 that the Warriors, because of the cap rules at the time, were literally unable to match. It was shrewd and aggressive, and until Arenas tore his meniscus in 2007 , he was one of the most exciting players in the league and a true superstar that put butts in seats. The Arenas-Caron Butler-Antwan Jamison nucleus that Grunfeld assembled made the playoffs four years in a row, but came apart when Arenas got hurt in \u201907 and subsequently devolved into Wyatt Earp, leading to a rebuild that started just as Leonsis assumed control of the franchise in 2010.  I cite all that because Leonsis is on the record as saying he\u2019s judging Grunfeld\u2019s tenure from that point, not before he got controlling interest of the franchise . The second half (2010-present) has been much more problematic. Grunfeld got many of the big things right \u2014 taking John Wall ( 2010, No. 1 overall pick ), Bradley Beal ( 2012, No. 3 overall ) and Otto Porter Jr. ( 2013, No. 3 overall ) with Washington\u2019s highest Lottery picks. But he\u2019s missed on a lot, too. To me, his second half includes two glaring mistakes that would have gotten GMs in many other cities fired: blowing first-round picks in 2011 on Jan Vesely ( sixth overall ) and Chris Singleton ( 18th ), then whiffing completely on Kevin Durant in 2016 after spending two years positioning the Wizards to have the cap space to go after the DMV superstar. It would have been one thing for the Wizards to get turned down by Durant after going to the Hamptons and making their pitch, but they didn\u2019t even get a face-to-face meeting!  And that error was compounded after Washington\u2019s backup plan, Al Horford, signed with Boston , leaving the Wizards flailing and scrambling. It showed, as they gave $64 million to Ian Mahinmi and $26 million to Andrew Nicholson , then had to burn their 2017 first-rounder to get Nicholson off their books after less than a year to be able to re-sign Porter Jr. in the summer of 2017 without going deep into the luxury tax. Leonsis has said signing an impact free-agent to play with Wall, Beal and Porter Jr. to make the Wizards a \u201chave\u201d team, as he puts it, is the last step in the team\u2019s plan to become a true contender. With Wall\u2019s four-year extension kicking in after next season I don\u2019t see how they can do that before 2020, unless they stretch Mahinmi this summer and spread his remaining $31 million across the next five years, reducing his cap hit to just less than $6.3 million per year through 2023. If Washington did that it could be in position to be a significant player in free agency in 2019 while also having space to extend Kelly Oubre and\/or Tomas Satoransky. Otherwise, it would be 2020 before the Wizards could make a move. With the extension Leonsis is giving Grunfeld a final chance to finish the job. It is Grunfeld\u2019s third shot at remaking the franchise. There should not be a fourth. In most cities, there would not have been a second. They continue to be creative in Portland. From Zane Aitken:  Why would George opt in for 2018-19 and take away all his leverage to go wherever he wants? The whole point of the last year was to make sure he was free as soon as possible.

Only three of those 129 teams down 3-0 \u2014 the New York Knicks in the 1951 Finals against Rochester Royals , the Denver Nuggets in the 1994 conference semis against Utah Jazz and the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2003 playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks \u2014 have even forced a seventh game, with nine other teams getting to a Game 6 after falling 3-0. 1) There are people \u2014 including some that are well-paid to do so \u2014 who spend so much time trying to argue what is ridiculously not arguable: LeBron James is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. Ever. Stop hating and start appreciating what he\u2019s doing this season, which may be the most impressive of his 15 so far as a professional. (I\u2019m sure the other Cavs have a sense of humor about their station, right? Right? ) 2) John Madden used to always talk about going to a coaching clinic when he was just breaking into the business and listening to Vince Lombardi break down the intricacies of the Packer Sweep \u2014 for eight hours. Someday, Brad Stevens will similarly delight an up and coming coach by talking about his ATOs. 3) I would very much like to vote for President Austin now , please. 4a) A daily double from Sports Illustrated \u2019s great writer Chris Ballard: first, former Blazers and Heat power forward Brian Grant continues to put one foot in front of the other as he lives with Parkinson\u2019s Disease. 4b) Second, Ballard writes, again beautifully, on a quiet \u2014 and, perhaps, final \u2014 get together for Hall of Fame receiver Dwight Clark , who is coping as best he can with ALS, last month in Montana. 1) Agree with the Chuckster on this \u2014 you can\u2019t let LeBron get out of the corner with the ball with your season on the line, Raptors. I don\u2019t care if he passes the ball ahead and it\u2019s 4 on 3 and you\u2019re scrambling on defense; in that situation, with just six or so seconds on the clock, you\u2019ll take anyone else going 85 feet with the ball and making a play to beat you. O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakam are kids in this league, and I\u2019m not going to kill them if trapping LeBron was discussed in the huddle during the timeout before his game-winner and they made a mental error there. But you can\u2019t lose the game with the ball in LeBron\u2019s hands. You just can\u2019t. 2) This seems to never have any bottom to its depravity and disregard for the human being that died because of greed and selfishness. 3) Why, yes, Steve, Jessie would love to dance \u2026 just not with you!!! 4) Pathetic. Not surprising. And indicative of the tone and substance of much of the reporting done in sports these days . Do better. \u2014 Bulls center Robin Lopez ( @rolopez42 ), Sunday, 12:25 a.m, invoking the year Stevie\u2019s \u201cTalking Book\u201d came out and the year after Spielberg directed \u201cSchindler\u2019s List . \u201d That feels about right; LeBron is in the teaching\/legacy phase of his career as those two giants were on their respective sides of the street at that time. Tip of the cap to Mr. Lopez for historical accuracy. \u201cThe only way that our team becomes a really expensive team is if Paul George chooses to stay with the Thunder. So if you\u2019re asking me if we would like to keep Paul George if he wants to keep his talents in Oklahoma City, at the cost that it takes to re-sign him, the answer to that would be affirmative, yes. Paul George is a very unique player.\u201d \u2014 Oklahoma City General Manager Sam Presti, in his season-ending news conference , on the team\u2019s willingness to remain a tax payer next season \u2014 which it will regardless of what George decides to do, but whose tax bill will be significantly larger if George agrees to stay in OKC and signs a new deal this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s like I would have been better off not showing up, and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t show up for my teammates.\u201d \u2014 Jazz rookie phenom Donovan Mitchell, after the Rockets held him to 4 of 16 shooting and 10 points in Game 3 of the Utah-Houston Western Conference semifinals series last Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve got a medical card.

But be clear about this: the Utah Jazz are no longer the barrier between the Rockets and the goal. They\u2019re just standing in the way. There\u2019s a difference. Getting rid of the overmatched-yet-naggingly persistent Jazz is all about keeping pace with the Golden State Warriors or perhaps staying one step ahead of the defending champs, nothing more or less. A long-anticipated Western Conference finals, and perhaps a classic one, is impatiently waiting. And it\u2019s in the Rockets\u2019 best interest to settle their end of the bargain and, if possible, on the same night when the Warriors can do the same. And so, just a few hours after the Warriors went up 3-1 on the New Orleans Pelicans in the other West semifinal , the Rockets did likewise Sunday, using star power to overcome an otherwise blah performance. They only scored 100 points \u2014 a level that will certainly rise in the next round. Quite simply, they had James Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela when it counted \u2026 and Utah did not. And speaking of Paul, he\u2019s one win away from advancing to the West finals for the first time in his otherwise respectable career. His anxiousness to kill that annoying demon was evident in the third quarter of Game 4, when he scored 11 of his 27 points while drilling the Jazz with mid-range jumpers, and the game flipped in Houston\u2019s favor. \u201cI\u2019ve been here before, 3-1,\u201d said Paul on post-game TV, his memory still sharp from blowing that lead while with the Clippers four years ago, coincidentally against Harden and the Rockets. \u201c[Expletive] went bad real quick.\u201d It also happened to be Paul\u2019s birthday, and what more can a 33-year-old do to demonstrate that age is merely a number? \u201cHe was really big today,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI understand he has another birthday coming up Tuesday.\u201d It was a surreal night for Paul as well. While he was busy erasing the Jazz, his brother, CJ Paul, was being momentarily erased from the arena. CJ Paul, who handles much of his brother\u2019s personal affairs, was escorted from his lower-level seat by arena security in the third quarter for shouting at referee James Williams. He was allowed back to his seat moments later and claimed to be a victim of mistaken identity. \u201cThey thought I said something that shouldn\u2019t be printed,\u201d said CJ, right after he took a postgame phone call from Kiki Vandeweghe, the NBA\u2019s executive vice president of basketball operations. \u201cActually, it was a fan sitting next to me. I addressed the fan who said it. I told security what happened. After they let me back in, the security guy said, \u2018By the way, James said it was definitely you that said that. He didn\u2019t see you, but he heard you.\u2019 What, you mean out of 20,000 people? What\u2019s crazy is James reffed me when I was in college.\u201d CJ Paul, who has never missed any of his brother\u2019s playoff games, didn\u2019t miss much during his brief departure in this one, either. The Rockets stayed in control, save for some teases by the Jazz, and this is where they stand, right on the cusp, right with the Warriors suddenly swelling in their windshield. Remember, the Rockets built their team and their season around overcoming the Warriors. It is why they added Paul last summer. It\u2019s why Harden tweaked his isolation-dominant game to accommodate Paul. And it\u2019s also why the rise of Capela is raising the possibility of Houston bringing a new Big Three in Golden State\u2019s direction. That Houston won another game despite a toned-down offense and a vanishing 3-point shot \u2014 they made just 26 percent Sunday and in the last three games are at 29 percent \u2014 is either an impressive or troublesome trend depending on your hot take. D\u2019Antoni is playing up the former. \u201cWe haven\u2019t shot well the whole series,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s all different ways to win. We\u2019re not strictly a jump-shooting team. Chris has got the midrange. James gets to the hole. You\u2019ve got Clint down there. We\u2019ve got a lot of other stuff we can go to. The whole plan was to get that so we wouldn\u2019t be a one-dimensional team.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll get to 100,\u201d D\u2019Antoni added. \u201cAnyway, if we do our part defensively, we have a real good shot to win.\u201d Against the Jazz, does it really matter? Utah arrived this far on hard work, solid coaching and an otherworldly rookie (Donovan Mitchell), but those teams don\u2019t travel deeper than this in the playoffs. Their lack of star appeal is flaring up and gradually costing them right now. They started a rookie, a guy cut by the Clippers, an undrafted free agent, a Celtics\u2019 castoff and a center who can\u2019t shoot. Also, Derrick Favors isn\u2019t 100 percent and Ricky Rubio missed his third straight game with a bad hamstring . Then, in the third quarter, Dante Exum grabbed his hamstring and was done for the night (and perhaps for the series) . They\u2019re playing with house money after losing their franchise guy, Gordon Hayward, to free agency last summer. They won 48 games, had winning streaks of 11, nine and six after Jan. 22, grabbed the No. 5 seed and probably sent Paul George plotting an exit strategy from Oklahoma City after beating the Thunder in the first round. Then they stole a game from the No. 1 seed in the West, in Houston no less. What\u2019s not to like? And yet, reality is settling in Utah like the famous bronze sunsets in the Wasatch Valley. Joe Ingles shocked the Rockets with 27 points in the Game 2 win \u2026 and has scored 21 total points since then. Exum was a national talking point for 48 hours after becoming a Harden stopper in Game 2. Now, he\u2019s laid up with a sore hamstring. Mitchell had one insane quarter when the series shifted to Utah \u2014 his 13 points in the third quarter Sunday. Otherwise, not much else. Their plight was cruelly spelled out in a few sequences in Game 4. Mitchell stripped Harden and drove for a layup but couldn\u2019t convert. Ingles broke Capela\u2019s ankles on a step-back jumper but missed the three. Rudy Gobert took a pass and drove the lane \u2026 and Capela swooped from nowhere and rejected him. That was one of Capela\u2019s six blocks (to go with 15 rebounds), and he influenced roughly a dozen others. \u201cDonovan drove the lane and saw Clint and decided to pass, and that doesn\u2019t show up on the stat sheet,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere was a lot of that.\u201d Harden had issues once again against Utah after opening the series with 41 points. He shot poorly from deep, missing six of seven, and coughed up eight turnovers and couldn\u2019t take control of Game 4. That left the savior role to Paul. Such is the luxury the Rockets have this season; when one superstar is handcuffed, the other is released. Paul was the best player on the floor if not the most efficient. In 35 minutes he had just one turnover, and in addition to scoring, he chipped in with 12 rebounds and six assists. \u201cHe was extremely aggressive tonight, which is what we needed,\u201d Harden said. And why not? Paul can smell the next round and a chance, once and for all, to change the narrative with regards to his playoff history, which is an awkward fit with the rest of his playing history. When that was brought up to Paul, Harden respectfully interjected, \u201cHe\u2019s not thinking about that. We got a game Tuesday and we\u2019ll do whatever we can to close it out.\u201d Paul laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d he confirmed. There\u2019s no reason for that. The Rockets are suddenly on the verge \u2014 where they thought they\u2019d be all along. The Western Conference finals are tapping Paul and the Rockets on the shoulder and reminding them of their season-long mission statement. The Rockets are very much OK with that. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come this far,\u201d said Harden, \u201cjust to be up 3-1 in this series.\u201d No, not this one. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Losing the first two is urgent, something more troubling, a sense of one\u2019s playoff life flashing before one\u2019s eyes. Losing four? It\u2019s oh- vah . Oh-four is 1, 2, 3, Cancun, \u201cgone fishin\u2019\u201d and next season rolled into one. That leaves an 0-3 deficit, which mostly is sad. At 0-3, the story essentially has been written, a struggling team\u2019s fate decided. In the NBA, there is no wiggle room whatsoever \u2013 129 teams in league playoff history have fallen behind 0-3 in a best-of-seven, 129 teams have lost those series. Only three such teams even rallied enough to force a Game 7: the 1951 Rochester Royals against New York , the 1994 Denver Nuggets against Utah and the 2003 Portland Trailblazers against Dallas . And yet, nothing is official. The plug hasn\u2019t been pulled, flatline or not. That was evident Sunday when someone asked Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry one of those big-picture, assess-this-season questions. \u201cOur season ain\u2019t over yet,\u201d the Raptors point guard said, instinctively pushing back. \u201cAsk me that question when it\u2019s over.\u201d Narrator: It\u2019s over. Most who stayed up late Saturday consider Toronto\u2019s series against the Cleveland Cavaliers to be over not only because they trail 0-3 but because of the way they got there . Specifically, LeBron James\u2019 unlikely, drive-left, shoot-right, one-footed bank shot at the buzzer that won it, 105-103. It enthralled the sellout crowd at Quicken Loans Arena, but appalled the Raptors\u2019 traveling party of three dozen or so. Folks who care probably have watched the final play multiple times. The Raptors officially haven\u2019t watched it other than in real time. Coach Dwane Casey intentionally did not subject his players to a film session Sunday. \u201cWe know what the issues are, what they were,\u201d Casey said after the team\u2019s light workout at the practice gym inside the Cavaliers\u2019 arena. \u201cFrom a team standpoint, 17 turnovers broke our back. Some of our schematic things we didn\u2019t cover properly broke our back. The things that led up to the end of the game are what we need to clean up.\u201d More precisely, it was the things that led up to the fourth quarter that cost Toronto. From that point, the Raptors were pretty good, outscoring the Cavaliers 38-26 while sinking seven of their 11 3-point shots. They got all the way back from a 14-point deficit in the quarter, tying at 103 only to have their hearts stomped on by James\u2019 spectacular finish. Before that final quarter, though, Toronto was too reckless with the ball. It had missed 16 of its 22 from the arc. And one of its two All-Stars, wing DeMar DeRozan, had played his way to Casey\u2019s bench, with 3-of-12 shooting, unimpressive defense, a mere eight points and a minus-23 rating. Casey\u2019 explanation for not putting DeRozan back in the game was simple: The guys he was using were rolling. It was a snapshot of the bottom-line approach he and his staff will need again in Game 4 Monday  (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT). DeRozan, naturally, doesn\u2019t want anything like it to happen again. This LeBron\/Cleveland stuff has been heavy enough: nine consecutive playoff defeats, three straight postseasons being put out by the Cavaliers and, personally, the onus in this man\u2019s NBA of 2018 to be 0-for-16 from 3-point range in the 13 playoff games since 2016. DeRozan didn\u2019t run from the lousy stew of frustration, anger, resignation and embarrassment he felt while his brothers kept plugging. As Saturday turned into Sunday \u2013 an \u201cextremely long night,\u201d DeRozan said \u2013 the Raptors\u2019 leading scorer in 2017-18 (23.0 ppg) ruminated pretty good. \u201cIt was rough. As a competitor, definitely rough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s something you carry over to today. Let it fuel you. \u2026 I\u2019ve had lots of [times] where I got down on myself. It\u2019s all about how you respond. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing much you can do, honestly, but watch the time go by. Wait for when the time comes to be able to get this feeling off you. And in order to get that feeling off you is to go back out there, help your teammates and get a win.\u201d Lowry, asked how they would manage that, reduced his formula to one word. \u201cRumble,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what, you rumble. Rumble, young man, rumble.\u201d Toronto did play with overdue physical force in Game 3 and will make that a priority again. Rookie OG Anunoby\u2019s individual defense on James has been solid, generally without overt double-teaming. Through the three games, though, the Raptors have committed 18 more fouls and 20 more turnovers, too many mistakes when losing Game 1 in overtime and Saturday by that single bucket. Whenever it gets here for the Raptors, the summer is going to be longer than they\u2019d hoped. So, going out strong does matter. \u201cYou choose to continue to fight,\u201d Casey said of his players. The Toronto coach recalled his days as an assistant in Seattle, when the SuperSonics fell behind 0-3 against Michael Jordan and the Bulls in the 1996 Finals . Rather than fold, they won the next two games at home in the 2-3-2 format to force the series back to Chicago. Said Casey: \u201cGuys just made up their minds, \u2018We\u2019re not giving in. We\u2019re not quitting. We\u2019ve got too much sweat equity.\u2019 We won the regular season conference title. Guys put in the work to get where they are. We\u2019ve got a group of young players who committed to getting better and did. \u201cThe easy thing to do is just to write us off and write ourselves off. But you choose to be a warrior. You choose to continue to fight.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

For all of the games Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala have finished together, never before had they played as a starting five. In this series against the New Orleans Pelicans, Kerr had restrained himself until now. But with the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d playing in Game 4 of this Western Conference semifinal, the Warriors crushed the spirit of the Pelicans early in a 118-82 drubbing that gives Golden State a 3-1 series lead . Game 5 is Tuesday night at Oracle Arena, where Kerr promised to give Warriors fans a chance to see what the rest of us witnessed at Smoothie King Center. The devastating combination of speed, athleticism, playmaking and scoring ability the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d used simply overwhelmed the Pelicans. The Warriors had a 17-4 lead before the crowd could catch its collective breath and the outcome was never in doubt from there. Durant made absolutely sure of it. He knocked down two jumpers in the first 90 seconds and the tone was set. To Kerr, it was not the lineup itself that changed the game, but rather the force with which the new lineup started Game 4. \u201c[Durant] was attacking tonight right from the beginning,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd he was brilliant. There\u2019s not much you can do because he\u2019s so tall and long and he\u2019s going to be able to get his shot off over you. But I just thought he found better spots on the floor with his aggression and created easier shots for himself. \u201c\u2026 The other night we were standing around. Tonight, after they made their first stand on the defensive possession, we just kept playing. And that\u2019s kind of who we are, multiple playmakers, move the ball and let the next guy make a play and don\u2019t force anything. \u2026 It just set a great tone.\u201d The Warriors indeed got punched in the mouth in Game 3 Friday night and Durant made it his mission to ensure it didn\u2019t happen again. The Warriors led by 18 in the first quarter, by 23 after the third and down the stretch, the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d got a long rest. Durant sensed the mood around his team at practice on Saturday. He went to work on his game, examining everything he would need to do to outplay Pelicans\u2019 superstar Anthony Davis. Their Game 4 performances were an intriguing study of a player who has thrived on a critical playoff stage time and again \u2026 and one who is learning what it takes to make that leap. Durant, the reigning Finals MVP, was ruthlessly efficient, finished with a game-high 38 points (on 15-for-27 shooting), nine rebounds, five assists, a steal and a block in just 36 minutes. He took advantage of Pelicans defensive ace Jrue Holiday (who dwarfs him by six inches) and anyone else the Pelicans sent his way. Davis, in his eighth career playoff game, scored 26 points on 8-for-22 shooting and grabbed 12 rebounds. But he also had six turnovers and spent long stretches without so much as calling for the ball as the Warriors picked the Pelicans apart. The gulf between Davis and Durant was striking, even after the game. That\u2019s when a hoodie-wearing Durant showed up to the postgame news conference by himself, while Davis did not speak to reporters in the hallway outside of his locker room. If you\u2019re going to take on the pressure and responsibility that comes with being \u201cthe man,\u201d you have to do it during the good times and the bad. And you have to light that fire for your team from the opening tip, the way Durant did. \u201cKD \u2026 he was just KD,\u201d Iguodala said when asked what led to the Warriors\u2019 explosive start. \u201cHe got to his spots, got to his shots. It kind of reminded me of MJ (Michael Jordan), and I don\u2019t like to make that comparison, but he got to his spots and there was nothing you could do about it. \u201cAnd when you see that look in his face it carries over to the rest of the guys and then you take that to the defensive end and you get stops, you know it\u2019s right \u2026 the mentality is there.\u201d The Warriors have always understood how dangerous their small lineup can be, but it doesn\u2019t suit them all the time. Sometimes, Kerr\u2019s hands are tied based on matchups. Once the Warriors got rocked in Game 3, Kerr knew exactly what his counter move would be. \u201cA nytime we \u2019 ve been in any danger over the years, we \u2019 ve sort of gone to this lineup,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhether it \u2019 s as [the] starting group or extra minutes, and obviously the lineup worked or whatever, but it \u2019 s not about the lineup. It \u2019 s really not. It \u2019 s about how hard guys play and how focused they are. The effort on both ends tonight was night and day from Game 3, and I thought our guys were just dialed in. \u201d \u201cMy discussions with Steph and KD were more strategic. They already know. They\u2019re superstars. Stars have to be stars in the playoffs. Steph and KD don\u2019t need to be told that. But my job as a coach is to try to help them strategically, so I talked to both of them about how I thought they could attack and get better shots. And we just did a much better job executing offensively.\u201d Obviously, it helps to have five players as versatile and skilled as the \u201cHamptons Five,\u201d a moniker given to that five-man group after the other four ramped up their recruiting of Durant during a visit to the Hamptons in the summer of 2016 . Yet Kerr didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the nickname. But you can call it whatever you want when a player like Durant is added to a potent championship mix. \u201cNow that\u2019s the group that has two banners hanging in the rafters,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said as he entered his postgame news conference. It\u2019s the group that needed every bit of what Durant provided in The Finals last year , when he outshined Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James. That slender assassin from that series was back at it Sunday against the Pelicans. \u201c I \u2019 m just my best when I \u2019 m free and having fun out there and forceful, I think that was the thing,\u201d Durant said. \u201cTo play with force no matter if I miss shots or not, just try to keep shooting, keep being aggressive, and you know I just tried to continue to tell myself that over the last day-and-a-half. Today we went out there and knocked down some shots. \u201d The same mentality will be required in Tuesday\u2019s Game 5. Close-out games require the best from any team, even one with the recent NBA title history the Warriors boast . Durant and the rest of the \u201cHamptons Five\u201d know what \u2019 s on the horizon. They have the muscle memory from their 2017 Finals journey, with a group so devastating that, when playing at its best, can take apart any foe in the NBA. \u201cYeah, just the experience. Guys have been there before. Just an IQ for the game, \u201d  Durant said of the \u201cHampton Five\u201d lineup. \u201c You know, you got most of the guys that can penetrate and make plays. It \u2019 s good for scorers like Klay, Steph and myself. You know Andre and Draymond do all the utilities stuff like driving to the rim, getting stops, getting rebounds, and you know they were knocking down shots when they got the opportunity to shoot \u2018 em. I think we played off each other well. \u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here and  follow him on Twitter .

Things Toronto did better, as far as its intensity and tactics compared to the first two games of the series against Cleveland . Things the Cavaliers nailed and, too, things they botched, leading by as many as 17 points in the second half at Quicken Loans Arena. There were lineup changes, defensive adjustments, and a general coarsening and muscling up of the on-court interactions that made Game 3 of this Eastern Conference semifinals round way more interesting than the two that came before. Then that guy makes that play at that point. And everything else seems to fall away. LeBron James sprinted end-to-end in the final eight seconds and sank an improbable, drive-left, shoot-right, kiss-it-off-the-glass floater at the buzzer to lift the Cavaliers to an exhlarating 105-103 victory . The sellout crowd of 20,562 exploded in giddiness, while the unfortunate Raptors mostly looked dazed . This was one part gut punch, one part yank-out-their-hearts-and-show-them-to-the-Raptors-before-they-die, as far as the cruelty involved. Showing up late to the ball to begin with, already dragging from losses up in Toronto that didn\u2019t reflect the strong regular season they had, the Raptors showed real toughness and resiliency down the stretch. Enough that, had this been Game 1, you\u2019d say we all were in for a dynamite series. As it was, the Raptors scored 38 points in the final 12 minutes, two points shy of their first-half total. Down 79-65 when the fourth quarter began, they sank 13 of their 18 final shots, seven of 11 3-pointers, and controlled the boards. Coach Dwane Casey kept All-Star wing DeMar DeRozan \u2013 who was hurting their cause at both ends \u2013 over on the bench near him for the game\u2019s last 14:16. Casey got solid performances from surprise starter Fred VanVleet, who started for the struggling Serge Ibaka, and then from a rejuvenated Ibaka himself. Point guard Kyle Lowry, who runs hot and even pulled James down to the floor this night, kept his head enough to score 15 of his 27 points in the fourth. And rookie forward OG Anunoby, tasked with primary defensive responsibility on James, went from scoring 12 points on 10 shots, total, through Games 1 and 2 to giving the Raptors 18 points on 7-of-12 shooting. It was Anunoby\u2019s 3-pointer with 8.8 seconds left \u2013 his fourth of the game, his third of the quarter \u2013 that got Toronto even at 103-103. Cleveland, by that time, was dwelling on all the mistakes it had made. For sure, Anunoby\u2019s 3-pointer \u2013 none of the Cavs accounted for him as 10 men scrambled downcourt, Toronto out of timeouts \u2013 was cringe-worthy from the home team\u2019s perspective. But the Cavaliers got real sharp from there. They have in James the NBA\u2019s ultimate closer, the corporate fixer who capable of cleaning up most embarrassing messes. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue set the stage by not advancing the ball to the frontcourt after using his team\u2019s final timeout. The reason: Give James room to roam. The Cavaliers could space the floor better without cramming everyone into the halfcourt for a static inbounds play. There was plenty of time for James to race to the far end, and all that real estate made it difficult for Toronto to trap him with two defenders. It did, in fact, as the play began but he quickly shed them. That left Anunoby on the left side of the lane. The other Raptors stayed snug to their men, lest James find one open for a clean look. That included C.J. Miles, who was sticking close to Kyle Korver in the left corner, even as James barreled his way in Superman mode (more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings). \u201cLeBron\u2019s shot was way tougher than Kyle hitting a three from the corner,\u201d Miles said, a shrug in his voice. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking at where he\u2019s going. And he\u2019s shooting a one-footed floater from 15 feet with his body facing the crowd. There\u2019s no need for me to help off Kyle Korver in that situation. If it\u2019s a different shot or he\u2019s got more of a rhythm to it, then maybe I jump in a little bit.\u201d James had made a circus shot to beat Indiana in Game 5 of the first round. He had thrown up several worthy of the big top Thursday, hitting one fadeaway after another, each trickier than the last. This one? It lacked only a calliope as three-ring entertainment. But yes, as impromptu and awkward as it looked, it was a shot James work on. Because he apparently works on everything. \u201cThe ability to have different things in my tool box and the repertoire that I have,\u201d James said, \u201cthroughout the game I can kind of go to those. That\u2019s just another instance where I had an opportunity to go to something I practice or kind of mess around with, tinkering with shots and things, finding angles.\u201d Said Korver: \u201cI ran out of words a while ago. I\u2019ve seen him shoot that shot countless times when he\u2019s just messing around at shootaround or in practice. It\u2019s always like, \u2018When would he shoot a shot like that? Maybe to win a playoff game, I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d For drama, for showmanship, it\u2019s hard to top James in the NBA postseason. There was a little fudge factor with the game tied, same as with Game 5 vs. Indiana. The worst that could have happened? Overtime. But no one in the building was thinking that when his shot banked in, framed by the orange backboard lights of time running out. The play-by-play sheet hardly did the highlight justice: \u201c:00.0 L.James 10\u2019 driving back shot.\u201d It was so much more, to the Raptors as they stare out of their 0-3 holes, to the Cavaliers as they start to sniff a postseason run gaining serious traction and to James himself. Such opportunities and successes are not lost on him, he said. \u201cOh yeah. Listen. Tie game, down one, whatever the case may be, I live for those moments,\u201d the Cavs star said. \u201cI told y\u2019all in the Indiana series, that mental clock of being a kid and just telling myself \u20183, 2, 1\u2026\u2019 and making the noise of the net sound, I\u2019ve been doing that since I was 6, 7, 8 years old. \u201cMaybe even before that \u2013 there\u2019s a picture floating around of me besides a little tyke\u2019s hoop, saggy Pampers on. I was doing it back then, all the way up till now at 33.\u201d * * *"},{"id":40617,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ben-simmons-struggles-against-boston-celtics-game-3","date":"2018-05-06","title":"Ben Simmons struggles during OT loss to Boston Celtics in Game 3","content":" * Recap: Celtics 101, Sixers 98 (OT) One minute you are the toast of the town, the presumptive Rookie of the Year and sitting on top of the basketball world after winning your first-round playoff series and looking like one of the faces of the future of the game.

But, of course, this isn\u2019t the first time LeBron has come through with the victorious shot in the postseason \u2014 he has five of them, to be exact. Let\u2019s take a look back at each of LeBron\u2019s buzzer-beating game-winners in his career. The scene: The Raptors staged a huge second-half rally, fighting from 17 down to tie the score at 103-103 with eight seconds left in regulation. But rather than put the Raptors in position to keep their season alive, it merely gave James the opportunity to author yet another legendary moment. Taking the ball full court, LeBron dribbled to the left side of the key and put up a difficult runner off glass and in to give the Cavaliers an all-but-insurmountable 3-0 lead . The scene: Indiana fought back late to forge a 95-95 tie and actually had a chance to win. But James came up with a big block on Victor Oladipo\u2019s driving layup and Cleveland gained possession of the ball with three seconds left. That set the stage for LeBron, who caught the ball, took two dribbles to his left and nailed the 3-pointer. The scene: Chicago led the series 2-1 and had built an 11-point lead late in the game. But Cleveland rallied, took the lead and then saw its lead disappear with less than 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Chicago\u2019s Derrick Rose tied the game with 8.4 seconds left on a driving layup, giving Cleveland the ball with no timeouts left. James tried to win the game on a layup from the right wing, but had his shot blocked out of bounds. Matthew Dellavedova inbounded from the baseline to James, who popped out to the left corner for a 3-pointer that gave the Cavs an 86-84 win and Game 4 of the 2015 Eastern Conference semifinals . The scene: A matchup between two of the best teams in the Eastern Conference in 2012-13 did not disappoint once they met in the Eastern Conference finals . Then-Pacers star Paul George did all he could to try and lead Indiana to a win, first by sending the game to OT with a clutch 3-pointer and then by nailing three free throws in OT to give Indiana a 102-101 lead with 2.2 seconds left. But that was more than enough time for James to save the day. He took an inbounds pass from Shane Battier, drove the lane on the left side and nailed a layup to seal a 103-102 win in Game 1 . The scene: Although LeBron and the Cavs would ultimately fall in the 2009 Eastern Conference finals 4-2 , this shot is perhaps the most memorable moment of that series. Orlando climbed from a 23-point hole to take the lead, 96-95, on Hedo Turkoglu\u2019s 11-foot jumper with 1 second to play. That merely set things up for James\u2019 first career playoff-game winner, though. Taking the inbounds pass from Mo Williams, James only had time to turn his shoulders toward the rim and fire. He did just that and hysteria ensued inside Quicken Loans Arena ."},{"id":40636,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-take-advantage-ongoing-process-philadelphia-76ers","date":"2018-05-06","title":"Disciplined Boston Celtics take advantage of Philadelphia 76ers' late-game meltdowns to take commanding lead","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens is the king of the mid-possession timeout. His team will start running its offense, Stevens will see something he doesn\u2019t like, and he\u2019ll stop the play to draw up something different. It happened twice in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Saturday. With 26 seconds left in regulation and the Celtics down two, Marcus Morris was isolated against the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Ben Simmons on the left side of the floor. Stevens didn\u2019t like it, so he asked for a timeout that the referees granted just as Morris was rising for a shot \u2026 that missed. With eight seconds left in overtime and the Celtics down one, Morris again had the ball in his hands, this time on the right side of the floor. Stevens again asked for a timeout, which the refs granted after Morris had given the ball to Al Horford in the low post against Ersan Ilyasova. \u201cI was kicking myself a little bit when Al caught the ball in the post when I did call timeout,\u201d Stevens said about that one. \u201cWe were going to get a pretty decent look with that, because they weren\u2019t going to leave our shooters.\u201d They got more than a pretty decent look instead. Both mid-possession timeouts resulted in layups for the Celtics, examples of how one team just executed much better than the other in a tightly-contested playoff game with a lot riding on it. The Celtics made plays, the Sixers made mistakes, and Boston has a 3-0 series lead after a 101-98 victory on Saturday. They\u2019ll have a chance to complete a series sweep in Game 4 on Monday (6 p.m. ET, TNT) . Horford was ready to go to work against Ilyasova on that overtime possession, but he wasn\u2019t going to second-guess his coach. \u201cI learned to just trust this instincts and judgement,\u201d Horford said. \u201cHe sees certain things.\u201d Stevens actually called another timeout when the Celtics had trouble inbounding the ball at the end of OT, because he saw something else. With the second one, Horford set screens for Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, and the Celtics cleared out the weak side of the floor. That gave Robert Covington no help when he switched onto Horford. Morris inbounded the ball over Covington and Horford had layup that put Boston ahead. In regulation, it was Brown who got a layup after setting a screen and rolling to the basket. Because the screen was set from the baseline, Ilyasova couldn\u2019t get between Brown and the basket after switch. \u201cIt seems like he just makes the right decision every time,\u201d Horford said of Stevens. \u201cAnd it worked out for us tonight.\u201d When you get to the postseason, both teams know what the other likes to run at the end of games. And it comes down to execution. The Sixers were on the wrong side of the execution battle on Saturday, with four brutal, late-game blunders that will keep them up at night. After the Brown basket that tied the game in regulation, J.J. Redick threw a pass to no one as Simmons knocked over Joel Embiid at the free throw line. The Celtics\u2019 Terry Rozier picked up the loose ball and found Brown on the other end for a layup that put Boston ahead with 1.7 seconds left. Marco Belinelli saved the Sixers with a baseline jumper at the buzzer, but his feet were on the line as he left the floor, so it only tied the game. Sixers coach Brett Brown said afterward that the play he drew up was designed \u201cto be a walk-off three.\u201d And Brown thought it was. So, did the guy in charge of confetti at the Wells Fargo Center, who pushed the button that drops the stuff from the ceiling even though the initial call from the refs (confirmed by replay) was that it was a 2-point shot. Yes, the Sixers\u2019 late-game execution was so bad on Saturday, it extended to the game operations group. The ensuing delay to clean up the slow-falling debris wasn\u2019t as painful as the Sixers\u2019 mistakes in overtime. First was a soft Embiid pass intercepted by Rozier, resulting in a Horford free throw that got Boston to within one. Then after an offensive rebound, Simmons tossed up a shot with 18 seconds left, with the shot clock off, and with no need to shoot. He missed, giving Boston the chance to go ahead. After Horford put after-timeout layup did just that, the Sixers had a chance to execute their own ATO. But Horford intercepted Simmons\u2019 inbounds pass to Embiid. Late-game turnovers are not a new issue for the Sixers. They had seemingly learned how to close, outscoring the Miami Heat by 41 points in the fourth quarter over their five-game, first round series. But they clearly still have some learning to do. Brown admitted that \u201cour guys, at times, look young,\u201d but didn\u2019t want to use that excuse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI give credit to the Boston Celtics. They played in the Eastern Conference championship last year with a handful of the players that they have. We are navigating through this. This isn\u2019t entirely a youthful thing at all. Nobody write that. Some of the matchups have hurt us.\u201d \u201cWe made mistakes and it doesn\u2019t matter how old we are,\u201d Embiid added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that we\u2019ve never been in this position. You got to give them a lot of credit. They competed. They showed up when it was the time to show up, and we didn\u2019t.\u201d Horford \u2013 \u201cthe stabilizer for our group,\u201d according to Stevens \u2013 has been the best player in the series, one step ahead of the Sixers at all times. And while Philly floundered, he made big plays on both ends of the flor on Saturday. \u201cThese are the kind of moments,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you want to be in as a basketball player.\u201d More moments are coming. The Celtics are one game away from the Eastern Conference final. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

James did what he\u2019s always done: he made it look easy, something impossible for 99.9 percent of the rest of humanity. GAME SITUATION: Unlike the pressure-packed situation of Game 5 against Indiana in the previous round, the Cavs had a little breathing room and a lot more confidence with a 2-0 series lead and the Raptors already reeling from James\u2019 ridiculous 43-point performance on Thursday. Zoom in a little closer, and you\u2019ll see the score was tied, which meant the game would merely have gone into overtime had James missed. He didn\u2019t, and the Cavs now enjoy a stranglehold of a 3-0 series lead as a result.  CELEBRATION: James appreciates those who have gone to battle with him before, and it showed in the immediate aftermath of his game-winner. First, Kevin Love reenacted Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals by being the first to rush to James and give him a fierce bear hug. The rest of his teammates joined in to mob their superstar teammate. Several teammates got individual notice after that, including longtime teammate JR Smith. The duo exchanged one of the best post-game-winner high-five and finger-pointing sequences you will ever see. Best of all, James did enormous justice to his delirious fans by hopping onto the scorer\u2019s table and urging them to bask in the utter glory of the moment. The common thread through all these moments? James\u2019 unrestrained and clearly visible happiness over once again coming through for Cleveland. GRADE: The slightest of deductions is in order given the decrease of pressure compared to his season-saver against the Pacers. That should not, however, disallow you from enjoying yet another chapter of LeBron\u2019s game-winning awesomeness. Four-and-a-half Horrys .

The body was surprisingly trim and fit, but Hakeem Olajuwon is 55 now and any hope of him suiting up and checking in at the scorer\u2019s table is only a dream. So, he just settled for some playful shooting drills and a comical one-on-one against a Rockets\u2019 staff member to pass the time. But the Hall of Famer and two-time champion is helping his former team anyway by mentoring Clint Capela. Their workouts are more serious and obviously more important to the cause and follow a very simple pattern. \u201cHe tells me what to do,\u201d said Capela, \u201cand I do it.\u201d That\u2019s the proper way to learn from a legend, by being a sponge and taking those lessons and putting them into play. And anyone who has watched Capela this season, and especially in this playoff series against the Jazz , can claim witness to the rapid rise of the young center. Once an ornament and now a core member, Capela\u2019s role is suddenly critical to the Rockets\u2019 championship hopes, partially due to a big assist from the Dream. \u201cHe comes to me every day at practice, saying, \u2018You should try this, try that.\u2019 He really believes I can do this,\u201d said Capela. \u201cWhen a guy like that comes to practice every day and is constantly telling you how good you can be, you start believing it.\u201d Yes, the 23-year-old from the hoops hotbed of Switzerland who just two years ago was raw and clunky is still pinching himself, with the Jazz feeling the sting. More precisely, Jazz center Rudy Gobert is getting punished; Capela is outplaying him at both rims and sometimes drastically so.  Capela is averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds to Gobert\u2019s 13 and 10 and the difference goes beyond the numbers. Offensively, there\u2019s no comparison. Both are mainly catch-and-dunk centers, although Capela is more capable of creating his own shot and brings softer hands and better footwork. When Capela took a pass and dribbled twice for a layup in Game 3, something he wouldn\u2019t even consider pulling off a few years ago in practice, let alone a game, his teammates erupted. \u201cHe\u2019s out there doing Eurosteps,\u201d said Harden. And Capela is bringing the same rim-protecting shadow as Gobert, a strong favorite for the Defensive Player of the Year award. He blocked four shots Friday and discouraged others. Remember, Capela is only 6-10, four inches shorter than Gobert, yet more mobile on the switches and help defense. With production comes faith and trust from coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who\u2019s giving Capela 32 minutes a night in the playoffs, by far the most playing time of Capela\u2019s four-year career. That\u2019s more evidence of where Capela stands in a system that favors three-point shooters. \u201cWhat he does for us as a team and me as a coach is invaluable,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. \u201cWhen I took the job, he was sitting at the kid\u2019s table at the wedding. I didn\u2019t know if he could take the leap from part time player to center on a team that was built to win a title. He\u2019s done that and been terrific.\u201d After the Rockets drafted Capela with the 25th pick in 2014 , he was a teenaged backup to Dwight Howard. Capela was unpolished and there were some troublesome offensive signs; his free throw shooting was especially poor and he was invisible beyond 10 feet from the rim. They brought in Olajuwon, who was training various NBA big men during the summers, to take on an ambitious project. Capela was born the year Olajuwon helped the Rockets to their first championship. Capela\u2019s brother gave him old DVDs of Olajuwon, and YouTube videos also helped, and all they did was cause Capela to develop a serious phobia. \u201cYou saw how amazing he was and it made you a little intimidated when the workouts started,\u201d Capela said. \u201cIt was hard to relax at first. I was like, wow he\u2019s really talking to me? Really, me?\u201d Olajuwon\u2019s first goal was to improve Capela\u2019s footwork, and in this sense, it was similar to taking dance lessons from Astaire. Olajuwon\u2019s feet were sharpened from playing soccer as a kid, which Capela did as well, so the basics were there. Next: Catch the ball. Capela had to learn to anticipate the lobs and bounce passes from Harden and then use a gentle touch to drop layups with no hesitation. The last two seasons, as his minutes and touches have increased, Capela is averaging 64 percent shooting. Evidently, he\u2019s catching the ball and putting it where it belongs, and it\u2019s starting to become instinctive. Harden now has no qualms about finding Capela on the pick and roll, which is suddenly the most devastating play in the book. \u201cHe\u2019s such as a good passer,\u201d said Capela. \u201cIf I\u2019m there the pass going to be, like, perfect. Doesn\u2019t think about turnover. I\u2019m like, \u2018Damn every time this guy sees me he just throws it to me.\u2019 Makes me confident.\u201d Finally: Olajuwon wanted him downcourt, and quickly, to fill the lane for layups or get position in the post while the Rockets spread the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see how he has developed,\u201d said Olajuwon. \u201cJust the way he runs the floor and his fundamentals. He plays naturally, very confidently. And he has that toughness. He doesn\u2019t back down.\u201d As a rookie, Capela took two shots a game. Now it\u2019s nine. His scoring average this season was 13.9, up from two his rookie year. In these playoffs, it\u2019s 16 points. But Olajuwon didn\u2019t want Capela to neglect the defensive end, so he expressed the importance of triggering the fast break with rebounds and blocked shots. \u201cEvery shot is contested,\u201d Olajuwon said. D\u2019Antoni said: \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see. People don\u2019t go in for layups because of the intimidation factor. When we run and get a good pace, it works on our favor, and that starts with Clint and what he does on the defensive end.\u201d Capela\u2019s most noticeable growth is in his confidence; his flow and his poise, which is evident and a direct result of his improved play and increased results. One feeds the other, and the combination will make him a favorite (along with Victor Oladipo ) for Most Improved Player. \u201cI\u2019m in my fourth year now, and I can try stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten more aggressive about my moves and offensively, and it was all from Hakeem. \u201cI know where I\u2019ve come from since I got here and the work I\u2019ve put in, how to make myself important to the team. I\u2019ve been in the gym, I\u2019ve been watching a lot of film. I\u2019m just glad everybody sees it. It brings me even more motivation about what I\u2019m doing.\u201d The Rockets were 42-3 during the regular season when Capela, Harden and Chris Paul were on the floor together and they\u2019re up 2-1 on the Jazz. Harden tells him: \u201cJust go out there and play with some swagger and hoop.\u201d Olajuwon says: \u201cBelieve me, he has so much more to offer that you haven\u2019t seen.\u201d The more you see, the bigger the role and visibility and impact at both ends by a center who\u2019s expanding through the playoffs, the more it\u2019s worth asking: Do the Rockets have a Big Three? Capela smiled. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Ricky Rubio, who suffered a strained hamstring in the final game of Utah\u2019s first-round series against Oklahoma City , is ruled out for Sunday\u2019s contest against the Rockets. Utah has made do by running more of the offense through rookie sensation Donovan Mitchell and veteran forward Joe Ingles while playing reserves Alec Burks and Dante Exum more minutes. The adjustment was enough to steal Game 2 in Houston before Friday\u2019s Game 3 setback. In the first playoff appearance of his seven-year career, Rubio is averaging 14.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 7.0 assists per contests. The Jazz are hopeful his return will alleviate the defensive attention given to Mitchell, who suffered a 4-for-16 shooting night en route to scoring just 10 points in Game 3.

It might be their parents\u2019 fault. If all those fellows were several years younger or \u2013 this works, too \u2013 considerably older, they wouldn\u2019t be chasing an NBA championship during the LeBron James Era. A little older, and the Raptors might have chafed a little during the Tim Duncan Era. But the San Antonio Spurs always left a little air between their title runs, allowing other contenders to dream and occasionally win. Toronto might have done just that before James put the East into a seemingly endless headlock. A little younger, and they\u2019d just be getting poised to duke it out in the East with Philadelphia and Boston for long-term supremacy. Maybe Indiana or Milwaukee will bubble up, too. No matter, the key would be hitting one\u2019s prime when James is three or four more years beyond his. Or, who knows, relocated to the West by then. As it is, though, the Raptors are trying to break through in the teeth of the LeBron Era, during which James has built a big, beautiful wall around the NBA Finals, allowing no one else to represent the conference other than his Miami or Cleveland teams. It\u2019s going on eight years now, and seven consecutive Finals, since a non-LeBron team came out of the East: the 2010 Boston Celtics . With Cleveland looking revived after two games against Toronto, after laboring to survive its seven-game first-round series against the Pacers, it\u2019s looking more and more as if those steaks will reach nine and eight. Blaming Mom and Dad might be the best available option for dealing with James\u2019 ever-lengthening Era. Because one can look in the mirror in abject frustration only so long without wanting to smash it. Longtine NBA player and executive Wayne Embry knows exactly how the Raptors are feeling, in a way that goes beyond his job title as Toronto\u2019s Senior Basketball Advisor, a role he has held since 2004. Embry was born on March 26, 1937. Bill Russell had been born on Feb. 12, 1934. Three years and six weeks? Too close. Tough luck, Embry. Embry has been involved with the NBA for nearly 60 years. He is enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and as the first black general manager (Milwaukee, 1972) and president\/CEO (Cleveland, 1994), he\u2019s been a pioneer. But as far as chasing NBA championships, like the guys on the team for which he currently works, Embry too might have been born at the wrong time. Ironic that a fellow whose nickname in his playing days was \u201cThe Wall,\u201d based on the numbing picks he would set at 6-foot-8 and 240 pounds, would run into a series of walls so often keeping him from the titles he sought. Oh, Embry won one championship as a player and one more as an exec. But having come on the scene in 1958-59, he would have welcomed a few more over the years. But nope. It was other guys\u2019 eras. \u201cTrying to overcome greatness,\u201d Embry calls it. \u201cIt started in Cincinnati with Oscar [Robertson] and the Royals,\u201d he said the other night, a couple hours before tipoff of Game 2, Raptors-Cavaliers. \u201cWe had to overcome Bill Russell and Sam Jones and that bunch. We had some knock-down, drag-out series with them, and on a couple of occasions we had leads. We\u2019d beat them on their home court, they\u2019d beat us on our home court.\u201d  The Celtics won the championship from Embry\u2019s rookie season through his eighth year in the league. It was the natural order of things, apparently, so when Boston\u2019s Red Auerbach traded for him shortly before the 1966-67 season, Embry thought his ship had come in. \u201cFinally, I joined the team we couldn\u2019t beat, and here was my chance to win a championship,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, my first year there, we had to try to overcome greatness in Wilt Chamberlain. They snapped the Celtics\u2019 string that year.\u201d The 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers had one of the most dominant seasons in league history, setting a record for victories at 68-13 with a killer lineup featuring Chamberlain (24.1 ppg, 24.2 rpg, 7.8 apg) at the peak of his powers, with Hal Greer, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson, Wali Jones, Billy Cunningham and coach Alex Hannum. Fortunately for Embry, the Celtics bounced back the following spring. \u201cWe came back from being down 3-1 against Philadelphia to beat them, then beat the Lakers in the Finals,\u201d he said. \u201c So, we were able to overcome greatness then. But we had greatness on our team, too.\u201d The Lakers had some of their own, by the way, in Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, who lost six times to Russell\u2019s teams in the Finals. Embry went to Milwaukee in expansion in 1968-69, getting ground down in his final season as a player by logging more than 3 0 minutes nightly at age 31, while averaging 13.1 ppg and 8.6 rpg . Russell won his 11th and last ring that spring. In 1970, Embry moved into a front-office role with the Bucks, who by that time had drafted game-changer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Embry was assigned to talk his old Royals roommate, Robertson, into accepting a trade to Milwaukee. He did and the Bucks won big, taking the title in 1971 and reaching the Finals again in 1974. \u201cI came into greatness when Kareem was there, and Chicago was on the other end,\u201d Embry recalled of a strong Bulls squad that included Walker, Bob Love, Jerry Sloan and others. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t overcome us. It just drove [coach Dick] Motta crazy.\u201d Milwaukee might have been able to keep it going, even with Robertson retiring in 1974, except that Abdul-Jabbar decided he wanted to live and play elsewhere. He and his rep, longtime UCLA booster Sam Gilbert, made a trade-him-or-lose-him-to-the-ABA ultimatum, so after a final Bucks season, Kareem was sent to the Lakers. Embry, arm twisted, at least laid the foundation of a Milwaukee contender with players and picks he got back. That team \u2013 came to include Brian Winters, David Meyers, Junior Bridgeman, Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief and Bob Lanier, coached by Don Nelson \u2013 won between 50 and 60 games for seven consecutive seasons in the 1980s. Yet those Bucks never could get past Julius Erving\u2019s (greatness) Philadelphia teams or Larry Bird\u2019s (greatness) Boston teams in the same postseason. And the \u201880s wound up being defined either by the Celtics or Magic Johnson\u2019s (greatness) Lakers. Embry had moved to Cleveland by the middle of that decade \u2013 just in time for the Michael Jordan Era. As the good as the Cavaliers got with players such as Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper, Larry Nance and John (Hot Rod) Williams, they never overcame Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the Bulls. \u201cWe thought, one through 12, we were better than the Bulls,\u201d Embry said. \u201cBut part of what defines greatness is having the ability to make other players better. It manifests itself in different ways, and that\u2019s what Michael did with those Bulls.\u201d Don\u2019t Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Dominique Wilkins and another dozen stars from the Jordan era know it. A native of Springfield, Ohio, Embry grew up as a fan of the Cleveland Browns (\u201cwhen they were good\u201d) and the Indiana, who in 1948 had made Larry Doby the American League\u2019s first black player. He attended Miami (Ohio) University, played his first eight NBA seasons in Cincinnati and had his longest, most decorated tenure as a team executive with the Cavaliers. So, with these recent playoff clashes between the Raptors and the Cavaliers, Embry felt conflicted when he had a speaking engagement in Cleveland a few months ago. He knew what likely was coming again this spring. During the appearance, Embry was asked to sing the Cavaliers\u2019 fight song along with the fellow who wrote it. He declined, saying, \u201cMy allegiance is to another team that\u2019s competing against the Cavs.\u201d But Embry did keep a place in his heart for Cleveland\u2019s 2016 championship, which ended the city\u2019s long championship drought. \u201cI became very emotional when I watched the parade on television,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of all the years we tried to get there and had to overcome Michael, had to overcome greatness. To see them finally get there and win a championship was just great for the city.\u201d The Era of LeBron James began soon after Embry left some 15 years ago. He and the team he\u2019s rooting for now have been stymied to this point. \u201cI tell these guys, we\u2019ve had a great season. We won the top seed. But we haven\u2019t won anything yet, so let\u2019s respect our opponents,\u201d Embry said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respect your opponent, you don\u2019t prepare. You\u2019ve got to be prepared mentally each time you go out on the court.\u201d As daunting as the task might be, it doesn\u2019t help to be demoralized, Embry said. Or for that matter, too deferential, the way some took DeMar DeRozan\u2019s memorable comment after the 2017 sweep. \u201cIf we had LeBron on our team, too, we would have won,\u201d DeRozan said then. No one said it would be easy, playing in the same space and time as legends. But it can be special. \u201cThat\u2019s what competition is all about,\u201d Embry said. \u201cThere\u2019s no greater joy than to beat those guys. So, you should be inspired every time you step on the court. That\u2019s the way I always felt when I played Russell or Wilt or other guys \u2013 I wanted to beat \u2018em. \u201cYou stay focused on what\u2019s right in front of you, you don\u2019t get intimidated and you play the very best you can. If you let greatness intimidate you, you don\u2019t belong on the court. You let greatness inspire you.\u201d And if greatness happens to roll an ankle at an inopportune time in a best-of-seven series? No apologies necessary, Embry said. \u201cNope, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all part of it. Injuries are one of the variables that go into winning and losing.\u201d Having your own era is the biggest variable of all. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That makes it tough to know what Rajon Rondo is thinking at any given time, what\u2019s going on in that complex basketball brain of his in the heat of the moment. And that\u2019s just the way the veteran point guard likes it. Ask him an obvious or silly question and you\u2019ll probably get an appropriate answer, the way several reporters did after Rondo helped fuel the New Orleans Pelicans to Friday\u2019s 19-point rout of the Golden State Warriors in Game 3 at Smoothie King Center. \u201cWas there anything you guys changed against Kevin Durant tonight?\u201d he was asked. Anyone who has been around Rondo long enough knew exactly what was coming. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said with shrug. \u201cWas it an aggressiveness?\u201d the reporter asked, searching for an answer to a question that was never coming. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Rondo shot back, smiling at his teammate Ian Clark sitting by his side. \u201cI mean, we try to keep our secrets to ourselves and just make adjustments for Game 4.\u201d For Rondo to be in this position today, when the Pelicans host the Warriors in Game 4 in the Western Conference semifinals , is a tale unto itself. That he\u2019s leading the Pelicans the way he is, however, should surprise no one. Whatever you think of Rondo \u2014 and he\u2019s been labeled as everything from brash, brilliant, brooding and belligerent over the course of his 12 seasons in the league \u2014 his impact on these Pelicans in his first season with the team has been undeniable. Clearly, he has some of that point guard magic left in him. The Pelicans needed him and the attitude he brings, more than they probably understood until now. The major knocks on his game \u2014 he can\u2019t shoot and at 32 he\u2019s lost a step or two \u2014 have not hampered his ability to light a fire on this team. And down 2-0 in this series with their season on the line Friday, he responded with the NBA\u2019s first 20-assist playoff game since he did it last with Boston in 2011. With all of the fancy upgrades at the position in recent years, including opposing point guard and two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry, there\u2019s still room for a throwback, pass-first brawler like Rondo in today\u2019s game. There\u2019s always use for a player capable of controlling the floor without needing to score 20 points to do it. Rondo had just four points while grabbing 10 boards and setting the Pelicans\u2019 team record with 21 assists in Game 3. \u201c I think Rondo always does that, \u201d  backcourt mate Jrue Holiday said.  \u201c (It \u2019 s) the way he attacks the basket even though they \u2019 re backing off of him, the way he pushes the pace off of the rebound, and the way he \u2019 s fighting for rebounds. His fighting for rebounds and being able to push the pace is huge for us. \u201cIt makes us want to run the floor and get to the corners. Knocking down shots is a lot easier when he does it, it \u2019 s always on time. Him being able to do that is huge for us, confidence wise. He just pushes the pace we want to play. \u201d Rondo\u2019s fit with the Pelicans has been a revelation given the way his tenure has ended everywhere else he\u2019s been recently. The Celtics eventually went younger when Brad Stevens was hired to help facilitate that rebuild. Stints in Dallas, Sacramento and Chicago all ended with Rondo\u2019s reputation taking a beating, though he did develop some good chemistry with DeMarcus Cousins in Sacramento, which no doubt played a factor in the Pelicans being interested in him last summer with Cousins already in the fold after a trade with the Kings. Still, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry needed confirmation that Rondo would be the right piece in his program, a player willing to go through the necessary give and take as they tried to reshape things around Anthony Davis, Cousins and Holiday. \u201cThe visit I had with him in Louisville (last summer) I thought went great,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI thought we hit it off in that some of the same things he wanted was a lot of the things I wanted to give him anyway. The freedom to run the team, and I think it\u2019s easy to do in certain situations. \u201cBeing a guy that has had Steve Nash, or being on Doc\u2019s staff with CP (Chris Paul) there and obviously being on the Warriors with Steph there, I just thought that the natural thing to do was to give him the ability to run the team and make a lot of decisions. And we agreed that there would come a time when my voice would have to be the deciding voice. And he was fine with that.\u201d Gentry said they also analyzed Rondo\u2019s skill-set and felt he would be the ideal trigger man for their unique assemblage of stars. \u201cWe watched a ton of film on him and we thought that giving him a situation where he could play with more paced and a game being more wide open, he really hadn\u2019t played that style of basketball really that we play,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cMostly, it\u2019s been pushing it in certain situations, but not the way we play, where we want to lead the league in pace. And I think he saw an opportunity here to play that way.\u201d Perhaps the best of what Rondo has brought to the Pelicans during this playoff run is the dark side, that edge they lacked before his arrival. Check with Portland Trail Blazers, swept in the first-round by the Pelicans, or Warriors All-Star Draymond Green if you need confirmation. Rondo\u2019s been in Davis\u2019 ear all season long, demanding the face of the franchise show no mercy and dominate every night. It\u2019s a quality that all of his teammates have come to appreciate, though, because they know his motives are pure. He wants to win in the worst way and doesn\u2019t mind stepping on a few toes or bruising some egos to get them there. \u201cIt\u2019s been great having him here,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cThe communication is great. He\u2019s the one guy that will text you at 2 a.m. and say, \u2018hey, have you thought about this?\u2019 or \u2018hey, I think we can do this.\u2019 That\u2019s just who he is. And the other thing is he\u2019s not afraid to get on guys. And they know anything that he says to them is for the benefit of the team and the benefit of themselves. \u201cLike I said, having him here has been great for us and then it\u2019s been great for me because I like picking his mind about certain things. You know, \u2018how did you guys do this?\u2019 or \u2018how did this happen in Boston?\u2019 He\u2019s a good basketball mind to have around.\u201d These are all the traits, Gentry is convinced, that will make Rondo an ideal candidate for the coaching business when he\u2019s done playing. \u201cI don\u2019t like using the term basketball savant because everybody says that,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cBut he really does love the game. I really do think the guy is going to be a great coach in this league one day, if that\u2019s what he wants to do. And I think it is what he wants to do. I think he\u2019ll have a good feel for it.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Hours after Ben Simmons, the unapologetic and self-proclaimed best rookie in the NBA, laid an egg against the Celtics by scoring one measly point and instantly became a social media punch-line, Mitchell refused to pile on his rival. This took guts, especially after Simmons dismissed any comparisons between himself and Mitchell weeks ago, but Mitchell went high road and had a veteran\u2019s response anyway: \u201cThe biggest thing that people don\u2019t understand is that every player has that night. You look at LeBron against the Mavs in the Finals \u2026 there was one year when I was watching Harden in a playoff game against the Warriors and he had like 10 turnovers. So it happens to everybody.\u201d Yes, to everybody \u2026 and how prophetic, even to Mitchell, who rose to stardom by chopping down Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the first round, only to come close to pulling a Simmons in Game 3 of the Jazz-Rockets series Friday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t really do much as a whole,\u201d he said. He struggled. He wasn\u2019t a factor. This wasn\u2019t the rookie who pulled the Jazz to the playoffs by commanding double teams and dunking with force and dropping shots from deep. This was different. This was \u2026 one of those games Mitchell spoke about. He missed 10 of his first 11 shots. His 10 points were his lowest for a game since Feb. 7 when he scored seven against the Grizzlies. \u201cI had terrible shots,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many shots I missed, but the shots I missed were terrible shots that weren\u2019t good looks. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Therefore, there were two factors which made for a strange and non-typical night for the Jazz. His disappearance, along with Utah\u2019s No. 1-rated defense coughing up 39 points in the first quarter, gave the Rockets a breezy 113-92 victory and a 2-1 series lead . The Rockets finally broke 110 points for the first time this series, no major surprise given James Harden and Chris Paul and their three-point mentality. That\u2019s too much fire to keep contained for very long. And whenever the Rockets break loose as they did, it puts massive pressure on the Jazz to keep up, which they couldn\u2019t, if only because they\u2019re not built for engaging in a scoring contest with most teams, let alone the Rockets. It\u2019s the surest way to a quick basketball death. \u201cFor us,\u201d said Jazz coach Quin Snyder, \u201cthe margin for error is not so great when you play a team [like Houston].\u201d Just as alarming is Mitchell\u2019s slow fade this series. He\u2019s shooting 33 percent overall and 24 percent from deep, and this is sudden and unexpected, even against the No. 1 seed in the West. Maybe not for most rookies. But Mitchell raised the bar for himself after a strong regular season and a ballistic effort against Oklahoma City where he averaged 28.5 points and 7.2 rebounds and never once looked overmatched or uncomfortable in his first taste of the playoffs and high stakes. And isn\u2019t that the ultimate sign of respect for a player, when a poor game, or a small string of them, are met with a surprise reaction? Mitchell has made himself into that special player already. He\u2019s the rare dunk contest winner who\u2019s just as dangerous from deep, a one-two combo that won over his Jazz teammates quickly and made him the club\u2019s No. 1 option almost from the jump. Mitchell\u2019s money move is a rapid burst off the dribble into the lane, where he\u2019ll then execute a smooth spin move garnished with a gentle finger roll for the basket. OKC still has flesh wounds from that move. He delivered constantly in the final few months when the Jazz became one of the top three teams in the NBA, at least record-wise, and soared up the West standings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are the only rookies to hit 200 points faster in the playoffs than Mitchell, who did so in eight games. But those shots haven\u2019t fallen with regularity here in the second round, and this was punctuated in Game 3. Either the Rockets have wised up \u2014 which usually happens when a team sees the same player every other night in a playoff series \u2014 or the rookie wall is playing a cruel trick on Mitchell by rising up in May. Snyder is betting on the former: \u201cThey shaded Donovan to his left hand and he has to adjust to that, and I think he can.\u201d Mitchell doesn\u2019t really have a choice if the Jazz plan to extend this series. There\u2019s nobody riding shotgun on Utah that frightens anyone; Joe Ingles dropped 27 on Houston in Game 2 but followed up with six. Other than Mitchell, there\u2019s no consistency, nobody who\u2019s a big threat, and when others turn chilly, Mitchell is often forced to press, which he did Friday. Chris Paul said: \u201cWe just tried to make it tough on him. Donovan\u2019s been great all year but Trevor [Ariza] is good defensively and Clint [Capela] is challenging him at the rim. He\u2019s a tough cover and it\u2019s hard to stop him with one person. Guys have to do it collectively. We try to make him feel crowded.\u201d Which means the Rockets will take their chances on Ingles and Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert beating them, a wise strategy. Mitchell\u2019s load is heavier than most rookies, even more burdensome than Simmons\u2019 in Philly from a scoring standpoint. Simmons has Joel Embiid and JJ Redick. Mitchell must be the lead singer for Utah, or else. Those are the odds, anyway, and the Rockets exploited that Friday. \u201cI think the biggest thing is, my mindset has always been the aggressor,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cNow they\u2019re playing me in a certain way where I\u2019ve got to make certain passes that I just didn\u2019t make the entire game. That will be what I\u2019ll take away the most. It\u2019s like I would\u2019ve been better off not showing up, and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t show up for my teammates. I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d That\u2019s some pretty strong accountability there. However, Mitchell can\u2019t do it all against a team like Houston, even though he\u2019s done exactly that up to this point of the season. He may not be a \u201crookie\u201d anymore, or play like one, but he\u2019s human. Much like Simmons and everyone else. Here\u2019s more of what Mitchell said about Simmons: \u201cIt just so happens that it happened to him, and I expect him to respond back. He\u2019s a good player. Good players respond back, and it\u2019s all about the response. It\u2019s a testament to his character. But it happens. He can\u2019t play great every night. It\u2019s not as easy as some people think.\u201d No, it isn\u2019t, and the league\u2019s showpiece rookies discovered the hard way, on back-to-back nights, here in the playoffs where rookies don\u2019t normally shine or at least for long before they\u2019re figured out. Yet, as Mitchell said: It\u2019s all about the response. Game 4 is Sunday, a day for atonement.

His memory is as long as Anthony Davis from head to toe, so like everyone else in the Smoothie King Center Friday night, the notion that a 20-point lead late in the fourth quarter against the Golden State Warriors was safe just didn\u2019t compute. Gentry was caught up in the moment, trying to win a game in this Western Conference semifinal after dropping the first two in Oakland. And he was trying to block out the memory of the Pelicans\u2019 last home game against these Warriors in the playoffs. He had the perfect seat then, next to Warriors coach Steve Kerr, his top assistant and offensive coordinator, the man in charge of engineering an epic comeback from a 20-point deficit that would lead to a Game 3 win in that first-round series and an eventual sweep of the Pelicans that helped propel the Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green-led Warriors to the NBA title in 2015. So yeah, it was on his mind, even if everyone else in the building tried to say it wasn\u2019t, that it was ancient history and that it had no impact on this current Pelicans team. Gentry knew better than that and confessed as much as his team drew blood in this series with an emphatic 119-100 Game 3 win this time around. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to stick with you,\u201d Gentry said of that pivotal 2015 game that ultimately led to the Pelicans hiring him away from the Warriors. \u201cI was on the Warrior bench then and I thought [the Pelicans] played great game. And because I was on the Warrior bench it made it so scary tonight \u2026 I was there when Steph started making threes and then Klay started making threes and before you know it a 20-point lead was nine points and then seven points, and then all of a sudden Steph made a shot out of the corner, which by the way I have a picture of that on my phone that I\u2019ve kept all of these years and now I can erase it off. \u201cBut they\u2019re just a scary team, you never feel comfortable. Even when he [Kerr] took his guys out, I was like \u2018let\u2019s play two more minutes before we take [our] guys out. Because you are just never comfortable with that team.\u201d Gentry helped chase the ghost of that 2015 game away for the a franchise, a city and especially his stars on Friday night. Both Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday were on that team that collapsed three years ago. They needed this win more than they realized, more than they cared to acknowledge late Friday night after the building had cleared out and everyone had a chance to process what had just transpired. The Pelicans beat the Warriors at their own game, employing the \u201cappropriate fear\u201d Gentry joked about with the media afterwards. It was all there, starting with relentless defense and sweet shooting; 14-for-31 from beyond the 3-point line. It continued with the sudden bursts of energy from all directions; Solomon Hill knocking down three deep 3-pointers early and reserve guard Ian Clark, crushing his former team for 18 points, including daggers down the stretch. It was punctuated by Davis and Holiday grinding away like the guys who fueled the Pelicans\u2019 first-round sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers, and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo breathing as much verbal fire as Green, while also driving the Pelicans with 21 assists, the first player with at least 20 in a playoff game since he did it in himself in 2011 when he was with the Boston Celtics. The Warriors simply couldn\u2019t keep up. And Curry didn\u2019t the have the same touch or adrenaline he had in his playoff debut in Game 2, when he torched the Pelicans for 28 points in 27 minutes off the bench during his first action after missing nearly six weeks with a knee injury. \u201cMost of it is attributed to the Pelicans,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cTheir defense was great. They were the aggressors. I thought they brought the force, the necessary force to the game on their home floor, and these are the ebbs and flows of a playoff series, especially when you get past the first round. Everybody is really good and that\u2019s a team that just swept Portland in the first round and on their home floor down 2-0, this is kind of what you expect.\u201d Gentry has unleashed all that. When the Pelicans lost All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending Achilles injury in late January, the framework for this team had to be altered completely. The Pelicans had to lean on Davis to dominate the way he did Friday night (33 points on 15-for-27 shooting, 18 rebounds, four steals and three assists). Holiday (21 points, seven rebounds, five assists) had to be set free to resume the All-Star ways he showed earlier in his career. And Rondo needed the keys to the car and the freedom to guide the Pelicans\u2019 young stars to the edge the way he has throughout this postseason, complete with at least two more face-to-face skirmishes with Green Friday night. \u201cThat\u2019s the way he plays, he talks a lot of \u2026\u201d Rondo said after being informed that Green suggested he was trying to bait him into a confrontation. Rondo, who joined Magic Johnson and John Stockton as the only players in NBA history with multiple 20-assist games in the postseason , understands the process a team must go through to reach that next level. He was a young point guard in Boston when he learned it from Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Doc Rivers during the Celtics\u2019 2008 title run and the years they spent as a contender after that. And he knows success at this stage is more about the Pelicans and what they do than it is about any beef, real or perceived, between he and Green. \u201c It definitely is, but it starts with defense, \u201d  he said.  \u201c We were able to get some stops, defensively. It \u2019 s hard to run and keep pace when you \u2019 re taking it by the net every time which we did in game one so we cleaned up a little bit better in game two and three and look forward to making adjustments for game four. \u201d Without Gentry understanding and trusting that same process, and facilitating the perfect environment for all of his players, especially his three biggest stars, this Pelicans team could have easily fallen out of the playoff mix in a wild Western Conference. That race that went down to the final night of the season for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets and affected the seeding for every team after the No. 1 Houston Rockets and No. 2 Warriors. Gentry had to empower Rondo to infuse the right kind of bite in both Holiday and Davis, whose voice grows louder with each game \u2014 he didn\u2019t hesitate to make a statement in a second half huddle Friday night, barking to his teammates that \u201cwe are not going to lose this game.\u201d \u201c That was the message, \u201d  he said.  \u201c We can \u2019 t lose this game. It \u2019 s always tough to come back from 0-3. Our mindset is to go out there, play, and do what we \u2019 re supposed to do from all the game planning. Whatever results happen, happen. We followed the game plan to a T tonight. \u201d And now the real fun begins. The atmosphere will be electric for Sunday afternoon\u2019s Game 4. The expectations will have changed dramatically for the Pelicans in just a few hours. Can they do it again? Will they exhibit the same appropriate fear against a championship Warriors team that will be smarting from a Friday night dose of their own medicine? Gentry, the architect of this perfectly brewing storm, is counting on it. Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

This year that guy is Baylor\u2019s Nuni Omot. It\u2019s open for debate as to what constitutes a sleeper. But in our definition of the term, a player must possess the following qualities: \u2022 At least one NBA-level skill. \u2022 High character. \u2022 Work ethic. \u2022 Perseverance. We\u2019ll start with the obvious. Omot can shoot the rock. And at 6-foot-9 with a 7-foot wingspan and above-average athleticism, he can shoot it over pretty much anybody. Consider the numbers. In the 2017-18 season, Omot shot 43.3% from behind the 3-point arc, fifth in the Big 12 Conference . Perhaps more impressive in a league where coaches are sticklers for defense, Omot shot 48.1% during league play. That led the conference. \u201cHe can shoot,\u201d Baylor assistant coach John Jakus says. \u201cHe can really, really shoot. Our [director of basketball operations] Bill Peterson was in the NBA for 12 years and has been working him out pre-draft. Nuni\u2019s hitting numbers from three that very few guys can hit. Guys that are all stars.\u201d Peterson, who was a Milwaukee Bucks assistant for six seasons, a player development coach for the Dallas Mavericks and a head coach in the G-League, was impressed with Omot\u2019s tools. \u201cAt the end of the year, Nuni came to me and said \u2018coach, I know you\u2019ve been in the league,\u2019 \u201d Peterson says. \u201c \u2018You know me, and you know what\u2019s expected. What do I need to do?\u2019 \u201d Peterson and Omot went to work. The first order of business was to forget the college 3-point line ever existed and move back a few steps to the NBA line. Omot mastered the deeper range fairly quickly. Then his workouts became more refined. \u201cI\u2019ve treated him like an NBA player,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cFundamentally, there were things we could help him do to get his shot off quicker. If you think about Ray Allen, Rip Hamilton, Kyle Korver, guys like that, they come off a pin down [screen] and get it off right away. We\u2019ve worked on that with Nuni, and he\u2019s gotten better and better and better.\u201d Peterson has also encouraged Omot to incorporate a shot fake with a couple of dribbles. \u201cThen he can put his body into [his defender] and lean back and score the ball,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s learning to get it down and up quickly into the shot pocket.\u201d Omot isn\u2019t afraid of hard work. As a junior, he played sparingly. Omot knew that in order to get on the floor more, he\u2019d have to improve his shooting. \u201cI could shoot it a little bit,\u201d Omot said. \u201cBut last summer, I worked on my shot like crazy. I lost count of how many shots I put up, but I worked and worked, just trying to become more consistent.\u201d Omot shot 31% from three as a junior and averaged 11.2 minutes a game. In his final season, Omot\u2019s playing time (23.8 mpg) shot up as drastically as his 3-point percentage did. On to character, which in Omot\u2019s case must be analyzed concurrent with his perseverance. It comes from his family members, who nearly 22 years ago were forced to leave their native Ethiopia, then engulfed in civil war. Omot\u2019s father, mother and brother trekked more than 400 miles to Kenya, on foot mostly and finding rides when they could, often at night so they wouldn\u2019t be spotted. The Omots had some family in Sioux Falls, S.D. and hoped to quickly receive visas to move to the United States. But they spent three years in a Kenyan refugee camp, where conditions were poor, disease rampant and food scarce. That\u2019s where, in 1994, Omot was born. In 1996, Omot, his mother, Pillow, and brother Aba were allowed into the U.S. But his father, Kwot, was forced to stay behind for medical reasons. Omot\u2019s mother worked hard to ensure her sons could establish a life in their new home. He\u2019s never forgotten that. \u201cHer desire, and her passion for me and my brother,\u201d Omot says. \u201cWhen we got to the U.S., she started working. What she had to go through was unbelievable, something you would see in a movie. All the thousands of miles she had to travel to find a home for her family.\u201d Omot\u2019s first love was football, even though he was thin. He was fast and had good hands, which made him a good receiver. But then came a growth spurt, and it became apparent Omot was going to have to make basketball his primary sport. By his own admission, Omot was so clumsy at first, he nearly gave up the game. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run without tripping over my feet,\u201d he says, laughing at the recollection. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make a move without falling over. I wanted to quit so badly. I was just terrible. But somehow, I continued to trust in the process.\u201d The family settled in Minnesota, where Omot attended Mahtomedi High School. He played well in his senior season, but didn\u2019t receive an NCAA Division I scholarship offer, so he began his college career at Division II Concordia University in St. Paul, Minn. Omot redshirted his first season, then averaged 12.4 points and 5.5 rebounds as a freshman in 2014-15, shooting 58 percent from the field and 42 percent from 3. Still thinking he could play Division I, Omot transferred to Indian Hills (Iowa) Community College, a junior college powerhouse. After averaged 12.2 points and 5.4 rebounds and starting 33 games, Baylor offered a scholarship. Forced to sit out the fall semester of 2016 because of academic reasons, he saw action in 25 games the rest of the season. His stats were modest, prompting the hard work he put in during the summer of 2017. Omot\u2019s senior season didn\u2019t play out exactly as he\u2019d hoped, but he was able to prove beyond a doubt he could play college basketball at its highest level. And there was a surprise at the end. Since leaving Kenya as an infant, Omot hadn\u2019t seen his father, nor did he have any recollection of him. Kwot Omot was stranded in Africa, unable to make the transition to the U.S. one day, Omot\u2019s brother surprised him with some news. \u201cHe told me my father was going to come to America, but he didn\u2019t know when,\u201d Omot says. \u201cThe night before my senior night at Baylor, my brother said, \u2018let\u2019s go to the gym, I\u2019ve got to pick something up.\u2019 I walked into the gym, and my dad was at center court . He just broke down. It was very emotional. I\u2019d never seen him before, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see him.\u201d Omot\u2019s father attended Baylor\u2019s senior night and is now working in South Dakota. Now Omot, wants to find his way onto an NBA roster, in part because he knows he\u2019s good enough, but in part because of his family that battled through seemingly insurmountable obstacles to be together. \u201cI\u2019d love to make it to where my mom doesn\u2019t have to work anymore,\u201d Omot said. Is his dream possible? Is this ultimate sleeper really NBA material? \u201cIf you look at him, he\u2019s what the NBA is trending to,\u201d Jakus said. \u201cIf they can figure out what position he guards, and he does that at a high level, then you know what he can do at the other end. He\u2019s going to space the floor with his shooting and drive closeouts and get to the rim. He\u2019s got the three-part of the three and D down now. And I think the rest will come.\u201d Peterson would have loved to have coached Omot in the G League. \u201cHe\u2019s a prototype guy for me,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got great length, he\u2019s athletic, and he can shoot the ball so well. Let me have this guy for a year, get him a ton of reps, and you\u2019ve got something.\u201d Chris Dortch is the editor of the  Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

McConnell at point guard. If winning this particular game was his first priority, that\u2019s what Brown should have done. McConnell \u2013 the Sixers\u2019 undrafted, 6-foot-2 back-up \u2013 was having one of the best games of his life on the biggest stage he\u2019s ever played, registering eight points and five assists (with no turnovers) in 17 minutes. He was a pest defensively, picking up a pair of steals. He was aggressive on offense, taking Aron Baynes off the dribble for a big bucket early in the fourth. \u201cMcConnell was ridiculous,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said afterward. \u201cHe was a big reason why that game ebbed back towards them.\u201d Indeed, in a game that the Sixers led by 22 in the second quarter and trailed by eight late in the third, McConnell was a well-earned plus-16. After the Celtics called timeout with 6:59 left in the game, with the Sixers up three, Brown had McConnell back on the floor. But as soon as Boston inbounded the ball, Sixers rookie Ben Simmons was on his way to the scorer\u2019s table to check back into the game. And when there was no dead ball over the next seven possessions, Brown called timeout so he could sub Simmons for McConnell and Joel Embiid for Ersan Ilyasova. At that point, the Sixers were up two, but had been outscored by 16 points with Simmons on the floor. The Kia Rookie of the Year favorite had taken just two shots, unable to do any damage against a Celtics defense that had kept him from getting to the basket. McConnell was the better player on this night and the better option to play down the stretch. But Brown was playing the long game and this was a learning experience for one of his young stars. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision, I admit it,\u201d the coach said about taking McConnell out in favor of Simmons in the fourth. \u201cThis whole playoff experience is something that I want our young guys and our star players to learn from and grow. The decision \u2013 do you go with T.J. still or do you come back to Ben Simmons? \u2013 I\u2019m coming back to Ben Simmons. I\u2019m coming back to Ben. He\u2019s had a hell of a year. I think he\u2019s the Rookie of the Year. I think he\u2019s going to have to learn how to play in these environments.\u201d The decision may have cost the Sixers the game. Simmons missed another two shots down the stretch as Boston outscored the Sixers 17-10 after the point he checked back in. It was another display of the Celtics\u2019 resilience and a 108-103 victory that gave them a 2-0 series lead. It was also the worst game of Simmons\u2019 postseason career. He finished with one point and seven assists, shooting 0-for-4 from the field and committing a game-high five turnovers. He was a minus-23 in a game his team lost by five points.  \u201cI\u2019m going to have bad games,\u201d Simmons said afterward. \u201cIt happens. Obviously, it\u2019s not the perfect timing.\u201d He\u2019s still a rookie, but this is the rookie who averaged a triple-double as his team went 20-1 over the last 16 games of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs. There were no bad games in that first round series against the Miami Heat , who, according to Simmons, were more physical than these Celtics. \u201cPhysically,\u201d Simmons said, \u201cthe Heat were on another level.\u201d Physical or not, the Celtics are the better defensive team. They\u2019ve been able to get back in transition and wall off the paint. If they\u2019re not more physical than the Heat, they\u2019re bigger. In this series, Simmons\u2019 primary defenders have been 6-10 Al Horford and 6-9 Marcus Morris, both bigger than any Heat player who defended Simmons for more than 15 possessions in the first round. \u201cHe\u2019s really hard to guard with a smaller player,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s so big and strong and shifty. We\u2019re fortunate to have a bunch of bodies to be able to kind of rotate guys.\u201d Against Simmons \u2014 who has scored a grand total of 64 points (on 25 percent shooting) from outside the paint in 88 games this season \u2014 there\u2019s a clear game plan: stay in front of him and contest his drives as best you can. The Celtics have executed that game plan about as well as any team could have, and Simmons\u2019 inability to shoot from the perimeter has been a clear factor in the 2-0 hole in which Sixers find themselves. \u201c[The Celtics] are elite guarding their own men,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s a physicality and switch-ability that they got apples for apples on many, many different matchups.\u201d Boston gave Simmons nothing in transition on Thursday, and then Simmons gave his team nothing in their half-court offense. Boston dared him to shoot and he didn\u2019t take the bait. But he also couldn\u2019t get position for the post-ups and duck-ins that he\u2019s been able to take advantage of all season long. He looked tentative. \u201cI think it was mainly what I did to myself,\u201d Simmons said, not giving the opponent much credit. \u201cI think, mentally, I was thinking too much, over-thinking the plays. I wasn\u2019t just out there, flowing, playing the way that I play, which is free. I think, obviously, I know what their game plan is. I\u2019ve got to play my game.\u201d He\u2019ll have that opportunity back at home on Saturday and Monday. And even if Games 3 and 4 aren\u2019t his best, they\u2019ll be two more experiences from which to learn and grow. T.J. McConnell was the better player in Game 2, but Ben Simmons is the franchise cornerstone. And even with a playoff game on the line, Brett Brown had his eyes on the future. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Only it wasn\u2019t Michael Jordan or any other NBA legend being mentioned for comparison\u2019s sake. It was Babe Ruth. Like the Bambino (or allegedly so), James called his shots Thursday. That\u2019s how Kevin Love termed it, anyway, sharing afterward that some of the improbable, breathtaking fadeaway shots James rained down on the Raptors in a Cavs-dominant second half, his superstar teammate actually talked about at the morning shootaround. \u201cThis morning, you could just sense it,\u201d Love said. \u201cHe knew what was at stake. He knew that us getting another one here at their place was going to be huge for us.\u201d It\u2019s one thing for James to carry the Cavaliers offensively through part of all of a game with his usual array of power drives, dunks, free throws and face-up 3-pointers. It\u2019s quite another for him to pummel a defense the way he did the hapless Raptors. James hit seven fadeaway jump shots in the second half, during which he scored 27 of his game-high 43 points . He scored four buckets in a row near the start of the final quarter, when Cleveland pushed its lead to 105-87. An 18-5 run to start the third quarter had put the Cavs in control, but James\u2019 assault from multiple angles was almost mocking in its impact during the Cavaliers\u2019 128-110 victory. \u201cJust all the shots over his right shoulder, the step-backs, the fadeaways,\u201d Love said. \u201cYa\u2019 know the one where he hit the \u2018moonball\u2019 over his right shoulder and came back the next possession and hit one over his left shoulder from the free-throw line, that was special.\u201d It was stupid-good and lethal, James taking advantage of mismatched Toronto point guard Kyle Lowry as his ostensible defender. And here\u2019s where the Babe comes in: James had tipped Love to his intentions eight hours earlier at the morning walk-through session. \u201cHe said when he got the mismatch, he was going to do that,\u201d Love said. \u201cSo, he actually called his shots this morning. \u201cThat\u2019s just one of the, I guess, examples I could use for how locked in he was.\u201d Ladies and gentleman, the Sultan of Shots. Now, there\u2019s still some mystery about what Ruth did or didn\u2019t do nearly 86 years ago in the fifth inning of Game 3 of the 1932 World Series between his Yankees and the Cubs in Chicago. He was, depending on the account, a) talking trash to pitcher Charlie Root, b) razzing players in the Cubs\u2019 dugout for how the team cut his buddy Mark Koenig\u2019s World Series bonus money, or c) telling the world he was about to deposit a Root pitch into the Wrigley Field bleachers. In this updated 2018 version, James was a) anticipating some defensive switches by Toronto that would allow him the clean looks at the basket he got, b) challenging himself by dialing up the degree of difficulty of his attempts or c) preparing to cut the heart out of the Raptors and their fans with a barrage so staggering as to drain any fight for what\u2019s left of the series. \u201cUnderstanding my defenders, understanding what they\u2019re trying to catch,\u201d James said later. \u201cFor me, just being able to have counters. \u2026 I gave [Love] a little insight of my mind, and I showed it tonight.\u201d The days of daring James to shoot jumpers are long past, though that might still be the tactic of last resort. He is unstoppable on the move, a sure-fire \u201cand one\u201d at the rim and the equivalent of the old-school bangers in the post. So, you get him to turn his back 15 feet or more away from the basket, stick tight as he turns and fires in one motion from various points on floor, and hope for the best. Pity the Raptors, who were saddled with the worst. James finished with 43 points on 19-of-28 shooting with eight rebounds and 14 assists. That made him the first player in NBA playoff history to go for 40 and 14 in a single game. And that\u2019s what Toronto was dealing with. James had set up Love, Jeff Green and the others so effectively with his passing, the Raptors didn\u2019t dare show him a parade of double teams to pick apart. That meant Lowry, DeMar DeRozan and OG Anunoby got attacked and, from the look of it anyway, toyed with. \u201cThat drains you mentally and physically,\u201d Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. James\u2019 takeover felt, in the building, like nothing less than the Cavs star finding and shifting into a \u201cBye Toronto, see you next fall\u201d gear. Casey said that, in spite of James\u2019 drone strikes, his team got \u201cbogged down\u201d and, for the second time in as many games, didn\u2019t push the pace hard enough, long enough. The Raptors led by as much as nine points deep in the second quarter but couldn\u2019t push it onto double digits; by halftime, it was 63-61 and the Cavaliers smelled weakness. That\u2019s where Toronto is now, down 0-2 after dropping home games, desperate for traction that won\u2019t come easy at Quicken Loans Arena in Games 3 ( Saturday, 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC ) and 4 ( Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET, TNT ). \u201cYou have to keep fighting,\u201d Casey said. \u201cNo one is going to feel sorry for us.\u201d Embarrassed, maybe. Love got a lot of attention from Cleveland faithful for his 31 points, 11 rebounds and 21 shots, all vital signs for that team\u2019s second All-Star. His inconsistent play in the first round against Indiana \u2013 where Pacers forward Thaddeus Young stifled him repeatedly \u2013 left too much of the heavy lifting for James, a risky way to push through two months of postseason toward their Finals goal. But after contributing in parts of Game 7 Sunday against the Pacers and the opener Tuesday against the Raptors, Love returned in full this time. Since Serge Ibaka is being sized up for goat horns through two games \u2013 not GOAT status \u2013 Love\u2019s post-up opportunities against overmatched C.J. Miles seemed pulled from his Minnesota 20-20 days. \u201cHe wanted the ball, demanded the ball and we got it to him,\u201d James said. \u201cI made shots,\u201d Love said. He did. But no one made shots Thursday quite like James. Or called them. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He walked the streets downtown and later found himself soaking up the history that clings to the championship banners swaying above the TD Garden court. \u201cIt almost feels like I belong here,\u201d Fultz said at the time. It turned out to be nothing more than a field trip when the Celtics surprised many and passed on selecting Fultz with the No. 1 overall pick. They instead traded it to the 76ers for the third pick, which they used to grab Jayson Tatum, and a future first-round pick. Right now it looks like a good move for Boston. The Celtics have a 1-0 lead over Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Tatum has been a revelation on a team battered by injuries. Tatum\u2019s role first increased when Gordon Hayward went down with an ankle injury, then again following Kyrie Irving\u2019s knee surgeries late in the season. Tatum has responded to every challenge, averaging 17 points, five rebounds and three assists in his first postseason. \u201cI enjoy it,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI dreamed of having big moments and having a big role. That obviously came a lot sooner than I thought. I\u2019m just trying to prove that I belong here.\u201d Fultz is not having nearly as much fun. He has been reduced to a spectator after a down regular season that saw him go through shooting issues and miss 68 games with a shoulder injury. And this after having his shot dissected during the season. But he insisted that he hasn\u2019t let any of it frustrate him. \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me really,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI was just happy with the team\u2019s success. That\u2019s all I\u2019m about.\u201d He finally returned for some game action during the final 10 games of the regular season. But it wasn\u2019t until the final night of the season that he provided his best example to date of the potential that the Sixers spent so much capital to draft. Fultz looked at ease for the first time in months when at 19 he became the youngest NBA player to record a triple-double, registering 13 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds in a win over Milwaukee. Yet, while Boston is embracing Tatum, Fultz is still looking to make a meaningful postseason impact. After playing 24 minutes over the first three games of the first round, Fultz was inactive in the final two games of the Miami series and didn\u2019t play in the opener against the Celtics. He isn\u2019t only playing behind Rookie of the Year candidate Ben Simmons, but Fultz is also watching T.J. McConnell get minutes. Sixers coach Brett Brown said the decision to sit Fultz hasn\u2019t come without some second-guessing. He left room for the former Washington Huskies guard to make an appearance in this series. \u201cIt\u2019s my decision to go with T.J.,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere are times that you for sure think about it. But to say (Fultz is) dead and buried, that\u2019s not true. But I got a decision to make. And I\u2019ve made a decision. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s etched in stone. It\u2019s always something you review and think about. And the care for Markelle Fultz and his future is always on my mind.\u201d Fultz said he\u2019s ready to contribute in whatever way he\u2019s asked. \u201cAnything for the team, I\u2019m just here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I get an opportunity I\u2019m just going out there and play my hardest.\u201d After the Celtics beat the Bucks in Game 7 to advance to the semifinals, Tatum was asked what he learned about himself playing in his first playoff series. \u201cI love what I do,\u201d Tatum said. I love being out there. It\u2019s fun.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling that, for now at least, Fultz has only gotten in a small dose. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all an opportunity,\u201d Fultz said. \u201cWhen the coaches put me out there, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be ready for.

Do the Utah Jazz have another one in them? There\u2019s no reason to doubt the fearless, short-handed Jazz after they toppled the Houston Rockets in Toyota Center Wednesday with a 116-108 win in Game 2 over the Western Conference\u2019s No. 1 seed, evening up this semifinals series at 1-1. The Jazz led by 19 before halftime, surrendered that advantage and trailed by five in the third quarter before re-taking control with a decisive 16-2 run late to shock the Rockets and snatch home-court advantage with Games 3 ( Friday, 10:30 p.m. ET, TNT ) and 4 ( Sunday, 8 p.m. ET, TNT ) this weekend in Salt Lake City. \u201cThat to me was maybe the most important thing in the game,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said of his team\u2019s resilience. \u201cTo get off to a good start and play well and then you know they\u2019re going to come back. It\u2019s just a question of how far and how quickly, and I thought they cut the gap and not only made it a game, but basically took control of the game. \u201cI think we could feel that. At that point, for our guys to keep their focus on what we\u2019re trying to do, and continue to run and continue to shoot and try to defend says a lot about the team and how they function together and that they didn\u2019t break at that point.\u201d Playing into May wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the cards for this Jazz team that lost All-Star Gordon Hayward to the Boston Celtics in free agency. Only six players returned from the fifth-seeded squad that knocked off the LA Clippers in the first round of 2017 and got swept by the eventual-champion Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals. There weren\u2019t necessarily any playoff expectations for this team at the start of training camp. But no one told rookie guard Donovan Mitchell, who has led the Jazz all season and keyed their upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games in their first-round series. Mitchell shot just 6-for-21 in Game 2, filling in for injured starting point guard Ricky Rubio, but showed up every time the Jazz needed him. He registered five assists in the first six minutes as the Jazz took control, finishing with 17 points, a career-high 11 assists, five rebounds and a jaw-dropping dunk on his own missed floater in the fourth quarter that helped ignited his team\u2019s game-closing run. \u201cJust being poised and staying under control was the biggest thing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cUnderstand how they were going to guard me and when you have the big fella (Rudy Gobert) rolling as fas he did, making the right plays to kind of predict what the defense was going to do next.\u201d Clearly no one mentioned to Joe Ingles, one of those six veteran holdovers from last season, that a playoff run was not in the cards for 2018. He smoked the Rockets for a career-high 27 points in Game 2, draining 10 of his 13 shots, including a 7-for-9 showing on 3-pointers. Ingles also nailed two key 3-pointers in the final five minute to help hold the Rockets off. \u201cJust sticking together and just keep executing,\u201d Ingles said about what carried the Jazz down the stretch. \u201cWe knew they were going to make runs. So just sticking together, I think we did a really good job of that and we were able to make our runs when it was our turn.\u201d It was the sort of group effort that has been the trademark of this Jazz team all season. Mitchell and Ingles served as the catalysts for an inspired bunch that jumped on the Rockets early, took the home team\u2019s best retaliatory shots, and then pounced at the finish. Their confidence in each other and their teammates was obvious after two days to study how to attack the Rockets after that Game 1 drubbing. The Jazz bench nearly doubled up their Rockets counterparts in scoring (41-22). They got a career night from Alec Burks (17 points, six assists), a double-double from Jae Crowder (15 points and 10 rebounds) and quality work on both ends of the floor from Dante Exum. It was Exum\u2019s driving dunk with 55.3 seconds to play closed the door on any hopes the Rockets had of a last-minute comeback of their own. \u201cI thought Dante\u2019s dunk was better than mine,\u201d Mitchell said. The Jazz hit a franchise playoff-high 15 3-pointers and finally beat this Rockets team that had owned them in the five games (all wins by 11 or more points) the squads had played entering Game 2. It was the game Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni had been dreading as his team eased its way into this postseason. By many accounts, they played three outstanding quarters in the five games it took Houston to oust the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round . They led the Jazz by 27 points in Sunday\u2019s opener but watched that lead dwindle to just 11 points after halftime, as the Jazz found some cracks in the Rockets\u2019 improved defense down the stretch. D\u2019Antoni warned his team about thinking they could flip the switch in the postseason after winning a league-best 65 games in 2017-18. The real wake-up call didn\u2019t come until now. \u201cYeah, we flipped it,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe came back from 19 down. We flipped it and then they flipped it back on us. You\u2019ve got to give them credit, they played great down the stretch. They hit shots, they did what they were supposed to do.\u201d The Jazz did exactly what they did to the Thunder in the first round. They studied the film from their Game 1 loss, made the necessary adjustments and won Game 2. In the end, it lead to an ousting of OKC in six games and the Thunder never enjoying the home-court advantage they earned that series. Duplicating that feat against these Rockets should prove to be a much tougher task, especially without Rubio (who was one of the most animated individuals on the Jazz bench all night while rocking Mitchell\u2019s signature rookie sweatshirt). His hamstring injury might force Mitchell to continue working at the point for the remainder of the series. It remains to be seen, though, if that\u2019s an advantage for the Rockets. For all the work Kia MVP frontrunner James Harden (32 points, 11 assists and six rebounds) and teammate Chris Paul (23 points, five rebounds and three assists) did in Game 2, neither one of them could will their team to a Game 2 win as Mitchell did for the Jazz. \u201cThey were just too comfortable,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey were getting layups, dunks, free throws, a little bit of everything. We fought back hard. But give them a lot of credit, they did what they were supposed to do. They came in here and got a win.\u201d The pressure is on the Rockets now to do the same in Utah. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Knowing where the extra defender typically plays means knowing which teammate has been left unguarded. Which in turns means a big, juicy open shot, assuming the dribbler can pass or swing the ball in that direction. Sometimes, though, knowing where the help is coming from isn\u2019t hoops jargon at all and means exactly what it says: Who the heck is going to help out the guy or guys already carrying the group on his back? That had been a specific problem for the Cleveland Cavaliers as the 2018 NBA Playoffs got underway. LeBron James was playing great, but the other Cleveland players were unproven, unreliable or, at their worst, both. And unless someone emerged as a consistent sidekick from among the Cavs\u2019 veteran role players and playoff newbies, Cleveland\u2019s designs on a fourth consecutive trip to the Finals looked to be as doomed as James\u2019 personal quest of making it there eight straight years. Well, in their 113-112 overtime victory in Game 1 on Tuesday at Air Canada Centre, the Cavs, the Raptors and the world learned where James\u2019 help was coming from. And where it might continue to be sourced as this Eastern Conference semifinal series plays on. James\u2019 best helpers in the series opener, as in Game 7 of the first-round series against Indiana, were familiar faces. With considerable playoff experience, not merely individually but as part of this Cleveland crew. Maybe with a few gray hairs. They were guys most familiar with James, the Cavs\u2019 system and the style of play \u2013 long on deference and patience \u2013 that maximizes his outrageous bundle of skills. Notably against Toronto on Tuesday, it was J.R. Smith, best known in previous stops for knucklehead antics but embraced with this bunch for his uncanny long-ball accuracy and a fairly recent commitment to individual defense. Smith scored 20 points, hitting 5-of-6 3-pointers in Game 1. It was Kyle Korver, 37-years-old and a guy who has conformed his game to fit James\u2019 in the 16 months he\u2019s been with Cleveland. Korver scored 19 and kept pressure on Toronto simply by popping open time and again (he took 17 shots) for potentially lethal opportunities. And it was Tristan Thompson, whose time with the Cavs pre-dates this second run of LeBron. Thompson sparked Cleveland as a surprise starter in Game 7 against the Pacers on Sunday, getting 15 points and 10 rebounds to pose an extra headache for the Indiana defense. This time, the 27-year-old big man came off the bench for 14 points and 12 rebounds. Nine of his boards were on the offensive end, creating second chances and extended possessions to wear down the Raptors. Thompson also brought a defensive counter to Raptors center Jonas Valanciunas, who had dominated Kevin Love inside and wasn\u2019t slowed all that much by sub Jeff Green. Reps from previous playoff encounters came in handy for Thompson, and Valanciunas went from a 19-point scorer through three quarters to a fellow who shot 1-for-7 in the fourth quarter and didn\u2019t even attempt one in overtime. Green chipped in 16 points and even Love, the All-Star still not playing like one, improved after halftime with five points and eight rebounds. The point wasn\u2019t just that they played well. It was that they cut James some slack on a night he wasn\u2019t all that sharp. The league\u2019s best player did post a triple-double and did score 26 points, but he missed 18 of his 30 shots, including seven of eight 3-pointers. He also bricked five of his six free throws \u2013 and earned only six. \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t as efficient as I would like to be,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is to try to get a win, and my teammates were unbelievable. They stepped up when I wasn\u2019t at my best.\u201d There was a side benefit as well. The first wave of Cleveland role players took some glare off the second wave, namely Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, George Hill and Larry Nance Jr. They\u2019re the guys who arrived in February, the ones still adjusting and learning how to blend their skills and styles into what it means, as the saying goes for 30 franchises, to play \u201cCavaliers basketball.\u201d \u201cEvery system is different,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Wednesday morning. \u201cIf you come in late in the season, it is tough to grasp everything in such a short amount of time. But the guys have done a good job of just trying to catch up and get up to speed.\u201d And that\u2019s swell. Except this is the postseason, when moving too slow along a learning curve can mean falling off completely. Considering James\u2019 load of minutes and, in the half court anyway, responsibility for initiating nearly everything his team does offensively, Cleveland might have been doomed if his more established crew \u2013 Smith, Thompson, Korver, Love \u2013 hadn\u2019t asserted themselves soon. Remember, Toronto has what generally is regarded as the best bench in the NBA. Yet help from a couple starters enabled James to log positive minutes with some backups and the Cavs\u2019 bench wound up winning that battle, 37-35. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep chipping in as much as we can,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe can\u2019t play Superman every night.\u201d Said Lue of Smith, who appears to have cut back on his occasional haywire moments that can be so costly: \u201cJ.R. is really great in the playoffs for us because we give him one assignment \u2013 he usually has [to defend] the best perimeter player \u2013 and he really does a good job of locking in.\u201d Apparently, there was no separate team meeting or a gathering of the LeBron James lack-of-support group that got several fellows unstuck. But they know their roles, both when they\u2019re filling them and when they are not. \u201cY\u2019know, this is how we play,\u201d said Korver. \u201cLeBron has the ball and we play off of him. We have to do a better job. \u2026 When we kind of bog down is when the ball stops moving and the bodies stop moving. As long as we do that, we usually find some shots and some looks.\u201d Korver\u2019s remarks were deliberate, making clear he understands the Cleveland dynamic: This is LeBron\u2019s team. Everyone else \u2013 now that Kyrie Irving and Isaiah Thomas are gone \u2013 conforms their impressive and varied basketball skills to suit his. Period. \u201cThere\u2019s not been a ton of discussion,\u201d Korver said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t shot the ball great as a team yet. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to help him out, right? He plays a ton of minutes, he\u2019s carrying a big load. But this is how we play. It\u2019s not gonna change.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And though both of these teams ranked in the top three defensively and in the middle of the pack on offense, it\u2019s also a contrast of styles, apparent with the pace that both teams played at in Game 1. On Monday, the Celtics had one more possession (95) than the Sixers (94). But, according to Second Spectrum tracking, Boston had the ball for almost six more minutes than Philly did . Having the ball longer isn\u2019t necessarily an advantage. In fact, it may be a disadvantage more often than not. League-wide, effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the shot clock and goes down as the clock does. Defenses want to force those shots in the last six seconds of the clock and offenses want to avoid them. In Game 1, the Sixers took just three shots in the last six seconds of the shot clock. The Celtics? 24. And they were 13-for-24, including 6-for-10 from 3-point range, in the last six seconds of the shot clock. The 24 attempts was almost double their regular-season average of 12.6 per game. The Celtics took 15 percent of their shots in the last six seconds of the shot clock, right around the league average, in the regular season. But the playoffs have been a different story. In their eight games, the Celtics have taken 28 percent of their shots in the last six seconds of the shot clock, by far the highest rate in the postseason (the Cavs have the second highest rate at 23 percent). The Celtics have become comfortable living late in the clock. And more than anything, it\u2019s been out of necessity. For one, the Celtics don\u2019t have Kyrie Irving, the guy on their roster with the most ability to generate good shots for himself. In many cases, especially against switching defenses, the Celtics go late in the clock because their early-clock pick-and-rolls don\u2019t create enough of an advantage to produce an open shot. The opponents have also had something to do with it. Priority No. 1 against the Milwaukee Bucks? Keep Giannis Antetokounmpo out of transition. Priority No. 1 against the Sixers? Keep Ben Simmons out of transition. Playing slow and deliberate is a strategy against particular opponents. The Celtics led the first round in time of possession , and they\u2019re on their way to doing it again in the conference semis. Of course, 13-for-24 and 6-for-10 from beyond the arc (an effective field goal percentage of 67 percent) is unsustainable. The Celtics had an effective field goal percentage of 47 percent in the last six seconds of the shot clock in the first round, and that was better than all but one team (Cleveland \u2013 49 percent) that shot in the last six seconds in the regular season. Both of Aron Baynes\u2019 3-pointers in Game 1 came late in the clock. Shane Larkin, 7-for-26 on pull-up 3-pointers in the regular season , hit a step-back three with two seconds on the clock late in the third quarter. The Celtics obviously can\u2019t depend on shots like that going forward. But they can depend on Al Horford, who, time after time on Monday, was patient and under control in late-clock situations. In some cases, Horford had the ball in his hands, and worked to manufacture a shot, against Dario Saric \u2026 or against Joel Embiid \u2026. He also drained a late-clock jumper off penetration from Terry Rozier. And in one late-clock situation, a timely cut from Horford drew enough attention from the Sixers\u2019 weak-side defenders to free Rozier for a catch-and-shoot three . There\u2019s a lot of young talent in this series, but the experience and patience of the Celtics\u2019 veteran big man made all the difference in Game 1. The best way to keep your opponent out of transition is to execute offensively, and the Celtics do that much better when Horford is in the game. Through eight playoff games, they\u2019ve scored 110 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor and just 102 with him off the floor . In the regular season, those numbers would have ranked sixth and 27th in the league , respectively. Game 2 on Thursday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), promises to be a lot different than what we saw in Game 1. The Sixers have some mistakes to clean up and may change their defensive assignments so that J.J. Redick isn\u2019t defending Jayson Tatum. That\u2019s easier to do if Jaylen Brown is still out (he\u2019s listed as doubtful with a strained hamstring) and Marcus Smart remains in the starting lineup. The Celtics had success on drives against both Redick and Marco Belinelli (scoring 21 points on 12 possessions) in Game 1. The Celtics probably won\u2019t shoot as well as they did on Monday. But pace will continue to be a battle in this series and it\u2019s clear that Boston has become comfortable playing late in the clock. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Ball shot 55 percent from the field and 41 percent from 3-point range during his lone season at UCLA \u2014 those numbers dropped to 36 percent and 30.5 percent , respectively, in year one with the Lakers. His free throw shooting was a poor 45 percent as well. There were plenty of bright spots for the 20-year-old, however.

He and Ben Simmons became the first rookies to average at least six rebounds and seven assists since Magic Johnson in 1979-80. His defense and impact in the passing lanes was a positive, grabbing 1.7 steals a game, tied for best among rookies.

The traditional end-of-pregame-practice heave from the tunnel at Oracle Arena, with an assist from an usher, was nailed on the first take. The double chest-pound and index finger pointed to the heavens was executed perfectly. The poor mouthpiece got the bubblegum treatment again and was munched aggressively without mercy or compassion. And one particular time, when he parachuted to the court after taking a jumper, he struck a crouching pose \u2014 his trademark move when celebrating something special \u2014 and the troublesome knee that kept him benched since early March did not creak. Oh, as for the most important sign of all for the Golden State Warriors: Curry\u2019s shot was splashy and all seemed complete in his (and their) basketball world once again. Yes, Curry\u2019s return in Game 2 of this Western Conference semifinal series inspired the Warriors in a 121-116 victory Tuesday . But also, perhaps, it did so for the Pelicans because Game 2 carried a measure of suspense into the fourth quarter. If the Pelicans ( who were blown out in Game 1 ), are feeling better about themselves now, the Warriors are, too \u2014 for one obvious reason. \u201cJust him walking on the floor, you know, it was kind of electric in here. Pretty fitting, for sure,\u201d said Warriors forward Draymond Green. Curry had 28 points on eight-of-15 shooting in 27 minutes. He was good from the very first aim, which he took mere seconds after he checked into the game with 4:20 left in the first quarter. He sank a 3-pointer off a Kevon Looney screen from the left wing that set the tone for his night. In his limited time, Curry was active, frisky, aggressive and clearly restless after sitting out since March 23 and watching the playoffs begin without him. He felt free and unburdened, showing no limitations from his left MCL sprain or the weeks of inactivity. To date, the Warriors had coasted through the playoffs, breezing by the San Antonio Spurs in five games and routing the Pelicans in Game 1 . I would say it played out as I expected. He was Steph. He doesn\u2019t take long to warm up, that\u2019s for sure. \u201c Warriors coach Steve Kerr, on Stephen Curry There was no reason to rush Curry back to a team that has All-Stars Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green as reinforcements. Yet the deeper the Warriors went in the playoffs, the more they had to get Curry some reps if only to shake off any rust. Once he was medically cleared and the Warriors had reason to uncross their fingers, there was no need to extend Curry\u2019s agony. \u201cIt was an eternity, it felt like for sure,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI had to pace myself and be patient with it. I was real eager to get out there with my teammates and do what I love to do. It was a good feeling, the crowd was crazy and we did what we needed to do in these first two games.\u201d With Curry playing again, a sense of normalcy returns as well for Golden State. The floor is spaced more now and there\u2019s no need to continue with the well-meaning Andre Iguodala experience at point guard. Durant likely won\u2019t see as many double-teams and Thompson should get more open looks. Curry is the rare player who changes everything, both for his team and the opposing one. His shooting is a weapon in and of itself, but there\u2019s also his passing and occasional rim-attacking. All of this makes the Warriors a championship contender for the fourth straight postseason. \u201cIt\u2019s his ability to get easy baskets for us,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI think he uplifted the crowd as well. That was fun to hear the ovation he got. And he just bailed us out when we got stagnant. We missed him, I was happy we went 5-1 (in the playoffs) without him and it\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr cleverly kept Curry out of the starting lineup just in case the Warriors started slowly. And, sure enough, the Warriors needed his energy \u2014 New Orleans was up 18-11 before Curry\u2019s first basket. \u201cPerfect timing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe had a tough first quarter and everything changed once he stepped on the floor.\u201d For most of the first three quarters, though, the Pelicans were sharper and quicker. They had 39 fast-break points (to Golden State\u2019s 24) and managed much easier baskets than in Game 1. The Pelicans clearly planned to spoil the moment. All five starters scored in double figures and Anthony Davis , Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo (who was not surprisingly left open for long jumpers) each scored more than 20 points . This was how the Pelicans flourished after the season-ending injury to DeMarcus Cousins, and it\u2019s what they\u2019ll need to master for Games 3 and 4 in New Orleans. \u201cWe knew New Orleans was going to come out at us,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe were not ready for their force. We didn\u2019t play intelligently down the stretch. We played well to win but we\u2019ll have to play better in New Orleans.\u201d The Pelicans didn\u2019t take advantage of Thompson\u2019s 4-for-20 night . And Durant did not heat up until the fourth quarter ( he was 6-for-17 before that ). The Warriors appeared vulnerable if only for fleeting stretches, yet never lost control. Green flirted with a second-straight triple double, finishing a rebound short. He keyed the Warriors\u2019 fourth-quarter run with a pair of 3-pointers. Green also had a testy exchange with Rondo at halftime that didn\u2019t escalate into anything that would involve the referees, but did spice up the atmosphere. Green said that was his plan all along. \u201cI just had to bring some force,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were playing soft. We needed to bring some intensity to the game. That\u2019s my job. I had to bring some competitive spirit to the game and after we did that, we took off.\u201d Curry\u2019s return is also what the Warriors needed now. The playoff road only gets tougher from here, with a series shift to New Orleans and many projecting a Western Conference finals meeting with the Houston Rockets. This is the Warriors, now complete with Curry. They\u2019re now ready to return to the style and level of play they knew before he fell awkwardly, reached for his knee and hobbled off the floor. It\u2019s fair to say that Curry is healthy again and so are the Warriors\u2019 chances of repeating as champions. \u201cI would say it played out as I expected. He was Steph,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t take long to warm up, that\u2019s for sure. Steph\u2019s worked really hard over the last six weeks to prepare for this.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

As our own David Aldridge pointed out in his latest Morning Tip, the next move by the Spurs and their star forward, Kawhi Leonard, will have a big impact on summer roster shuffling as well . The quadriceps injury that ultimately sidelined Leonard for all but nine games this season led to news of reported tension between he and the Spurs. But Leonard made it a point in March to clear the air and denied talk of friction between he and the team . However, the concern about Leonard\u2019s future and his willingness to stay with the Spurs remains a popular topic among the team and its fans. According to ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne and Michael C. Wright, the Spurs have worries that those close to Leonard may be trying to steer him to a bigger-market team : Over the past several months, ESPN has spoken to dozens of league sources, people close to Leonard and Spurs staffers. They describe a confounding situation, with mistakes made on both sides, and a looming showdown between one of the NBA\u2019s most prestigious franchises and one of the best players in the league who has never really flexed his muscles in this way, but just might have the power to alter the NBA landscape. \u2026 Multiple league sources also told ESPN that the Spurs have grown worried that Leonard\u2019s group has an ulterior motive to fray the relationship and get Leonard traded to a larger market like Los Angeles (Leonard\u2019s hometown) or New York or Philadelphia (Leonard\u2019s uncle, Dennis Robertson, lives in New Jersey). One source close to general manager R.C. Buford said the longtime executive admitted to him that he\u2019s constantly losing sleep over how and why the relationship with Leonard has disintegrated. Talk of a potential Leonard trade no doubt causes angst among the Spurs\u2019 faithful. However, Jabari Young of the San Antonio Express-News reports that no such discussions have taken place between Leonard and the Spurs : Though the ESPN story suggested Leonard\u2019s uncle, Dennis Robertson, is pushing for a trade to a big market, those close to Leonard told the Express-News no trade conversations with the Spurs or internally have taken place. Leonard\u2019s camp has not decided what route to take. They are waiting for the Spurs to decide they will offer Leonard the supermax. If that occurs, Leonard\u2019s camp will then decide if they will accept the offer after repairing any damage with the team, which is partly due to what they believe was a misdiagnosis of Leonard\u2019s right quad leading to the current injury. Also, within Leonard\u2019s camp, there has been a feeling of dissipating support from the Spurs tied to leaks about his whereabouts while rehabbing, leaks about the Spurs\u2019 doctors clearing Leonard to play, and describing Leonard\u2019s medical team as \u201chis group\u201d \u2014 a term frequently used by Popovich. In addition, ESPN reports that Leonard\u2019s camp has its own feelings as to why Leonard\u2019s injury was such a nagging one in 2017-18 for the former All-Star and Finals MVP: Leonard\u2019s camp believes his condition is the result of a series of contusions to the quadriceps that began with one very deep bruise in March 2016 that caused him to miss three games. Leonard was again listed with a \u201cquad contusion\u201d on the Feb. 6, 2017, injury report, when he was a late scratch before a game. But it wasn\u2019t until the end of last season when the severity of the injury became apparent. According to multiple sources, Leonard\u2019s camp has come to believe the issue has more to do with an ossification or hardening in the area where the muscle has been repeatedly bruised and then an atrophying, which in turn affected the tendons connecting the muscle to the knee. The Spurs have always called the injury quadriceps tendinopathy, which is a disease of the tendon that has a degenerative effect on the muscle by keeping it in a constant state of exhaustion. Once the Spurs season came to an end in Game 5 of the first round, reports surfaced that the Spurs wanted to schedule an all-hands-on-deck meeting with Leonard and the team\u2019s brass . Leonard missed all but nine games this season while nursing right quadriceps tendinopathy, an injury that flared up late in the offseason. He returned to the team\u2019s lineup briefly but did not come back again after complaining of soreness in his injured thigh following the Spurs\u2019 home win over Denver on Jan. 13. After the Spurs lost Game 1 of their first-round series with the Golden State Warriors, Leonard opted to remain in New York to work with his own team of doctors to further rehab his quadriceps injury. Leonard went to New York to work with his own team of doctors for the second time in 2017-18, after first working with them prior to the All-Star break in February. The Spurs\u2019 medical staff has been present for both of Leonard\u2019s extended stays in New York to stay updated on his progress. The 6-foot-7 forward has worked out at the NBA Players Association facility in Manhattan during both of his stays in New York. The Spurs\u2019 99-91 loss to the Warriors in Game 5 of the first round set in motion a summer for the Spurs that may feature several well-known players coming back \u2014 or moving on. After the loss, Spurs fan-favorite and former All-Star Manu Ginobili was at the point he was after last season\u2019s loss in the West finals to the Warriors: deciding what to do about his future . The swingman is under contract for 2018-19, but he said Tuesday night he is weighing what\u2019s next in his career. \u201cAs I\u2019ve done it the last two or three seasons, I\u2019ll sit back, relax and, after two or three months, see if I feel retired or not,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cI like to let it season a little bit, to see how I feel. Don\u2019t expect news until July, probably. I just don\u2019t know. I let a month, two months go by and see how I feel. I\u2019m not the type of guy who makes decisions on the fly, and when you are upset, hurt or whatever.\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has endured plenty of late, as he has been grieving the death of his wife, Erin, who died last week after a prolonged illness . He did not coach in Games 3, 4 or 5 ( Spurs assistant coach Ettore Messina handled those duties ). Popovich has coached the team since 1997-98 and is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA. He will also be coaching Team USA before the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Longtime Spurs point guard Tony Parker is also a free agent this summer. He said last summer he hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would require the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray this season and remains open to returning to San Antonio. Other players, such as Danny Green and veteran swingman Rudy Gay, face contract decisions this summer. Big man Pau Gasol \u2014 who is under contract for two more seasons \u2014 made it clear after Game 5 that he plans to keep playing, too. \u201cI have plenty of gas in the tank,\u201d Gasol told reporters after Game 5. \u201cI feel like I can do a lot of good things on the floor and play three years, three, four years. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind. But, knowing that, I also take it one year at a time. I go step by step and try not to look too much into the future because a lot of factors come into play.\u201d"},{"id":46962,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-detroit-pistons-want-stan-van-gundy-back-changes","date":"2018-05-02","title":"Report: Detroit Pistons want Stan Van Gundy back, but with changes","content":" When the Detroit Pistons\u2019 season ended, coach Stan Van Gundy and team owner Tom Gores were slated to meet to discuss the future of the team\u2019s coach .

According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Van Gundy and Gores recently met and the owner is willing to keep Van Gundy around. But, he is looking to make changes to the front office, which is something Van Gundy may not be open to : Van Gundy has one year left on his deal and engineered the February trade with the LA Clippers for former All-Star forward Blake Griffin. Although Detroit got off to a hot start with Griffin, the Pistons stumbled down the stretch and missed the playoffs for the second straight season and third time in four seasons. Overall, Detroit was 39-43 this season, but went 8-4 when point guard Reggie Jackson and Griffin played together. Additionally, the Pistons were 27-18 with Jackson, who suffered a severe ankle injury in late December and did not return until late March .

If the Toronto Raptors wore their psyches on the outside, the whole NBA world would see the scars and blemishes that have been inflicted over the past three postseasons by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Instead, we\u2019re left only with manifestations of the damage done, again and again. So many stitches, unseen but undeniably there. Having already been eliminated from the playoffs by them in both 2016 and 2017, the Raptors\u2019 streak of postseason losses to the Cavaliers reached seven Tuesday. Cleveland came from 14 points down to win in overtime, 113-112 , and grab a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals series . This defeat surely counted double, maybe even triple, given the advantages and the urgency DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry and the rest of the Raptors had coming in against their nemeses from northeast Ohio. And how thoroughly they squandered them all. That home-court advantage at Air Canada Centre for which Toronto had worked so long and hard across six months and 82 regular-season games? Gone. The Cavaliers had trudged through customs Monday as a tired team, pushed to seven games by Indiana, while Toronto had earned itself some rest by shedding Washington in six. Didn\u2019t matter. James and a supporting cast that actually provided enough for a change hung around through an early deficit, strung together buckets and stops when needed, and frankly got lucky with the number of good looks the Raptors bricked. A team that ranked third in offensive rating (111.0 points per 100 possessions) and fourth in true shooting percentage (57.5) shot 8 of 31 in the fourth quarter and overtime, scoring just 25 points in those 17 minutes. Against a defense rated next-to-last in the NBA (109.5 points per 100). The most glaring example of Toronto\u2019s struggles not just at putting the ball through the basket but in terms of seizing the opportunity in Game 1 came near the end of regulation. Finally caught in the game\u2019s 48th minute by James\u2019 turnaround jumper from the right side to tie at 105-105, the Raptors got an open 3-pointer from reserve Fred VanVleet and then \u2014 in rapid succession, each a bit closer to the rim \u2014 failed putbacks by a falling DeRozan, by Serge Ibaka and by big man Jonas Valanciunas. VanVleet got one more hero-or-no-hero shot at the end of overtime, missing from nearly the same spot with 3.4 seconds left. As he tugged his jersey up and flinched over his failure, the piano on his and his teammates\u2019 backs got that much heavier. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was nerves or yips or what,\u201d Toronto coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cA lot of things we did to ourselves.\u201d That\u2019s where the Raptors\u2019 legacy stands. They now must win four out of six games against a team that has them down 2-9 since the start of the 2016 East finals (with a couple more thumpings in the final weeks of this regular season as glimpses of hard times to come). Tyronn Lue, the Cavs coach, was delighted afterward and didn\u2019t run from the idea that his team stole the Game 1 victory. \u201cConsidering the circumstances, we definitely stole one,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we played our best game. I think they know that as well.\u201d Notably, that includes James, who needed 30 shots to score his 26 points and went 1 for 8 on 3-pointers and 1 for 6 from the foul line. Of course, the Cavaliers star chipped in 11 rebounds and 13 assists for the 21st triple-double of his playoff career. But he wasn\u2019t sharp, he looked and played tired, and the Raptors let that slip through their hands. Asked directly about the degree to which he and his teammates are in the Raptors\u2019 heads, beating them before the opening tip, James talked instead about the short turnaround time between surviving against Indiana on Sunday and plunging into this series against Toronto. He did, however, answer a subsequent question in a way that seemed a bit more pointed toward a Raptors team suffering from LeBronchitis. \u201cWe knew we were going to get their best shot today,\u201d James said. \u201cThey knew we didn\u2019t have much rest. They knew we didn\u2019t have much preparation. They\u2019ve kind of been waiting around for us. \u2026 Just tried to make things happen at the right time.\u201d DeRozan and Lowry still sounded feisty enough, avoiding the defeated and deferential tones that came from them near the end of last spring\u2019s sweep by the Cavaliers. But what they say and what we see hardly could be more different. It was Lue making the game\u2019s strategic masterstroke, running in Tristan Thompson to disrupt and bother Valanciunas out of his comfort zone. The 7-foot Lithuanian had feasted on Kevin Love and Jeff Green through three quarters, posting 19 points with 16 rebounds. But with Thompson on him, Valanciunas managed just two more points with five rebounds in nearly 13 minutes. And it was Cleveland getting a more complete game overall, a group effort worthy of a legit contender. Worthy of the team they\u2019ve been in reach the past three Finals. J.R. Smith drained five of his six 3-point shots and scored 20 points. Kyle Korver logged nearly 38 minutes, put up 17 field goal attempts and scored 19. Green scored 16 points, Thompson added 14 and Kevin Love at least grabbed 13 rebounds (on a 3-for-13 shooting night). That vaunted Toronto bench scored 35 points but the Cavaliers were better with 37. That\u2019s a good night for a bunch of role players whose competency and character got questioned every time James went for 44 or 45 points in the first round. Now it\u2019s the Raptors \u2014 the players, the coaches and the higher-ups \u2014 hearing folks\u2019 doubts and trying not to think of 59 victories and the team\u2019s considerable stylistic changes as fool\u2019s gold. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A hard pick here leads to an errant elbow there and before you know it, the bad blood is boiling and tempers flare. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll even have an old school playoff skirmish, the kind that was routine in a bygone era. But not these Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz, who are struggling to conjure up some genuine disdain for one another. In fact, they can\u2019t stop gushing about each other. From Jazz coach Quin Snyder\u2019s affection for Rockets stars James Harden and Chris Paul to the universal love the Rockets have expressed about Jazz rookie wunderkind Donovan Mitchell, the mutual admiration forming in this Western Conference semifinal is beyond cordial. Snyder described Harden\u2019s game in artistic terms Monday and said basically there is no way to stop him, a sentiment Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni agreed with Tuesday. \u201cYou can put a list of about 28 other teams that don\u2019t have an answer, either,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no answer. He might play bad because he\u2019s human, but there\u2019s nothing that you can conceivably come up with to stop him.\u201d But D\u2019Antoni also praised Mitchell, insisting that after a spectacular rookie season and just seven playoff games that he\u2019s one of the \u201cbest players in our league.\u201d Old school types would have to cover their eyes and ears as these two teams continue to size each other up. They want to beat each other in the worst way, of course. And they\u2019ll be sure to go at each other with everything they can muster in Game 2 of this series Wednesday night at Toyota Center. The mutual respect, however, is likely here to stay. Memories run deep on both sides, the connections more sacred than any temporary disdain for one another that might reveal itself during the course of this battle for a trip to the conference finals. Rockets veteran Joe Johnson played a critical role for the Jazz team that knocked off a L.A. Clippers team in seven games, the same team that Paul and Luc Mbah a Moute played on before joining the Rockets last offseason. Mbah a Moute hasn\u2019t forgotten the masterwork Snyder put in during that series. That\u2019s why he\u2019s expecting more of the same this time around. \u201cTheir coach is unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for him. His game plan adjustments are amazing and his in-game adjustments during a series are amazing. Going against him last year, seven times, I can tell. I know how many times they changed from game to game. And every time we did something defensively he would come back with a counter for it, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to have some stuff for our switches [on defense]. \u201cYou could tell a little bit in the second half,\u201d Mbah a Moute said when asked if he noticed any mid-game adjustments in Game 1. \u201cThey started throwing the ball to [Rudy] Gobert a little bit more and having Chris and smaller guys in that position where they had to either wrap him up or foul him. So yeah, I think it\u2019s going to be even harder to play better and defend better because they are going to make some adjustments, and some pretty good ones. It\u2019s going to be a good challenge. I know that from playing them last year, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Paul has served as a mentor and sounding board for Mitchell during his breakout rookie season, but informed him before Sunday\u2019s series opener that all their communication in the immediate future would come on the court. He wasn\u2019t as eager as Mbah a Moute to make the connection between this current Jazz team and the one that ended his Clippers tenure last season. \u201cWas Donovan there, was Ricky Rubio there?\u201d he said, pushing back on a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cThat\u2019s a totally different team. Gordon Hayward was there. Joe Johnson was there \u2026 and now he\u2019s with us. That [team] doesn\u2019t have nothing to do with this.\u201d Save, of course, for plenty of the other players on the Jazz who did play in that series. Gobert, who serves as the backbone of the Jazz defense, is certainly an easily identifiable link. \u201cYeah, you still got Rudy there, so you still have him there back in the lane,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think they know us pretty well and we know them pretty well. But that\u2019s it.\u201d What they know of each other based on four regular season match-ups and Game 1, all of those games the Rockets won by 11 or more points, gives both sides a reason to be wary. Even with their success, the Rockets know that this Jazz team has been vetted by their season and that first-round series upset of the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games. And instead of coming down off of an emotionally exhausting series just 36 hours before Game 1, they\u2019ll show up for Game 2 having had two days to rest, study and prepare to deal with the Rockets. \u201cI think they are going to play with a lot more energy,\u201d Rockets forward Trevor Ariza said. \u201cIt\u2019s more time between games for them. They got time to go back and study film of how we played them and what they did well. We just have to continue to play with high intensity for us, and play hard for as close to 48 minutes as we can.\u201d *** Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

In some ways, the Golden State Warriors will be complete Tuesday and ready to start a \u201cnew\u201d season, one with a healthy Stephen Curry in the lineup and without the sense of boredom and complacency that the loaded defending champions had to sludge through the last few months. Curry went through a slight scrimmage against bench players on Sunday, which was an off-day for the team, and apparently aced the test. After doing so again on Monday, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters that Curry is \u201cprobable\u201d for Game 2. On Tuesday afternoon, the team made it official and said that Curry is expected to play tonight vs. the Pelicans . An argument can be made that we haven\u2019t really seen the true 2017-18 Warriors, although sooner or later, that team was destined to show up and not-so-gently remind the remaining NBA playoff teams what they\u2019re up against. As Kerr said: \u201cWe needed stakes. And now we have high stakes.\u201d Just a few weeks ago, the good-natured coach fell in and out of foul moods regarding his team. There was a good reason for that. Players slept-walked through games, the Warriors were sloppy defensively and the NBA bully was being poked in the eye. Much of this was due to human nature. When you\u2019re built for spring and summer basketball because of four All-Stars in their prime, a January game in Sacramento doesn\u2019t quite generate a sense of urgency. The Warriors could play at 80-percent peak and still win 50 games. That made biggest enemy of the Warriors \u2014 with all due respect to the hungry Houston Rockets \u2014 the 82-game grind. It became tedious, in some ways unnecessary and in the case of Curry, a minefield that required a careful tip-toe through, or else. Well, he suffered \u201cor else.\u201d His left MCL injury kept him benched for six weeks and that was preceded by an ankle sprain. So, again, the regular season was just standing in the way. Now, there\u2019s just the Pelicans, down 0-1 and about to get first crack at a three-time NBA Finalist that is suddenly woke, ready and (seemingly) fully healthy. \u201cFrom that window up there (in his office overlooking the practice floor), I had one eye on the game tape and one eye on Steph,\u201d Kerr said Monday. \u201cHe came out if, he came out of it well, he went through the whole practice today and I\u2019d be very surprised if he didn\u2019t play.\u201d Kerr refrained from making Curry\u2019s status for Game 2 official yesterday, only because of the admittedly minor chance of an unexpected last-minute setback. The other reason to play Curry in this series, even though the Warriors won Game 1 in blowout fashion, is to whip him into game shape now. There\u2019s also the unmentioned but obvious reason: Better to get Curry ripe for the next round and a projected showdown with the Houston Rockets than to wait until then. \u201cHe needs rhythm,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cThe only factor in terms of allowing him to play is his health. He\u2019s ready to go. Now it\u2019s a question of rhythm and how much time to give him. That\u2019s important. He needs to get his groove back.\u201d Kerr said there will be no minutes restriction with Curry, explaining that the guard is \u201cin a good place\u201d with his knee. If anything, Kerr will simply use good sense while monitoring Curry in Game 2, whom Kerr expects to perform with little or no rust or performance issues. \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about him,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him come back from injuries many times. I remember in late December he had 41 points in 30 minutes against Memphis. I remember a couple years ago in the playoffs against Portland he went 0-for-10 and made a three and did a shimmy. As I told him he was the only guy ever in the history of the NBA to do a shimmy when he was one-for-11. But he made his next five. That\u2019s who Steph is. \u201cIt\u2019s really about his rhythm and if he gets tired we\u2019ll take him out. He\u2019ll want to get his legs underneath him, so we\u2019ll find the balance between being cautious and letting him go a little bit.\u201d In addition to Curry\u2019s pending return, Kerr is thrilled with the other signs of life and rejuvenation within the Warriors. The team appears perky, antsy and much more aware. The fog has been lifted, or at least it was through much of the first round and one game into the second round. There\u2019s a sense of heightened awareness about the approach of May and the rewards that come with moving forward. Kevin Durant was perhaps the lone Warrior who looked immune from the late-season doldrums and remained on a high level. And Durant ( who is averaging 27.8 ppg in the playoffs ) still hasn\u2019t developed the slightest hint of a slump since the playoffs began. Durant can expect to see less attention on him once Curry gets a rhythm, which means Durant could actually be more productive than he is right now, or at least more efficient. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll change it up defensively a bit on me, but we\u2019ll see what they do and how they respond,\u201d he said. \u201cSteph will help spread the floor and open even more spaces. There could be some advantages, but we don\u2019t know right now. I\u2019ve seen every defense that\u2019s ever been created at this point.\u201d Klay Thompson is spitting fire right now; he\u2019s making half his shots from inside and beyond the 3-point stripe in the playoffs and destroying defenses while coming off screens on catch-and-shoots. Meanwhile, Draymond Green is an assist shy of averaging a triple-double through the playoffs. Kerr believes Curry will give the Warriors an extra bounce and suspects the sloppy and disinterested Warriors are a team of the past. \u201cSteph always brings that joy,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe loves to play so much. It\u2019s contagious. Putting him in the mix will only increase our momentum.\u201d It\u2019s a steep challenge for the Pelicans to keep up, both with the recharged Warriors and the pace of play. Once DeMarcus Cousins suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, New Orleans switched to a higher gear offensively and used the rebounding of Anthony Davis and the court vision of Rajon Rondo to trigger the fast break. This is what saved their season and helped them sweep the ambushed Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. However: Portland\u2019s defense was not on the Warriors\u2019 level, which is bad news for Nikola Mirotic, who had open looks against the Blazers, and Jrue Holiday, who roamed freely and often unchecked. Those two averaged 18 and 28 against the Blazers but combined to shoot seven-for-23 in Game 1 of this series. The Warriors also feel relieved that they\u2019re playing a team with a similar up-tempo style compared to the Spurs, whose deliberate half-court crawl offense slowed the flow and gave the Warriors fits in the first round. \u201cThis is the way we like to play,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cThe Spurs, that was hard.\u201d No matter what the Warriors do or what big shot is made, or the A-list courtside celebrity is shown on the big overhead screen \u2014 it was Jay-Z and Beyonce in Game 1 \u2014 the largest ovation will be for a two-time MVP when he checks into the game Tuesday. * * * Curry is ready to return and to a championship level and more important to Golden State, his teammates might have already beaten him to that door.

The Grizzlies did not disclose terms Tuesday of Bickerstaff\u2019s new deal. He will be introduced at a news conference Wednesday. Bickerstaff was the associate head coach when Memphis fired David Fizdale in late November of his second season. Guard Mike Conley had season-ending surgery to repair his left heel and Achilles tendon, and the Grizzlies finished the season at 22-60 for the second-worst record in the NBA behind only Phoenix. They had to win their regular season home finale to avoid the worst record since relocating to Memphis for the 2001-02 season. But they should wind up with their highest draft pick since 2009. \u201cJ.B. did an admirable job as interim head coach last season in what was a challenging set of circumstances,\u201d general manager Chris Wallace said in a statement. \u201cJ.B. has connected with our players and earned their respect throughout his time in Memphis, and we have been pleased with his role in developing our young players. We are excited to see him coach with a full offseason and a healthy roster next season.\u201d This will be the first time Bickerstaff has been hired as head coach without an interim tag. He finished the 2015-16 season as the interim coach in Houston after Kevin McHale was fired, and he went 37-34 with the Rockets. Bickerstaff said at the end of the season that he had been discussing his future with management and wanted to return. \u201cI feel like we have started something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have started to build a culture. You want to be part of a group that you like. I think there\u2019s going to be a tremendous bump next year, health permitting. I would love to be a part of it.\u201d Conley is expected back healthy, and the Grizzlies still have center Marc Gasol with a handful of young players like Dillon Brooks who got plenty of playing time under Bickerstaff. Bickerstaff also was an assistant coach with Minnesota between 2007 and 2011 and worked for his father, Bernie, with the Charlotte Bobcats between 2004 and 2007. He was director of operations for the University of Minnesota men\u2019s basketball team after playing two seasons.

They\u2019re tough. They\u2019re a great defensive team.\u201d In the first round, the Miami Heat shot just 5-for-19 at the rim when Embiid was there to protect it. So Baynes, the Celtics\u2019 6-foot-10 brute of a center who has made four 3-pointers in 376 career regular season games, was often spaced beyond the 3-point line to, hopefully, give his teammates some space to drive. But if he was going to be out there, if his teammates were going to pass him the ball, and if Embiid had no intention of venturing out to defend him, Baynes was going to shoot. He did so three times, making a pair from the corners. And that was how it went for the Celtics on Monday. The No. 1 defensive team in the league had a remarkable offensive performance without three of its best offensive players against another top-three defense. Boston shot 17-for-35 from 3-point range on its way to a 117-101 victory in Game 1, improving to 5-0 at home in the playoffs. The Celtics have been without Gordon Hayward since the first game of the regular season and without Kyrie Irving for the past seven weeks . And to open the conference semis, they were without Jaylen Brown , who had the team\u2019s two highest scoring games (34 and 30 points) in the first round against Milwaukee and suffered a right hamstring strain in the first half of Game 7 on Saturday. Apparently, the Celtics have to sacrifice a player for every step forward they take this season. There was little doubt the Celtics would still defend, but how they were going to generate offense against the Sixers without Brown was the question. And it was still a question midway through the second quarter, with the Celtics having scored just 30 points on their first 34 possessions of Game 1. But then the floodgates opened. Starting with a Semi Ojeleye 3 in transition, the Celtics scored 26 points on their next 13 possessions to take an 11-point lead into the half. The onslaught continued in the second half (56 points on 42 possessions before garbage time kicked in) and the Sixers never had a chance to make it interesting. There was certainly an element of randomness. Marcus Smart (27 percent on pull-up 3s in the regular season) drained a 3-pointer off the dribble that Dario Saric was happy to let him shoot after a switch. Ojeleye, who got the second-quarter run started, was 3-for-12 from 3-point range in the first round. \u201cBaynes hit a couple,\u201d Sixers guard J.J. Redick said afterward. \u201cSome of it was just not our night.\u201d The Sixers also had no answer for the brilliance of Al Horford, the Celtics\u2019 offensive fulcrum who had Philly wrapped around his finger for most of the night, scoring 26 points on 10-for-12 shooting and adding four assists. He took advantage of mismatches when he got them and double-teams when they came. When he played center against Embiid, he spaced the floor and drained a pair of 3s himself. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s really locked in,\u201d Stevens said of Horford. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job of knowing when to roll and post and play an interior spot, and then knowing when to pop and space.\u201d The Celtics also attacked the Sixers\u2019 weak links. Philly defended Jayson Tatum (6-foot-8 and athletic) with Redick and Marco Belinelli (6-foot-4 and 6-foot-5, respectively, and not-so-athletic), matchups that elicited an aggressive streak from the Celtics\u2019 rookie, who finished with a career-high 28 points, getting to the line 12 times. \u201cFor different reasons,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said, \u201cwe decided to do that [matchup]. And we\u2019ll go back and see how that worked.\u201d And finally, the Sixers just weren\u2019t the same team that had won 20 of its previous 21 games. Robert Covington, one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, got lost on back-to-back possessions in the second quarter, giving Terry Rozier (who finished with a career playoff-high 29 points) an open corner 3 when he got caught ball-watching and Tatum a layup on a botched off-ball switch. \u201cThe defense was just bad tonight, all around,\u201d Redick said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute our game plan. We didn\u2019t communicate well. On the ball, I thought we did a decent job, but the other stuff really hurt us.\u201d Philadelphia took a step backward after a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season and an impressive five-game dispatching of the Miami Heat in the first round. \u201cThis was a very poor game from us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cTo think that this game is a reflection of what we\u2019ve been doing the past few months would be a mistake.\u201d In some ways, it wasn\u2019t an accurate reflection of the Celtics either. Their offense won\u2019t come so easily every night. The Celtics scored less than a point per possession in three first-round games against a worse defensive team than the one they\u2019re facing now. And Aron Baynes certainly isn\u2019t a 67 percent 3-point shooter. In some ways, however, this is exactly who the Celtics are. They figure out a way to win regardless of who is or isn\u2019t available. \u201cNo matter who is out there,\u201d Rozier said, \u201cwe are going to play hard and we are going to pay attention to details and take care of business.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Everything else is on the table. The Miami Heat president said Monday in his annual end-of-season assessment that no player on the team\u2019s roster will be considered untouchable this offseason \u2013 if the right deal presents itself, that is \u2013 but quickly added the caveat that the franchise is not looking for a total revamp after going 44-38 in the regular season and making the playoffs. \u201dShow me the right name, and I could be all-in on everything,\u201d Riley said. \u201dYou know me. But it\u2019s got to be the right name \u2026 that doesn\u2019t happen very often. Our core guys, we would like to keep together, there\u2019s no doubt. We would like to keep them together and we\u2019d like to add something to it, but that\u2019s going to be a challenge.\u201d He also was clear on his own future: The 73-year-old Riley, who has spent a half-century in the NBA as a player, coach and executive, isn\u2019t going anywhere until managing general partner Micky Arison tells him it\u2019s time to vacate the president\u2019s office. In other words, the Hall of Famer\u2019s competitive fires are still burning. \u201dThere\u2019s always something that brings you back in,\u201d Riley said. \u201dThere\u2019s something that sucks you back in. \u2026 I\u2019m an active participant, and I\u2019m going to stay that way to the chagrin probably of some of you and probably people in the organization.\u201d Riley held exit meetings with players Friday, three days after the Heat\u2019s season ended in a five-game first-round ouster at the hands of the Philadelphia 76ers . He said he hasn\u2019t yet broached the topic of retirement with Dwyane Wade, for fear of planting that seed. He reiterated that the team wants to try to keep Wayne Ellington, even with the Heat somewhat handcuffed right now by salary-cap and luxury-tax challenges. Miami has $111 million already committed to the as-of-now seven highest-paid players on its books for next season. And in the case of Hassan Whiteside, the enigmatic Heat center who was a nonfactor in the playoffs and complained about how he was being utilized by coach Erik Spoelstra, Riley made it clear that he wasn\u2019t happy with the entirety of the situation. Whiteside dealt with injuries during the season and didn\u2019t want to wear a knee brace that the Heat insisted upon, and Riley said that if Whiteside and Spoelstra need an intervention to solve their relationship issues \u2013 if any \u2013 he\u2019ll handle it. Riley also didn\u2019t mince words, saying Whiteside needs to make changes. \u201dBy the time we got to the playoffs I don\u2019t think he was ready,\u201d Riley said. \u201dHe wasn\u2019t ready. He wasn\u2019t in great shape. He wasn\u2019t fully conditioned for a playoff battle mentally. He, and we, got our head handed to us. The disconnect between he and Spo, that\u2019s going to take a discussion between them and it\u2019s going to take thought on the part of coach and also Hassan. \u201dHow will Hassan transform his thinking, 99 percent of it to get the kind of improvement that Spo wants so he can be effective? How can Spo transform his thinking when it comes to offense and defense and minutes or whatever?\u201d That word \u2013 transform \u2013 was a theme of sorts for Riley\u2019s meeting with reporters.

Come July 1, the Heat will be active on those fronts again \u2013 noting that the fan base is clamoring for more. \u201dWell, we\u2019ll give them more,\u201d Riley said. \u201dWe\u2019ll try to give them more.

After watching the film from Harden\u2019s 41-point, eight-rebound, seven-assist performance in Game 1, it\u2019s pretty obvious that one man alone has no chance of slowing down the Houston Rockets\u2019 superstar. Not even for men ideally suited physically for the task as the 6-foot-6, 235-pound Crowder and the 6-6, 225-pound O\u2019Neale appear to be. Monday\u2019s film study for the Jazz confirmed what their coach Quin Snyder thought in the immediate aftermath of Sunday\u2019s Game 1 loss, that it\u2019s going to take a communal effort to even attempt to knock Harden out of his comfort zone. And even then, there is no guarantee the Jazz will have any success against the man the entire basketball world has struggled with during what should soon be Harden\u2019s first Kia MVP season . So, without giving away any trade secrets, what\u2019s the best advice Snyder can provide for a planned attack for Harden in Wednesday\u2019s Game 2? \u201cYou ask him to miss,\u201d Snyder joked. \u201cYou say \u2018Please James, will you miss this time down.\u2019 And then you see if he\u2019s magnanimous enough to do you a favor.\u201d Jokes aside, if the Jazz are indeed going to make this a series against the postseason\u2019s No. 1 overall seed, they\u2019ll have to start by figuring out a way to at least slow Harden down one way or another. Allowing him to continue to impact games the way he has \u2014 he\u2019s rung up two 40-point outings in these playoffs and over six games is averaging 31.0 points, 7.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds \u2014 is simply a recipe for disaster, for any team facing the Rockets. That\u2019s why Crowder, the seasoned veteran, and the rookie O\u2019Neale are so important to the effort to curtail Harden\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cGoing into the series we said crossmatches were going to be a big thing,\u201d O\u2019Neale said, \u201cso really everybody is going to have their chance to guard him and you just have to make it tough on him and take away those shots where he likes getting them.\u201d The Toyota Center floor was Harden\u2019s playground in Game 1 as he dribbled and danced his way through the teeth of the Jazz defense at will, attacking them from all angles. But the film revealed that Harden made as many tough shots, contests shots, as he did anything. So, it wasn\u2019t all on the defense, or lack thereof. A lot of it was just a great offensive player doing what he always does. \u201cI give James Harden credit,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cHe made a lot of tough shots with a hand in his face. But I felt like we still could have done more, and we felt like as a group we still could do more on him in iso situations. They also made threes in transition, which we want to take out of the game completely, we want to take the threes out of the game as much as possible.\u201d Good luck with that. The Rockets have made 17 or more six times in franchise history, twice in this postseason and the sixth time being Sunday. Harden was 7-for-12 from deep in Game 1, his handy work from distance fueling the entire attack for the Rockets, which brings the conversation right back to where it started for the Jazz. Is there anything they can do to upset the order of things in Harden\u2019s world? \u201cLook, there\u2019s a lot of little things, that he\u2019s seen, because whatever you do a great player is able to adjust,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cSo, the value maybe is not something that you do consistently until he figures it out, but at least there\u2019s an opportunity there to create some indecision for him. So those are the things you try to look at. And sometimes you have to stay committed to something. You may do something well and he attacks it even better. It doesn\u2019t mean that what you are doing is necessarily wrong. But over time you get an indication of, whether analytically or otherwise, you do see certain. \u201cEvery match up is a little different, too, so things that we need to do, that we can do, might be different than some things that other teams can do. You know, we may have to keep throwing fastballs and just position them better as opposed to throwing a curve or maybe a change up, too. And there\u2019s your baseball analogy since we\u2019re in Houston.\u201d For the men on the frontline of trying to slow Harden and the Rockets down, the analogies, while cute in theory, just don\u2019t cut it. Crowder has the experience of dealing with the challenge of trying to impede the progress of an elite player, having worked against LeBron James while he was with the Celtics, which was before he worked alongside the Cavaliers superstar easier this season before being traded in the deadline day roster purge in Cleveland. He is well aware that what sound good in theory is often undone in the heat of the moment, especially when you are talking about an all-time great scorer. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to make it tough for him, give him different looks and don\u2019t let him get comfortable,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cYou can\u2019t let him get into a rhythm.\u201d Snyder is convinced that Harden\u2019s rhythm, that vibe he plays with when he\u2019s at his best, is what makes him so dangerous, so unique. It\u2019s what puts him in that elite category of all-time greats, a composition \u2014 usage rate, efficiency and assists \u2014 historically speaking, that ranks up there with the likes of LeBron, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. \u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d Snyder said of the way it feels to prepare for Harden, without committing to a direct comparison to Jordan, Bird or James. \u201cCertainly, he\u2019s a younger player so we\u2019re talking about guys who over a longer period of time have \u2026 but he just keeps getting better. And that\u2019s the thing to me that is really unique. \u201cIt seems like, he\u2019s artistic as you watch him play. It\u2019s pure, you know. And I think whatever his style is, it\u2019s Houston\u2019s style, and he adapts to the situation. There\u2019s an artistry to what he does on the court because he sees so many things that are going on and he has such an awareness \u2026 but certainly from a productivity standpoint and what he\u2019s done with their team, you don\u2019t see it.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

There were so many of them (279), a multitude of the spectacular, how-the-heck-did-he-do-that variety, that they began to boggle the mind, even distort reality. Crutchfield thinks his favorite came against Northwestern State or Northwestern. That\u2019s confusing enough considering the Sooners played them in consecutive games in late December. Add in the fact Young racked up 36 assists in those two games, including an NCAA-record tying 22 against Northwestern State, and it becomes even more difficult. But here\u2019s Crutchfield\u2019s recollection: \u201cWe inbound to Trae,\u201d Crutchfield says. \u201cKhadeem Lattin [Oklahoma\u2019s senior post man] was at the rim already. Trae takes the ball, doesn\u2019t even look and zips a one-handed pass between Khadeem and the [opposing team\u2019s] post guy, who isn\u2019t looking back. The ball might have even grazed his ear. Khadeem catches it and dunks it \u2014 a 55-foot pass, one-handed and dead on line.\u201d Kruger laughs when told that story. That\u2019s because it was typical Young. The 6-2, 180-pound magician dropped so many daring dimes like that one, it\u2019s hard to remember them all. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I remember one more than another,\u201d Kruger says. \u201cBut like Crutch said, one of Trey\u2019s best abilities was to move the ball ahead out of the backcourt. He would anticipate someone coming open early and deliver the ball actually before the cut.\u201d Little wonder that Young drew comparisons to Steph Curry while accomplishing things the former Davidson star and future two-time NBA MVP didn\u2019t even do in college. Young, who has deep range on his jump shot and the same quick-release, hairpin trigger as Curry, became the first player in NCAA Division I history to lead the country in scoring (27.4 ppg) and assists (8.7). As a freshman, Curry had that same unique ability to always be looking ahead, to see the floor and visualize, like a giant chess board, his next move. Or his teammates\u2019 next move. They had to be constantly on the lookout or risk getting a pass bounced off their skulls. And if Curry had to take matters into his own hands, just like Young, he could bury teams with deep 3-pointers. In his sophomore season in 2007-08, Curry made an NCAA record 162 3s in 369 attempts as he led the Wildcats to within a game of the Final Four. Basketball observers of a certain age were reminded when watching Young of another of the game\u2019s greats. There have been a number of great point guards in the college game in the last 40 years, prolific passers and playmakers who went on to great NBA careers. But some of the plays Young made, based on sheer imagination, daring and court awareness, looked an awful lot like Pete Maravich. Young was asked about that during the NCAA Tournament, his inquisitor wondering if Young had even heard of the Pistol. He had. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Young said, \u201cto even be mentioned in the same category or even the same breath with some like Pistol Pete Maravich. That\u2019s a legend right there \u2026 the things he [was] able to do on the court without a 3-point line was unbelievable.\u201d Young was clearly more impressed with the 3,667 points Maravich scored in just three seasons \u2014 an NCAA record established well before the 3-point goal was adopted into the game \u2014 than his passing ability. Young, who scored 876 points as a freshman, wouldn\u2019t have caught the Pistol with three more seasons like that. But Young\u2019s ability to take over a game with the jump shot or the pass made him special. Like Maravich, who played for his father, Press, at LSU, Young had a brighter shade of green light to shoot or try a seemingly impossible pass. \u201cWe gave him a lot of freedom,\u201d Crutchfield says. \u201cThat\u2019s [Kruger\u2019s] style with all his players. But he gave Trae a lot more because he could do so many things. With freedom, you get confidence, and Trae was like, \u2018I\u2019ll try this, and I\u2019ll try that.\u2019 Sometimes it didn\u2019t work out for him. A lot of times it did. But he wasn\u2019t looking over his shoulder, worried about coming out if he made a mistake.\u201d Because Young played in Oklahoma\u2019s backyard at Norman North High School, the Sooner coaching staff had the opportunity to watch him early in his career. Crutchfield remembers being impressed by Young\u2019s eighth grade season. \u201cThe thing that really stood out were his instincts,\u201d Crutchfield says. \u201cHe always ran through passes, stole the ball and got so many layups because he was so quick, so fast. But this was in Norman, Okla., against normal eighth graders, none of whom would go on to play Division I ball probably.\u201d But Young, whose father, Rayford, played point guard at Texas Tech and once scored 41 points against Kansas, began to develop a complete game. Ball handling was high atop his priority list. Like Curry, it became a weapon to create separation. Young\u2019s shooting improved to the point where, during his first two years of high school and AAU competition, he primarily played two guard. \u201cBut I remember,\u201d Crutchfield said, \u201chis dad telling me that he said to Trae, \u2018you\u2019re not going to be much taller than 6-1. There aren\u2019t many 6-1 two guards out there. You\u2019re going to have to turn yourself into more of a lead guard.\u2019 \u201d Clearly Young inherited some ability and court awareness from his father, but he went to work on his point guard skills, absorbing all the knowledge he could from his coaches and camp instructors and watching tapes of great point guards. \u201cI think to a certain degree you\u2019re born with the ability [to be a point guard],\u201d Crutchfield said. \u201cTrae\u2019s dad being a point guard, he had it in him. He just wasn\u2019t in position where he had to show it until later on. You don\u2019t all of a sudden go from a two guard to a point guard who\u2019s zipping balls through windows.\u201d Kruger knew the weapon he had before the season began, but he couldn\u2019t have expected the kind of year Young put together. He became the first power conference player in NCAA history to score more than 800 points and pass for more than 250 assists in the same season. He was just the second Sooner in history to win the United States Basketball Writers Association\u2019s Wayman Tisdale Award, given to the nation\u2019s top freshman. Appropriately enough, Tisdale was the first, well before the trophy was named in his honor. Young was also a consensus first-team All-American. Young\u2019s season had some low points, too. The Sooners lost six games in a row during the Big 12 season and finished with an 8-10 conference record. Some pundits criticized their selection to the NCAA Tournament, but the selection committee obviously gave considerable credit to the first third of Oklahoma\u2019s season, during which Young was doing his best Curry impersonation. As the losses mounted, Young began pressing more, seemingly trying to take the game into his own hands. He wound up launching 328 3-pointers. He committed 167 turnovers, an average of 5.2 per game. Through it all, Kruger remained as patient as he could. \u201cThere was a line there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe probably crossed it at times. Probably later rather than earlier. Earlier, we kept it in the positive column [assists to turnovers] by a lot. Then we got into conference play. We never could get it quite back in the bottle.\u201d The Big 12 is filled with tough, physical guards, and that\u2019s how teams began to play the spindly Young. And the harder they defended him, the more Young wanted to prove he was up to the task. The Sooners\u2019 offense might have revolved too much around Young at times. But Kruger wouldn\u2019t change a whole lot if he was given the chance to go back in time. The Trae Young Show was fun to watch, even magical at times. Young learned a lot during his only college season, from experience and his incessant film study. \u201cI\u2019m continuously watching film, watching film, a lot of guys, a lot of point guards,\u201d Young said during the NCAA Tournament. \u201cI watch a lot of film, a lot of old March Madness, and the old tournament games. I remember when Kemba [Walker, the Connecticut point guard] went off, Steph [Curry] went off in the tournament. I don\u2019t picture myself just doing what they\u2019re doing. I want to be a better version of me. I don\u2019t get too involved in that. I just want to be ready to play from the first game.\u201d Young\u2019s Oklahoma coaches don\u2019t doubt he\u2019s headed for an NBA career not unlike Curry\u2019s, depending upon where he lands in the NBA Draft. Curry was fortunate enough to be taken by a team with astute management and coaching that put together the right blend of players to help pioneer an era of position-less basketball. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be an outstanding pro,\u201d says Kruger, who has been a head coach at six Division I schools and also coached the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cYou never know exactly \u2026 no one expected him to explode on the college scene like he did. What he did had never been done before. \u201cA lot depends on the team that he goes to, and who\u2019s coaching him, and what freedom he\u2019s got there, too. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019ll become a really good pro sooner than people expect.\u201d Chris Dortch is the editor of the  Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Anything that had gone wrong in the past could be corrected tonight (or, tomorrow). There was another chance to remake, to get better, to build. And for those teams that make the playoffs and then lose, the slap is a double-whammy: the potential to win a championship is there, and then it is only not there, but the season ends, too \u2014 abruptly, finally. This past Elimination Week in the NBA playoffs proved particularly portent. Rarely have so many star players\u2019 futures been so uncertain. And as you must know by now if you\u2019ve followed the history of this league at all, star players drive everything. They are the show. And nothing happens until they decide what they are going to do, on and off the floor. And so the league will now have to wait for LeBron James, and Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George, to see what they will do. It starts with James, of course, but James is his own terraformer, shape-shifting entire franchises by a single phrase \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m in\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d The next Decision will have to wait at least another couple of weeks after James maxed out in a Game 7 first-round series win Sunday against the Indiana Pacers. Doing so sets up Cleveland for an Eastern Conference semifinals date with the top-seeded Toronto Raptors. But everyone will have to wait for James to decide\/announce his intentions before the free agent pile can move forward in July. Few organizations in sports have been as stable as the San Antonio Spurs have been over the last two decades. Win or lose, you always knew the Spurs would tinker along the margins, improve from within and be a contender the next season. With Leonard\u2019s quad injury and his distance \u2014 figurative and literal \u2014 from the team this season, there is no telling what the next version of the Spurs may be . \u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d Spurs guard Danny Green said in the quiet San Antonio locker room Tuesday, after they were eliminated by the Golden State Warriors. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think they (management) know. A lot of the league, I don\u2019t think, knows \u2014 there\u2019s so much changing up and down, with teams. It\u2019s the way the game\u2019s played \u2014 cap space, who\u2019s going where, who wants to play with who. You have to adapt and adjust.\u201d So even San Antonio has to enter the New NBA, where players have primacy in forming teams. They\u2019re pulling out all the usual stops there to keep Leonard in town , but the public nature of the disagreement between him and the team was so unprecedented for that franchise, it\u2019s hard to assess the impact. And yet, there has been regular communication between Leonard\u2019s representatives and the team, with two members of the Spurs\u2019 organization up in New York while Leonard has rehabbed his injury at the National Basketball Players Association\u2019s headquarters. But this has always felt like much, much more than a disagreement about a diagnosis of Leonard\u2019s quad. The Spurs have so many decisions to make, starting with their oldest veterans. Tony Parker will turn 36 before next season starts, and he has said his goal to finish his career is to play three more seasons in San Antonio to get to an even 20 years with the Spurs. But he\u2019ll be a free agent this summer with no guarantees he\u2019ll be asked back. Pau Gasol will be 38 on opening night next season, but he is under contract for next year at $16 million and was adamant after the season-ending loss to Golden State he plans to play next season , presumably for San Antonio \u2014 though he also made it clear he\u2019d like more playing time coming off of what he said was one of his most efficient seasons. And Manu Ginobili will be 41 when next season begins. He certainly looks like he can still contribute on the floor, based on some of his heroics this season, and he\u2019s only on the books for $2.5 million next year. He said he\u2019s likely to take a month or two as he usually does after the season to decide whether he, as he put it, can see himself \u201cas an ex-player.\u201d But Leonard will come first. There will be a meeting between him and the team\u2019s top brass, but no one seems to know when that will come to pass. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is still, obviously, grieving over the loss of his wife Erin, who died on April 18 . Everyone understands it will take him some time to feel that anything involving basketball is worth his time again. So everyone will wait. When and if that happens, the franchise and its star player have to decide if they can get on the same page again. The sense one gets is that Leonard isn\u2019t burning to leave town, but at 26, he realizes this is his best and last chance to look around, see what else is out there. And he sees other franchises that allow their superstar players a certain, shall we say, leeway in determining how they\u2019ll handle their business. They bring friends into the organization, both formally and informally, to guide them and give them familiar faces with which they\u2019re comfortable to travel with and hang out with at home. That is not the Spurs\u2019 Way. Don\u2019t get it wrong; family is a huge, central part of the Spurs\u2019 fabric. One can never forget the sight of Tim Duncan\u2019s kids with him on the floor at halftime of a Finals game a few years ago. One of the reasons the franchise was so devastated by Erin Popovich\u2019s death was the numerous and quiet kindnesses she performed for players and their wives and families over the years. But when it comes to the white lines, the Spurs are all business, taking their cue from Popovich and GM R.C. Buford. Why wouldn\u2019t they insist on things being done a certain way? They have five rings setting the standards, with the players willing and able to police themselves because there is no one else to whom to appeal. This isn\u2019t the same as being flexible in terms of strategy; no team has reinvented itself more than the Spurs have. This is about the way they do things, just as there\u2019s no getting past the definition of the Patriots Way as whatever their coach, Bill Belichick, says. Period. There is no similar problem at present in Oklahoma City, just an eerie uncertainty that one of those Acme anvils that always dropped on the Coyote\u2019s head just as he was about to throttle the Road Runner is about to drop on the Oklahoma City Thunder. Paul George has always said the right things about the Thunder since he got to Oklahoma City almost a year ago. And the franchise has done everything it could to make its best possible case for him to stay long term. But George has also been very consistent \u2014 he would be a fool to leave OKC if it made the conference finals or The Finals in his first season there. However, the Thunder will not make the conference finals or The Finals this year. And there are very few around the league who don\u2019t believe George won\u2019t now bolt \u2014 whether for Los Angeles and the Lakers or somewhere else. That would leave OKC with nothing to show for its trade of Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for George, with only Carmelo Anthony likely to return once he opts in for next year at almost $28 million. It\u2019s hard to see OKC being able to make a credible case now that it can provide what George says he wants \u2014 a chance to compete for championships. Whether he could do that in L.A. obviously depends on whether he can partner with another star player. There were times this season when George and Russell Westbrook looked great together. But after some stumbles out of the gate, the Thunder did away with Egalitarian Russ and put the ball back in his hands where he\u2019s at his best. And he\u2019s so good, that\u2019s often good enough for the Thunder. But you need more hands in the playoffs. And by the end of the first round, George was openly questioning his shot and gaacking a 2 of 16 finale in Salt Lake City , while Westbrook took 43 (!) shots in that Game 6 ouster. The Thunder had dreamed of a secure, post-Kevin Durant world with a Big Three that would divvy up the shots and wins like Halloween candy. Instead, the end of the season came hard and fast across OKC\u2019s cheek, like Loretta Castorini, leaving George free to go and the Thunder helpless to stop him. Where\u2019s an Acme anvil when you need one? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

His Pelicans were in the semifinals for the first time since they were the Hornets a decade ago. Back then, David West and Chris Paul \u2014 now twice removed from their New Orleans days \u2014 were the franchise\u2019s mainstays. And Davis was the key reason why, making an MVP push over the second half of the season since DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s season-ending Achilles\u2019 rupture in late January that was phenomenal in its scope. Davis scored at will, inhaled rebounds and opponent shots, and saved his best for last, averaging 33 points and 11.8 rebounds in New Orleans\u2019 sweep of Portland in the first round \u2014 a welcome salve for a city dealing with the death in March of Tom Benson. He owned both the Pelicans and the NFL\u2019s New Orleans Saints and was beloved through much of the Big Easy. The five-time All-Star Davis got a lot of help from Jrue Holiday, Rajon Rondo and newly acquired Nikola Mirotic, to be sure. But Davis is the swizzle stick that stirs the franchise\u2019s Sazerac . And as the Pels have gotten their swerve on, Davis might finally be able to relax for a while. There\u2019s a cottage industry of trade rumors for the supposedly unhappy Davis by assorted Celtics, Cavs and other fans who take it as inevitable that the poor misbegotten Pelicans will have to move their franchise player. Yet here\u2019s New Orleans, right where they are in the postseason, with \u201cThe Brow\u201d happy where he is, and ready to take them places they haven\u2019t been in a long time. Me: There\u2019s no way to prepare for the Warriors other than playing them, I know. But on the other hand, do you think they\u2019re prepared for the way you guys are playing now? Anthony Davis: No. We\u2019re a different team since, well, not the last time we played them. But overall, we\u2019re a different team. Playing fast, playing hard, playing for each other. We\u2019ve kicked it up a notch. We know that they did as well. It\u2019s going to be a fun series \u2014 competitive, physical. Me: What did you know about Niko before he came? AD: Nothing really. Shooter. That\u2019s all I saw, that he could shoot the ball. Any time we played him when he was in Chicago, the scout was, get into his air space, \u2018cause he can shoot the ball. But he can pass, defend \u2014 which surprised me. He\u2019s able to guard guards and even some bigs, and that surprised me. Rebound. Physicality. All of that surprised me about Niko, and he\u2019s been great for our team. Me: With him as a floor-spacer, what does that do for Jrue and the guards on offense? AD: It does a lot. Knowing that guys can\u2019t leave him. So Jrue, Rondo, E\u2019Twaun [Moore], Ian [Clark], all those guys, they can get in the paint. And they can\u2019t leave him. So layups, or lobs, and if they do leave him, we\u2019re kicking it out to him, and he\u2019s making shots. So he\u2019s playing real well. But his spacing gives myself the ability, and Jrue and all the guards, we\u2019re able to just play freely inside the paint. Me: Your team played so well against Portland. What was it like to be in a playoff series where you know, if we\u2019re not the better team, we\u2019re playing better than they are? AD: Our whole thing was just trying to take away their guards, knowing Dame and C.J. was the head of the snake. We take those two guys out, we knew it would probably be a little more difficult for those guys to play with us. Jrue, Rondo, E\u2019Twaun, Ian, they did a great job on those guys. Even when Niko and I switched on them, we were able to get some contests, make them shoot some tough shots. It was a great series for us to prepare for this. Of course the game plan is a lot different now. But I think that series prepared us to move on. That was a great team. But our whole mindset was we didn\u2019t want to go back to Portland. Every game was different. Guys were making shots. But we tried to take Dame or C.J. out of the game. We wanted both. But some games it was C.J. had 38 or something like that, but Dame only had 17. So we just wanted to make sure both of them didn\u2019t get going, and all four of our guards did a great job on them. Me: How much did beating the Warriors in Oakland at the end of the regular season help your team confidence going into the playoffs? AD: A lot. We needed to win four of our last five games to stamp that we were in the playoffs. And everybody was like, \u2019oh , (you might play) Golden State, we\u2019re not sure.\u2019 But we knew in the locker room, we go out and play the way we need to play, we\u2019ll be fine. We didn\u2019t turn the ball over that much. We defended. Of course we had to contend without Steph, but we wanted to make sure we came in to get this game. Guys was playing hard, playing for each other. We were making shots. Even when they made their runs, which they\u2019re going to make during the game, especially at home, we kind of came back with a run of our own. They make shots, the crowd goes crazy, get the ball out fast, score quick. That was our mindset. And we were able to do that and eventually win the game. Me: So what\u2019s the most important thing in a seven-game series with them? AD: Don\u2019t turn the ball over. Don\u2019t turn the ball over, and transition. That\u2019s what gets them going. We\u2019re a good defensive halfcourt team. We feel like we get in the halfcourt, we can stop anybody. But if we\u2019re turning the ball over, there\u2019s no defense for that. And they\u2019re getting out and they\u2019re not running for layups. All those guys are running for threes. So if we turn the ball over, taking bad shots and not getting back on defense, those guys are hitting threes. You do that three out of the next five, six possessions, that could be the difference in the game. So our thing is don\u2019t turn the ball over, and get back. Me: What has it been like in New Orleans these past few weeks? AD: Crazy. It\u2019s been crazy, it\u2019s been exciting. Our fans have been excited. Games have been packed. It\u2019s been loud. So it\u2019s been fun. They\u2019re excited for us, and we\u2019re excited to be doing this for the city. Especially with everything that happened with Mr. Benson. I think it kind of brought some life back to the city. Everybody\u2019s excited. Me: Did you know him well? AD: I did. It was a tough situation for me. I was in disbelief, honestly. But he did everything he could to make sure that we were as successful as possible. Whether it went to the new (practice) facility, the adjustments in the arena, giving our organization whatever they needed, he just wanted the guys to win. He\u2019d come in after games and say, if we lost, \u2018you guys didn\u2019t win tonight, but keep going.\u2019 Or if we did win, (he\u2019d say) \u2018great job tonight.\u2019 He always would say \u2018bring a championship.\u2019 That\u2019s all he said. So for us to go to the playoffs and then get out of the first round, and now we\u2019re in the second round, it kind of has given everybody in the city life, and confidence. It\u2019s been fun. Me: And Mrs. Benson came and talked to y\u2019all afterwards. AD: Sure. She did. Strong woman. Strong woman. She\u2019s supporting us the same way she did when Mr. Benson was here. She was in the role that\u2019s important, cheering us on. And she\u2019d come in the locker room and kind of give us that speech as well. So we\u2019re playing for him, we\u2019re playing for the city, we\u2019re playing for the organization. It\u2019s been a fun time for us. Me: How have you tried to keep Boogie in the loop while he\u2019s out? AD: He actually texted me today: \u2018be great.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I have to try to keep him in. He wants to be in the loop at all times. Of course he wants to be here and play, and it\u2019s tough on him, especially the way we\u2019re playing \u2014 \u2018man, I want to be a part of it,\u2019 and you\u2019re on the bench and we\u2019re playing so well. He wants to be a part of it and he can\u2019t. He tries to be part of the group as much as possible, whether it\u2019s just texting us, he came to the games in New Orleans. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s going to come out here, but he\u2019s there. \u2018AD, next game, maybe you can do this,\u2019 or \u2018AD, defensively, offensively, or whatever, tell the team this.\u2019 We have our own GroupChat with the players and he\u2019s constantly texting us in there. He\u2019s involved. And we can\u2019t ask more of him. Me: So, going forward, is there a way to incorporate what he does \u2014 because you were starting to play really well as a team when he got hurt \u2014 with the way you\u2019re playing now? AD: We\u2019d be a different team if he was playing. He brings so much to our team at both ends of the floor. Gives me a little break. But he\u2019s a big key to our team. When he went down, that\u2019s why we struggled the next five games. How do we run our offense now? A lot of stuff went through him at the top of the floor, because he was able to pass, able to dribble and facilitate. And so I had to kind of get back into, all right, \u2018AD without Boogie,\u2019 and got back into that and we were able to pick back up. If he was playing now, we\u2019d be a totally different team. We\u2019d probably be more inside-out. And then with the shooters that we have, adding Niko, our team would be totally different. And I think we\u2019d be even more dominant. Me: So, how gratified are you that this success you\u2019re having is finally starting to drown out all the talk of \u2018AD is going to leave New Orleans in a couple of years?\u2019 AD: It\u2019s still there. I still hear it. But I\u2019m just focused on now. Right now, we\u2019re playing well. I love these guys. I told them the other night at dinner, this is probably the best team I\u2019ve been on, from team chemistry to the way we play, to everything we do together. Guys are really locked in and want to win. And when you have a team like that, it\u2019s tough to think about anything else. And like I said, I\u2019m excited for the series, to see how we match up against these guys. They\u2019re the defending champs, four All-Stars on their team. And I think the guys are ready for it. It\u2019s going to be an exciting series. But I don\u2019t worry about anything else or what anyone else is saying about leaving or trades or whatever. I just worry about the guys in this locker room, and this team. Me: So, you played Rondo in Connect Four yet? AD: Nah, I haven\u2019t. But Rondo can\u2019t beat me, though. Me: What? AD: I love Connect Four. He can\u2019t beat me. Me: Dude, you\u2019re throwing it down against the all-time Connect Four guy. AD: We\u2019ll have to set it up. He can\u2019t beat me, though. Me: I want to televise it. AD: For sure. I won\u2019t allow him to beat me. But Rondo likes to cheat, though. He says if you\u2019re not cheating, you\u2019re not trying. Rondo likes to cheat. He looks a certain way, and I\u2019m like, \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 And we\u2019re both Pisces, so we kind of understand each other. We definitely should set it up. \u2014 Clippers forward Tobias Harris ( @Tobias31 ), Thursday, 10:13 p.m. David agrees wholeheartedly that speaking about oneself in the third person is incredibly obnoxious, and David wishes people would stop doing it. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve done in the past. I let my game speak for itself. I feel like, when I get a certain amount of minutes and when the coaches allow me to be me on the court, I\u2019m Rondo. There\u2019s no \u2018Playoff Rondo.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Rajon Rondo , to The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein , on why he hates what may be the greatest nickname in the game today. \u201cYou\u2019ll walk around at home in your drawers, that don\u2019t mean you\u2019ll go to your friends house and feel comfortable doing the same thing\u2026 I don\u2019t know where the hell that came from. I just thought it was a cool analogy.\u201d \u2014 DeMar DeRozan , to local reporters, on the comfort level players have playing at home as opposed to being on the road. \u201cIt was all mine. My staff, they don\u2019t really do anything. Every once in a while, I ask them to give me a coach or maybe a snack. But I make every decision.\u201d \u2014 Steve Kerr , batting aside the question of which assistant coach\/staffer came up with the idea of starting Nick Young, used sparingly in the first round against the Spurs, in Game 1 of the Warriors\u2019 Western Conference semifinal series with New Orleans. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Collin Iheanacho: My understanding is the Hawks want to bring in a young coach who can grow with the team, and can continue the development of their young guys like John Collins and Taurean Prince. They\u2019re not interested in squeaking out one or two more wins that they could probably get next season by hiring a retread. They\u2019re concentrating on a half-dozen candidates at present, including former Grizzlies coach Dave Fizdale, Portland assistant Nate Tibbets and Warriors assistant Jarron Collins. (Collins is rapidly rising in the coaching ranks; he\u2019s really sharp and has a really good rapport with players.) Ham\u2019s on that list, too, though my guess is he\u2019ll follow Budenholzer to his next gig; they\u2019re pretty close.  Ham and the other assistants remain under contract, though they\u2019ve been given permission by the Hawks to interview elsewhere if they choose; obviously, the new coach, whoever it is, will have the leeway to hire their own staff. There\u2019s no whole-scale housecleaning planned; the team\u2019s training staff, including the well-regarded Lyles, will remain in Atlanta. Ressler remains on board with the long-term plan of building through the Draft; there is constant contact between Ressler and Schlenk. The Hawks have five first-rounders the next two years (one is a protected first from Cleveland that could project to two seconds); it\u2019s on Schlenk and his staff to bat somewhere between .600 and .800 on those picks. They\u2019ve been playing with the Trade Machine since the sweep in the Rose City. From Monica Pascual Mate\u2019: From Lyle Ruthven:  If the Spurs do decide they have no choice but to trade Leonard, I don\u2019t think Portland would be where they turn. Nothing against C.J., who I love, or any of the other players that you two mentioned, but Leonard is an elite, top-10 talent. I just think San Antonio would have to ask for either an All-Star in return or a gaggle of young players and picks \u2014 the former if they think bringing in such a player can get them back to contender status next season, the latter if they think it\u2019s finally time to go earnest rebuild. Plus, I think they\u2019d be determined to get him out of the Western Conference. If I were the Spurs I\u2019d certainly seek out the Philadelphia 76ers, who have a trove of desirable assets. They\u2019ll either get a first-rounder from the Los Angeles Lakers (if the Lakers\u2019 pick is either first overall or anywhere from 6-30 in the first round of the Draft) or an unprotected first-rounder from the Sacramento Kings, which can be no worse than 10th overall, as well as a bunch of young players, none of whom are on prohibitive contracts. Let\u2019s posit that the Sixers get the Kings\u2019 pick. What if Philly, just for the sake of argument, offered San Antonio that Sacramento first, Robert Covington (whose extension, signed last year, goes down next season) and Markelle Fultz for Leonard? That would give the Spurs a young dynamo in Fultz who wouldn\u2019t have any of the pressure of being the number one pick in San Antonio \u2014 and would have the daily services of assistant coach Chip Engelland, who might be the best coach on earth to fix a broken shot. They\u2019d have a top 10 pick, which could net them any number of impact wings or guards . Covington isn\u2019t Leonard, but he\u2019s a damn good 3-and-D wing, one of the best in the league. The Spurs might ultimately say no, but they\u2019d damn sure have to think long and hard about it. And that potential would leave Philly with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, J.J. Redick and Dario Saric in its starting lineup. Which \u2026 my God. I know he\u2019s got an Oscar and all, now, but \u2026 man. From David Coleman: Well, who says Kobe is the premier NBA player? He\u2019s certainly in the top 10-15 all-time discussion, but Bill Russell has 11 rings, and Michael Jordan has six. If you mean among contemporary players, I\u2019d argue Tim Duncan gets a significant argument as just as good as Kobe was. As for LeBron vs. Kobe, it\u2019s a tough, tough call. Kobe has more rings, but LeBron\u2019s put up insane Finals numbers over the years. I\u2019d put Kobe ahead of LeBron at this point, but just barely; a fourth career title (in what would be an eighth straight Finals for his team) for James might turn the historical tide permanently.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (33.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 7.3 apg, .438 FG, .955 FT): Whether or not his mother is certified b y the NBPA , the point is, he doesn\u2019t really need an agent at this point of his career. 2) LeBron James (37 ppg, 8 rpg, 7.3 apg, .569 FG, .886 FT): Never seen LeBron so wiped out physically so early in the playoffs. 3) Anthony Davis (21 ppg, 10 rpg, .450 FG, .750 FT): Set another franchise record in the clincher over the Blazers last week, scoring a playoff record 47 points. That gives Davis that team record along with the others he already has: most points (9,607), rebounds (4,234), blocks (986), field goals (3,623), along with others. 4) Kevin Durant (25.5 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 3.5 apg, .450 FG, .917 FT): Well, if you like that sort of thing , I guess. 5) Russell Westbrook (38 ppg, 13 rpg, 5 apg, .420 FG, .783 FT): Season complete. We pause here to contemplate an NBA player taking more shots in one game (43) than he made in three games that week (42). 236 \u2014 U.S. college and international players who are early entry candidates for the 2018 Draft , making the April 22 deadline to put their names in. Players can withdraw up until June 11 \u2014 10 days before the June 21 Draft. 284 \u2014 Consecutive sellouts at Oracle Arena after Saturday\u2019s usual 19,596 attended the Warriors\u2019 Game 1 blowout of the Pelicans in the Western Conference semifinals. 17 \u2014 Years since the Bucks got out of the first round of the playoffs, after Milwaukee\u2019s Game 7 loss in Boston Saturday night. The Bucks have dropped eight straight first-round series since reaching the Eastern Conferene finals in 2001 behind the Ray Allen-Sam Cassell-Glenn Robinson trio that lost to Allen Iverson\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers. 1) The Rice Commission\u2019s report on the state of college basketball was pretty weak sauce when it came to some of the sport\u2019s biggest ills \u2014 namely, how to compensate players who generate billions of dollars for their respective universities yet who currently get next to nothing in return. But at least the Commission pointed out the fallacy of the efficacy of the current one and done rule. If the NBA and college basketball now both agree that the rule can and will be changed \u2014 two years is okay, three would be better \u2014 good. 2) Nothing against the Heat or Bucks, but \u201cSixers-Celtics\u201d in the playoffs has a special resonance for those who remember those franchise\u2019s postseason battles in the \u201860s and \u201880s. Happy to see that rivalry will be renewed this year. 3) My man Kickstradomis turned it up a notch with these Reggie Miller tribute kicks for the Pacers\u2019 Trevor Booker . 4) \u201cYes, officer, I have been drinking \u2026 but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I saw a large inflatable duck in the passing lane . What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do?? 1 ) Did John Wall continue to display an unfortunate habit of throwing his teammates under the bus  by saying the Wizards need to bring in some \u201cathletic bigs\u201d next season? Yup. Was he lying? Nope. Was he wrong? Nope. But, Wall also has to get better if Washington is going to go anywhere next season. He has to be in great shape from jump. He can\u2019t be lazy on defense and stick on every screen set on him. He sets the tone at both ends of the floor. When he\u2019s bouncy on D and using his length to contest shots and get deflections, the Wizards are at their best. When he\u2019s indifferent, so are they. The Wizards are almost exactly where Toronto was a year ago; they need a \u201creset\u201d just as the Raptors did, getting back to defense, adding more quality depth on the bench \u2014 and needing to learn to trust each other on the floor, no matter who\u2019s playing. 2) Thought Jay Triano did a pretty good job keeping the Suns from falling  completely off the rails this season after taking over early for Earl Watson. He\u2019ll be on someone\u2019s bench soon. 3) There is little joy in seeing Bill Cosby convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constant . There is less joy hearing and seeing his defenders on TV and in print invoking the lynching of Emmitt Till in comparison to what happened to him. No, no, a billion times, no. Emmitt Till was a child who murdered for no reason by a white mob that basically got away with it. Bill Cosby was a grown man who used his wealth, power and station to drug a woman and have sex with her against her will, was found guilty of it, and will go to prison because of it. Do not equate those two things, ever. Ever! 4) When I see evidence that those journalists who are expressing outrage at the jokes Michelle Wolf told at Saturday\u2019s White House Correspondents Dinner expressed the same outrage when, in 2004, the standing President of the United States \u201cjoked\u201d about not being able to find weapons of mass destruction \u2014 the predicate upon which our nation went to war with Iraq, costing thousands of American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars of our national treasure \u2014 then I will listen to what they have to say about Wolf. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

It is a rite of this season, in this age where everyone seems to be outraged all the time: if your team loses in the playoffs, it\u2019s because the refs either stink or are crooked. It is a position that gathers even more momentum after a year in which some run-ins between refs and players (and a few coaches) have gotten significant attention , feeding a narrative that the relationship between said people has never been worse . Yet, quietly, meetings behind the scenes during that same time have created some pressure releases, and fostered better understanding and empathy between some of the aggrieved.  The meetings have been part of the NBA\u2019s Officiating Advisory Council , one of more than a dozen initiatives created over the last year to try and strengthen the officiating program, from increased transparency in detailing officials\u2019 performance, to enhance \u201crespect for the game\u201d during meetings between officials and the 30 NBA teams in-season, to using new tools to improve their training and evaluation, to bringing in new staff at the league office level to oversee the multi-pronged programs. Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson was named Senior Vice President and Head of Referee Operations late last year. Former referee Monty McCutchen, generally considered the league\u2019s best official the last several years by players and staff \u2014 was pulled off the floor last December and named to the new position of Vice President of Referee Training and Development . They have pushed to implement the initiatives, which fall under the office of the NBA\u2019s President of League Operations, Byron Spruell. Since last year, three meetings have taken place that have included current and former NBA and WNBA players, coaches, referees, broadcasters and league office members. Two occurred last year; the third was last week in Chicago. The fourth will be held in Dallas in August. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great sessions, and a lot of issues were discussed,\u201d Spruell said Sunday by telephone. The three meetings have included a broad cross section of NBA constituencies. Among them are the standing members of the Advisory Council \u2014 former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Martin Dempsey; former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan; Hall of Famer Doug Collins; TNT studio analyst Kenny Smith, WNBA superstars and future Hall of Famers Tamika Catchings and Maya Moore and former NBA referee Steve Javie \u2014 with New Orleans Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger, Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon, Bulls associate head coach Jim Boylen, referees Marc Davis and Eric Lewis, Toronto Raptors All-Star guard Kyle Lowry, Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon, Brooklyn Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Grizzlies play-by-play man Pete Pranica and several league officials from different departments. The meetings and initiatives, Spruell said, all touched and touch on either the perception of the officials, or the performance of the officials. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to have people understand their expertise, and be able to relate it to the group in their own shoes,\u201d Spruell said. \u201cBut then be able to put yourself in the other people\u2019s shoes. And what I mean by that is focusing on the main three actors in the games \u2014 coaches, players and officials \u2014 and then certainly the influential aspect that broadcasters bring to bring the game to fans. \u201cThe magic that happened was, you had Kyle Lowry (in the meeting last fall), exceptional ballplayer, but very in tune with the game and the respect for the game. You had Monty McCutchen \u2014 the best in the game in the officiating, and at this time, Monty was not in his (current) role, but was getting ready for the season; Alvin Gentry and Becky Hammon \u2026 really opening up to understand another person\u2019s point of view \u2026 and from there we kept saying \u2018what else can we put on this group\u2019s agenda?\u2019 \u201d McCutchen said Sunday he has been encouraged by the continuing dialogue among the various constituencies. \u201c For me the most important thing I found is that people can come to these middle grounds with two perspectives: one being an authentic desire to contribute to a solution, but there\u2019s also the possibility of everyone coming to these situations trying to win, creating a debate-like atmosphere where you\u2019re trying to win a perspective and show how bright and smart you are and that you have \u201cthe\u201d answer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the thing that deeply impacted me was that all the constituents who came, came with the former process in mind: how can I contribute? How can I come looking inward for a solution rather than outward for a solution. And I have a role in this problem being solved, rather than \u2018it\u2019s your problem to solve.\u2019 I think Kyle had a great perspective that way.\u201d Lowry told the Toronto Star last December that the environment was \u201cnon-hostile\u201d and had a new appreciation for the job referees had to do, and the scrutiny that they are under by the league office, after speaking with McCutcheon. \u201cHe really did start to comment, internally, on a different perspective on refereeing,\u201d McCutcheon said Sunday. \u201cKyle\u2019s always been a really good man; that\u2019s not at stake here. But this year he clearly has shown a more measured approach to referees. He\u2019s still passionate. He still disagrees with some calls and at times, he may still occasionally get a technical foul. But when you\u2019ve been around Kyle for a decade, there\u2019s a marked and different approach to referees this year.\u201d In such ways \u2014 maybe gradually, maybe not all at once, and certainly, maybe, not in the heat of the playoffs \u2014 the relationship is going from DefCon 1 down to 2 or 3. The long view is where the potential payoff is. \u201cI think we did see less tension as the season went on,\u201d Spruell said. \u201cI think you see it ramping back up for the playoffs, which you would expect with the level of competition. But the direct relationship between players and officials, I think you have seen that tamp down a bit, based on some of the elements of the Officating Advisory Council and the Respect For the Game initiatives.\u201d Former player Shareef Abdur-Rahim , now the NBA\u2019s Vice President of Operations, participated in last week\u2019s meeting with Joerger, Boylen, Gordon, Hollis-Jefferson, Davis and Lewis.  \u201cYou get some of the stakeholders in what goes on with the game,\u201d Abdur-Rahim said Sunday. \u201cWe spent some time together the night before at dinner and followed it up with a working sessions about what was going on out on the floor. You hear other people\u2019s perspectives, other people\u2019s views on what\u2019s going on \u2014 how it\u2019s evolved, sharing perspective. But it also humanizes people and you share the experiences. It parallels a player\u2019s trajectory, a coaches\u2019 trajectory, officials trajectory. How each cares about the game, and studies, and works. From my time as a player on the court, I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Having that diversity of voices \u201csharing that, you come out of it with at least a little better appreciation of the other side of it and a fuller perspective of how we keep working to take care of the game,\u201d Abdur-Rahim said. \u201cUltimately, you get better relationships.\u201d Spruell said the NBA is making headway on many of the other initiatives. Those include improving referees schedules to reduce their overall travel and get them more time at home time, to increasing the number of officials (they have not reached the goal of upping the staff 10 percent by the end of this season, but they did hire four new referees last year and hope to add four to six more, perhaps looking at officials in the EuroLeague or FIBA to add to the existing pool). They also want to continue to explain the rules and officials\u2019 interpretations of same through mechanisms like the Last Two Minute Reports. (The NBA says its internal data indicates that while the L2M Reports have occasionally been criticized by some coaches and players as either too little too late or an incomplete snapshot of important calls, the transparency they\u2019ve created in whether refs got a call right or wrong down the stretch has improved the perception of officials among fans.) The league has also tried to improve its officials\u2019 public perception through all-access videos at the workplace and granting more access to officials to let them tell their individual stories, such as married NBA refs Lauren Holtkamp and Jonathan Sterling . And Spruell says the referees\u2019 accuracy measures have continued to improve \u2014 though that\u2019s only part of what he calls a \u201cholistic view\u201d to maximize officials\u2019 performance. Said McCutcheon: \u201cquite frankly, accuracy drives frustration, or lack thereof, in a game. One of the things that we\u2019ve been focusing on is that there\u2019s really two meaningful parts to being a complete official. There\u2019s that accuracy, and how hard you have to work to be accurate and good at your craft. And that\u2019s sort of action-to-whistle. But we\u2019re really starting to focus on another part of being an effective referee, which is whistle-to-the-next-set-of-action. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve done a great job in the past of educating and teaching our staff. We\u2019ve kind of left everyone to their own devices about how to learn how to handle whistle-to-the-next-set-of-action: \u2018oh, he has a way,\u2019 or \u201che or she doesn\u2019t have a way, or she does have a way.\u2019 \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to have broader contextual conversations on what it means to be a referee. If you\u2019re going around blowing calls left and right, you can\u2019t do this job. There\u2019s a threshold of excellence we have to live at. But we\u2019re really at a high threshold there already \u2026 the big steps we can take are how do we start to find the balance between strength without arrogance, and humility without weakness? How do we find this effective way of running a game without being condescending or arrogant or overly authoritative? But the opposite is just as bad. If you have people who have an interest in the win running the game, you have trouble. Because integrity is at stake. So referees do have a role of strength in our game \u2026 our league is about strength if nothing else \u2014 strength of character, strength of will, strength of actual physicality. But you have to be a strong person to be successful.\u201d The upcoming August meeting, Spruell said, will be the most ambitious yet \u2014 10 to 12 players, 10 to 12 coaches and 10 to 12 officials. There may be other forums such as golf outings and other team-building exercises between players, coaches and referees as well off the court and continue. And in addition, he said, the league is kicking around the idea of inviting some fans of various teams in to the August meeting to try and demystify the process and allow them to provide their perspective \u2014 as the only constituency that has to pay to get into the event, after all, they may see things a little differently than everyone else \u2014 again, especially at this time of year. \u201cWe want to bring those people into the tent as well,\u201d Spruell said. \u201cMaybe not the ones who are so corrosive and will never change their minds (about officials) \u2026 but the folks that bring a different point of view, we absolutely want to bring them in the tent and deal with that sort of perspective, to see what movement we can make with those type of core fans who are so bought into kind of being a homer, or etcetra., who are so hard pressed to be homers. I have no problem to bring some folks like that into the tent for some part of the Council \u2026 to be able to dispel the myths and conspiracy theories that are out there with some fans, and fold them into the Council in some form or fashion. I\u2019m absolutely open to that, because I think it can help us with additional perspective.\u201d McCutcheon said the league, players and coaches have good templates of how the games themselves should look, even as competition and the desire to win may color everyone\u2019s perspectives at crucial moments. The sweet spot is finding common ground when there is disagreement \u2014 not muting passion or wanting to win, but also not putting officials in a position \u201cwhere they stand on high and they are unassailable in their perfection,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cWe all know that\u2019s not true. We know we make mistakes.\u201d But there is still a \u201cvacuum of knowledge about our profession,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re open to sharing the upright and the upstanding and integrity-based work that we do, out of a natural extension of that, people who are filling in those brackets with their ideas will come to a different understanding of the outcome,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThe issue for me isn\u2019t the outcome. The real issue for me is that our group should be doing good work, and we should be educating people on the good work that our staff does. If we do good work, the outcome will take care of itself, except than the most extreme cases of people who hold those (conspiratorial) opinions. If you\u2019re a hammer, everything looks like a nail to you. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case with most people\u2026education on our end can take that low-hanging fruit and turn it on its head and say \u2018no, here\u2019s what we\u2019re about, here\u2019s how we can discuss it as authentic people, and then you can make good, informed decisions.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Brown\u2019s size and length makes him one of the few guards that could really make Ben Simmons work to get his shots off. 7) Utah Jazz (2-2) [6]: See Boston above if Ricky Rubio\u2019s hamstring does the same to his chances of playing against Houston. 8) New Orleans Pelicans (0-1) [7]: It\u2019s not gonna be the North Texas Smoothie King Center now , is it? 9) Indiana Pacers (1-2) [12]: Season complete. What a turnaround season for the Pacers, whose future is extremely bright. 10) Oklahoma City Thunder (1-2) [10]: Season complete. I would not write off a Carmelo opt-in followed in near-record time by a Carmelo trade somewhere. Yes, he\u2019ll be 34 on opening night. Yes, he\u2019s not good at all defensively. But in a league where scoring averages show no signs of slowing down, you still need guys who can get buckets. \u2018Melo can still do that with regular minutes. Someone could use that, on what you shouldn\u2019t forget will be a one-year commitment only. 11) San Antonio Spurs (0-1) [9]: Season complete. It will not shock, if Mike Budenholzer doesn\u2019t get the head coaching job he seeks \u2014 or, if Ettore Messina does get a head gig in the NBA \u2014 to see Bud back on the Spurs\u2019 bench next season. He should be in no hurry to take a bad job with his last two years\u2019 worth of checks from Atlanta accruing interest nicely. 12) Miami Heat (0-1) [13]: Season complete. Can the Heat find a taker for Hassan Whiteside? 13) Milwaukee Bucks (1-2) [14]: Season complete. Now comes one of the biggest questions in the recent history of the franchise: who will coach Giannis Antetokounmpo going forward, if interim Joe Prunty doesn\u2019t keep the gig? Because of the Greek Freak, it\u2019s the most coveted job among the currently unemployed in the coaching ranks. 14) Minnesota Timbewolves (0-2) [15]: Season complete. Making the playoffs after 12 seasons outside the dance was a worthwhile and reasonable goal this season. But the Wolves have to aim much higher next year. 15) Portland Trail Blazers [11]: Season complete. Wouldn\u2019t expect a breakup of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The Pacers snagged the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference and immediately were eyeball-to-eyeball with LeBron James and his defending champion Cavaliers. Now it\u2019s Toronto\u2019s turn to face \u2014 one round earlier than they might have hoped or expected \u2014 Cleveland in the conference semifinals. It\u2019s a matchup the Raptors would have preferred to delay or duck entirely. But in truth, it\u2019s one they ought to embrace, not just for some advantages they hold over the Cavs but as an opportunity to be pro-active rather than reactive in their burgeoning growth as a legit title contender. Toronto spent last summer and this season becoming less reliant on its All-Star guards, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, and the results have been impressive all around. Offensively, defensively, statistically and stylistically, the Raptors were better than their 2016-17 selves and, aside from a late 3-5 swoon, the class of the East. Cleveland, by contrast, leans more on James than it has at any point since the 2015 postseason. Judged by their point differential, the Cavs at 50-32 probably won half a dozen games more than they \u201cshould\u201d have. The roster makeover at the trade deadline has been a mixed bag, delivering younger players who presumably fit better. But the learning curve has been bumpy for the new guys and the holdovers alike. Cleveland ousted Toronto in each of the past two postseasons. It has won six consecutive playoff games against the Raptors in doing so, and any team with James is a threat to snatch the home-court edge the instant the series begins. Yet there are big difference between this year\u2019s showdown and those that came before. Previously, the Cavs came in rested and ready. This time, however, they had to battle through seven games against the Indiana Pacers . This time, Toronto was the team with a little time off, courtesy of its six-game triumph over the Washington Wizards . The Raptors are a better team than Indiana but they\u2019ll have to show it on the court, with James double-dog-daring them, hoping he can stay in DeRozan and Lowry\u2019s heads a bit longer. 1. Who guards LeBron? This should be the first question of every preview of every playoff series of every season of James\u2019 career since he first started qualifying in 2006. Toronto\u2019s past two defensive-minded wings \u2013 DeMarre Carroll and P.J. Tucker \u2013 didn\u2019t get the job done. Now the Raptors will be leaning on rookie OG Anunoby, who gives up precious bulk. James helped Cleveland to its 2-1 record in the regular season showdowns, scoring more (29.3 ppg) and shooting better (57 percent overall, 40 percent from the arc and 80 percent from the line) than he did against the rest of the league. 2. Who are the X factors for each team? The Raptors\u2019 Fred Van Vleet is first among backup equals on Toronto\u2019s bench, the league\u2019s best. Twenty-three of his 35 games scoring in double figures came in the second half. Cleveland has no one like that off its bench, going more with traditional second-unit players rather than reliable instant offense. For the Cavaliers, then, it\u2019s a starter, Kevin Love, who could make or break his team\u2019s trek to a fourth consecutive Finals. Love found his errant 3-point shot in the finale against Indiana, but there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t drift on him again. He hasn\u2019t played up to his paper status as Cleveland\u2019s second-best player after You Know Who, but Love did thrive in the season series against the Raptors (17 ppg, 12 rpg, 8-13 from the arc). 3. Which team wins from long distance? In league rankings, the Cavaliers and the Raptors were pretty close in 3-point attempts (fifth and third, respectively) and makes (third and fourth). But in the three games they played against each other, Toronto launched 10 more per game (36.7 to 26.7) and outscored the Cavs by 8.4 points. Cleveland is at its best when shooters such as Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith and Love are spaced out and hitting from distance. That\u2019s why Indiana tempered its double-teaming of James, lest he find one of those guys open. Chasing the Cavs when they\u2019re scoring by 2s is hard enough; they prefer to have you chasing their 3s. Lowry and Van Vleet are the Raptors\u2019 biggest threats from the arc, with DeRozan more than doubling his attempts and makes from last season. 26 percent \u2014 In their series against the Raptors, the Washington Wizards took just 26 percent of their shots from 3-point range, the lowest rate in the first round and down from 31 percent in the regular season . The best way to defend opponent 3-point shooting is to prevent 3-point shots, and the Raptors were the most improved team in that regard this season. They allowed their opponents to take just 29 percent of their shots from beyond the arc in the regular season, the second lowest rate in the league and down from 33 percent (the eighth highest rate) last season. In their sweep of the Raptors in last year\u2019s conference semifinals, the Cavs outscored Toronto by 25.5 points per game from on 3-point shots, taking 41 percent of their shots and shooting 47 percent from beyond the arc. The Raptors are taking more 3-pointers themselves this season, but more important (especially against this opponent) is that they\u2019re preventing them on the other end of the floor. \u2014 John Schuhmann Indiana was successful in keeping its series against Cleveland all about basketball, even in defeat. Toronto, in being ousted by the Cavs in 2016 and 2017, has endured more of a psychological test. Specifically, DeRozan and Lowry seemed to have let James get into their heads. That\u2019s the reason James was beating his chest, hollering \u201cI\u2019m still a problem!\u201d late in an early April smackdown. But this is a deeper, more versatile and multi-faceted Toronto team, and Cleveland has taken a step back. Plus DeRozan, Lowry and the rest of them have just seen the Pacers push James and his crew to the brink. This time, stepping up in class in facing the Raptors and dealing with the cumulative grind of two long series means trouble for Cleveland.

The person, who asked to remain anonymous because the search is ongoing, said the Suns are in the midst of second interviews \u201cwith a handful of candidates still in the mix.\u201d Triano served as interim coach for all but the first three games of last season after Earl Watson was abruptly fired. Triano guided an exceedingly young and injury-plagued team to a 21-61 record, worst in the NBA and second-worst in franchise history. Phoenix has the most ping pong balls and therefore the best chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in next months\u2019 draft lottery. The Suns conducted initial interviews with a wide range of candidates, including Triano. Among those publicly linked to the job are former Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale, ex-Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford, former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt and ex-Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets coach Jason Kidd. Former Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer removed his name from consideration. Azcentral (The Arizona Republic) reported that Clifford and San Antonio Spurs assistant coach James Borrego were in Phoenix for interviews last week and that team officials also spoke with Toronto Raptors assistant coach Nick Nurse and New Orleans Pelicans assistant head coach Chris Finch. General manager Ryan McDonough has said the team is prepared to make a strong move to improve the level of talent, particularly experienced talent, to build around the young talented trio of Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren. Phoenix, once one of the league\u2019s most vibrant franchises, has not made the playoffs in eight seasons. Triano took over and kept the team\u2019s effort high despite the lack of victories, working to improve the youngsters, a project that was most evident in the development of the rookie Jackson. Born in Canada, Triano became an assistant coach with the Raptors in 2002 and was named Toronto\u2019s interim coach after Sam Williams was fired in 2008 and eventually signed a three-year deal as coach there. He went 87-142 with the Raptors. Triano was assistant coach of the Portland Trail Blazers from 2012 to 2016 before joining Watson in Phoenix.

Given the stakes, and how essential he\u2019d been to the Cavaliers\u2019 performances through the first six games of the Eastern Conference first-round series against Indiana \u2013 logging 245 of a possible 288 minutes \u2013 it almost felt inevitable. Besides, his team\u2019s theme for this postseason is \u201cWhatever It Takes,\u201d so y\u2019know, truth in advertising and all that. Then, in the game\u2019s 36th minute, that whole narrative changed. Before long, the most watchable player in the league for his astounding, explosive and varied exploits on the court had people fixating on and monitoring his minutes while he sat. Boy, did James sit too. After heading to the locker room at the start of his unexpected breather, he planted himself in a chair on the Cavaliers bench and didn\u2019t budge. Not for timeouts, when players who aren\u2019t in the game traditionally stand at the back of the huddle. Not for the mini celebrations, either, when a teammate would drain a 3-pointer and other Cavs would rise from the bench, arms jubilantly held high. James sat. Sat with his towel and his orange slices for 4 minutes 35 seconds in all, from late in the third to the 8:25 mark of the fourth. With the time between the quarters as bonus sitting. What made it possible was the help James got in those pivotal minutes from the unlikeliest of sources. Which is to say, anyone other than himself. James had been, by necessity, a one-man gang in the series before Sunday. He had averaged 40.7 points in Cleveland\u2019s three victories \u2013 46, 32 and 44 \u2013 and by series end still hadn\u2019t gotten a single 20-point performance by any other Cavs player. People had begun likening this crew to the 2007 Cleveland team that, despite limited talent and modest contributions, somehow made it to The Finals on James\u2019 broad back. Then came this comparative revelation in Game 7. When James finally sat down, Cleveland led 75-74, its 14-point edge in the second quarter a faded memory. When he returned? The Cavs were up 86-79. A lineup of George Hill, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Kyle Korver and Jeff Green not only had avoided disaster, it had extended the lead. The Pacers and their coach, Nate McMillan, knew something precious had slipped through their fingers. \u201cYou have an opportunity to make a run. He\u2019s resting. And we didn\u2019t capitalize off of that,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThe start of that quarter, we had four or five possessions we didn\u2019t score. We switched our lineups quickly, but by that time \u2026 they built on that lead. And LeBron came into the game.\u201d With some rest better than no rest, James returned to do what he does. He scored seven more points, including a backdoor layup with 30 seconds left that all but clinched it. His stats line when it was over was more individual magnificence: 45 points on 16-of-25 field-goal shooting and 11-of-15 from the foul line, with nine rebounds, seven assists and four steals. But for all his trouble, in his 43:25 on the court, James was minus-2. While he sat, the other Cavs were plus-6. It was the first time all series that their leader ran a deficit and the Cavaliers won. Cleveland had gotten a glimpse of what was to come soon after tipoff. James got the Cavs\u2019 first four points but teammates scored the next 15. The most surprising contribution came from Tristan Thompson, the big man nearly forgotten in the series besides 14 minutes in Game 6 garbage time. He\u2019d been relegated to the early 5-on-5 scrimmages for deep reserves like Cedi Osman, Ante Zizic and Kendrick Perkins who otherwise were riding pine. \u201cJust staying in rhythm, because you never know,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long playoff journey. I remember our first year together [in 2015, Kevin] Love goes down against Boston. I get thrown into the starting lineup against Chicago. \u2026 If I\u2019m not on the court, I\u2019ve got to be able to cheer my teammates on from the sideline, be there mentally and keep guys locked in and focused.\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue not only played Thompson in Game 7, he started the 6-foot-10 Canadian and played him his longest minutes (34:54) all season. The 27-year-old chipped in six points and seven rebounds before the game was 10 minutes old, Cleveland leading 26-16 by that point. He finished with 15 and 10, and one ferocious block of Darren Collison\u2019s layup attempt that Thompson swatted into the stands. James had other helpers in pushing his personal mark to 13-0 in first-round series and five consecutive victories in Game 7s (5-2 overall). Point guard George Hill had missed the three previous games with back pain but checked in with 7:12 left in the third and stayed on the floor the rest of the way. Hill scored 11 points, hit nine of his 11 free throws and gave Cleveland another ball handler and perimeter defender. That helped counter the 53 points scored by Indiana\u2019s starting backcourt, including 30 by Victor Oladipo (25 after halftime). Love had struggled so much offensively, he was bound face serious blame if Cleveland had been ousted. Instead, Love sank four of his seven 3-point attempts and finished with 15 points. J.R. Smith had 11 points and pestered Oladipo defensively. The Pacers admitted they were caught off-guard by Thompson\u2019s appearance and impact. Already spread thin fending off James and accounting for his 3-point shooters, dealing defensively with Thompson that led to another of Indiana\u2019s poor starts, from which they eventually dug out in the third quarter. But outscoring Cleveland by 41 points overall in the seven games, 704-663, offered no more solace to the Pacers than the winning the popular vote did to Democrats in November 2016. They were interested neither in stats technicalities nor pats on the head. They got an unfortunate draw as a No. 5 seed having to face James and the East\u2019s three-time defending champs. They nearly did what no conference team has done to James \u2013 blocking his path to the Finals \u2013 since Boston in 2010. They aren\u2019t done, either. \u201cIf y\u2019all don\u2019t respect the Indiana Pacers now, I have no respect for you,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cNo one thought we were going to be here. No one. Not one person. But us in the locker room. I feel like we\u2019ve earned our respect from everyone.\u201d Meanwhile, at the crossroads of win or go home, the Cavs\u2019 \u201cother guys\u201d stepped up. Sooner or later, you\u2019d think an unreliable supporting cast would start to feel a little self-conscious, with James lugging them wherever they manage to go. Sooner or later, you\u2019d expect them almost to be guilted into contributing. \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve got the best player in the world on your team,\u201d Thompson said, \u201cgiving it everything he\u2019s got \u2026 for me and the younger guys, we\u2019ve got to pick it up. He\u2019s giving 100 percent, we\u2019ve got to give 120. He\u2019s going to war for us every night. We\u2019ve got to do the same thing.\u201d The next battle comes Tuesday, when Cleveland faces No. 1 seed Toronto in the conference semifinals without home-court advantage. The level of help the Cavs\u2019 role players provide from one game to the next is an unknown, same as how the team copes plunging immediately into the next round. The past three years, going 12-0 in the first round and 36-5 in the East bracket, there always was some rest-and-recovery time between series. Not now. \u201cI\u2019m burned right now,\u201d James said when asked for a look ahead. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about Toronto right now, until tomorrow. I\u2019m ready to go home. I\u2019m tired, I want to go home.\u201d He looked and sounded tired, too. Despite (cough) all the unexpected rest. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The sweet-shooting team that rolled through the NBA regular season to the tune of a franchise-best 65 wins, finally showed up \u2026 for a half, at least. The lock-down defense on the perimeter and in the paint \u2026 the showtime gamesmanship of both James Harden and Chris Paul \u2014 it was all there from the start. Now if coach Mike D\u2019Antoni could just get his crew to keep it up for four straight quarters (instead of a half or the three quarters in five games of the Rockets\u2019 first-round series win), he\u2019d be a lot happier. Because when it\u2019s all clicking the way it did early in the Rockets\u2019 110-96 Game 1 lip-busting of the Utah Jazz here Sunday at Toyota Center, there is no confusion as to who and what these Rockets believe themselves to be. \u201cScary,\u201d is the way Harden described it afterwards. Yes, things got sort of interesting late, after the Jazz woke up and started chewing into the Rockets\u2019 27-point cushion. D\u2019Antoni said he started sweating when the lead dwindled to 11 in the fourth quarter. He said he was sweating with every dazzling move Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell made to get himself or a teammate a shot. That caused D\u2019Antoni to send Harden back into the game three minutes earlier than usual. \u201cIt was a total game until halftime,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cObviously we came out ready to roll from the get-go. Halftime happened, and we didn\u2019t have a lot of the juice we should have had. Obviously, we were ready to roll from the get go. They came off a tough series and we had to take advantage of it. They had some dead legs and we came out and did what we were supposed to do. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much emotion and you get in the game and we \u2019 re up 27 or up 24 and you kind of let down and it\u2019s hard to get it back. Give them credit, they kept fighting. We did what we were supposed to do and obviously we\u2019re happy \u2026 but we can do better.\u201d Better than having Harden or Paul on hand to answer every one of the Jazz\u2019s potentially momentum-shifting play with one of their own? Sure. How much better? That\u2019s the real question. What\u2019s the ceiling for a team that has used this formula the Rockets have used all season? \u201cOnce again, I think this team offensively, us, we\u2019re just different,\u201d Harden said in trying to describe how the Rockets can perk up so quickly offensively against one of the league\u2019s elite defenses. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many different defenses throughout the year that it prepared us for this moment, whether it\u2019s [Rudy] Gobert back at the rim or team\u2019s switching. We\u2019ve seen it all, pretty much all year, so we watch film and we figure out how we can create three [point shots] and create opportunities for each other and we just go out there and play our butt off.\u201d Yes, things looked a little choppy at times the past few weeks for Houston. But that\u2019s to be expected when you\u2019ve been as good as the Rockets have been during parts of the 2017-18 season. Trying to find that groove again has proved to be tougher than imagined. D\u2019Antoni is doing his best to ring the alarm for his team since March, running them through all of the fire drills, without altering the threat level prematurely. \u201cMy job is to nit-pick and try to get better when we\u2019re not good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only scored 46 points in the second half, so that\u2019s not good. Pace wasn\u2019t where it should be. Defensively, we had some breakdowns. We had 15 turnovers that gave them 22 points and at halftime there were like five turnovers. We got careless and all that came from the sloppiness in general. Those are the things that we can control. That\u2019s what makes them good, is that we can play a lot better than this.\u201d Still, D\u2019Antoni could use some outside help making his points. The Jazz stole D\u2019Antoni\u2019s shot at injecting some emotion and urgency into his team by upsetting the Oklahoma City Thunder (and their trio of superstars) in the first round . Harden (this season\u2019s Kia MVP favorite) going up against his former teammate Russell Westbrook (and the reigning Kia MVP) would have provided on-court fireworks from two of the league\u2019s most dynamic players. They\u2019ll have to settle instead for whatever fire Mitchell and the Jazz can generate without their starting point guard available for the foreseeable future. Ricky Rubio left Game 6 of Utah\u2019s series-clinching win vs. OKC with a hamstring injury and isn\u2019t expected back before Game 5 of the West semis (provided this series lasts that long). And truth be told, the Game 1 script was already written before Sunday\u2019s opening tip. The Jazz showed up here spent, physically and emotionally, some 36 hours after that roller coaster series-clinching win over the Thunder Friday night. The fact that they couldn\u2019t seem to match the Rockets\u2019 energy and precision in the first half was no surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick turnaround, obviously there is some fatigue but that wasn\u2019t the reason for the performance tonight,\u201d Mitchell said, pushing back on the narrative that his team didn\u2019t show up here with the requisite energy and effort needed to win. \u201cWe landed at 5 a.m. in San Antonio and played the same day and won. We\u2019ve been through tough times as a teamed we\u2019ve gone through it. We really didn\u2019t know what to expect, we really didn\u2019t know game plan wise and we figured it out in the second half. I don\u2019t think it was so much of a fatigue factor.\u201d What couldn\u2019t be debated was the fact that one of the best defensive teams in the league could be so easily manipulated. Jazz center Rudy Gobert is the likely frontrunner for the Kia Defensive Player of the Year award that will be handed out in late June . But he was missing in action as the Rockets built that early lead before halftime. Harden and Paul took turns exploiting their mismatches on offense, finding opens shots for themselves and their teammates at will. They got whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it. They forced the Jazz to pick which poison to digest against the league\u2019s most diabolical and devastating point guard duo. And yet it still feels like we haven\u2019t seen these Rockets pushed to the limit in this postseason. They were routed in their Game 3 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round , thus keeping them from a playoff, crunch-time situation. So far, no Western Conference foe has been capable of consistently countering Houston\u2019s attack and drive it out of its comfort zone. Jazz coach Quin Snyder and his staff have just two practice days to come up with wrinkles they can add to the mix, particularly for Harden, before Wednesday\u2019s Game 2. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d Snyder said of Harden. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to give credit to all the things he does. He just impacts the game in so many ways. You have to just have to make it harder for him in so many facets. And it requires your whole team to guard him because he\u2019s capable of finding any weakness in any given situation. \u201cA good player can see their man and the help; a better player can see three [things] and he sees everything. That\u2019s what makes him so unique, is that he has the ability to complete all of those plays. And we still have to go out and compete and make it hard on him. But I don\u2019t think there is any mystery to what a good player he is, and you can see it night after night.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

It doesn\u2019t sound like he wants Parker to leave as a restricted free agent. \u201dJabari ain\u2019t going nowhere,\u201d Antetokounmpo said with a smile. \u201dHe\u2019s going to be here and he\u2019s going to be ready for the next season.\u201d It\u2019s just one of two big decisions facing the Bucks this offseason. They might be hiring a new coach, too. The organization has arrived at a crossroads. A new arena is opening in the fall, while Antetokounmpo is a budding NBA superstar because of the athleticism that earned him his \u201dGreek Freak\u201d nickname. However they proceed, the Bucks have grown beyond being a feel-good story. They\u2019ve established a baseline of success with the Antetokounmpo-led group, having gone to the playoffs three times in the last four years. The next step is to get beyond the first round for the first time since going to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001. The best way to do that is to play more consistently in the regular season in order to secure a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round. The Bucks were eliminated on Saturday night by the Boston Celtics in seven games, with all four losses coming on the road. \u201dClinching the playoffs, going to Game 7, somewhat of an accomplishment. Not really what we set out to do,\u201d guard Malcolm Brogdon said Sunday as players had exit interviews with coach Joe Prunty at the team\u2019s downtown training facility and packed up for the offseason. Whether Prunty is back when the Bucks reconvene for training camp remains in question. The veteran assistant was promoted to replace the fired Jason Kidd in late January. General manager Jon Horst said at the time that the team would conduct a search after the season and that Prunty would be a candidate. That\u2019s still the case, Prunty said, although the team has not detailed when it will conduct interviews. \u201dTo be honest with you, I think at this stage we all thought we would still be playing and were hoping that we would be playing,\u201d Prunty said. Milwaukee was 21-16 under Prunty in the regular season after starting 23-22 with Kidd. Getting to Game 7 in the first round was a small measure of progress after Milwaukee was eliminated in six games the previous season by Toronto. But issues that plagued the Bucks during the regular season contributed to their demise against the Celtics. Milwaukee finished last in the NBA in rebounding (39.8 per game) and 25th in opponent 3-point shooting (37 percent). The Bucks excelled on the break and were sixth in the league in 2-point shooting (53 percent) but 22nd from 3-point range (35 percent). A full year with Parker might help. He averaged 12.6 points in 31 games after returning in February from the second left knee injury of his four-year career. Antetokounmpo thinks his teammate\u2019s return is a done deal. \u201dAnd we are going to be all excited, playing in a new arena and everyone is going to be having fun,\u201d he said. Other notes and highlights as the offseason begins: COOL KHRIS Khris Middleton can get overshadowed sometimes by the high-flying Antetokounmpo. But the sixth-year forward is making a name for himself with his all-around game. After scoring a career-high 20.1 points per game in the regular season, Middleton averaged 24.7 in the playoffs. He\u2019s also capable of guarding every position but center. THUMBS UP? Eric Bledsoe played the last three games of the series with a wrap protecting his left thumb. The right-handed Bledsoe said Sunday that he hoped to avoid surgery, but that he might have to wear a brace for a couple months. JET PACKED Veteran guard Jason Terry wants to return to Milwaukee for his 20th NBA season. The NBA\u2019s active career leader in 3-point field goals will be 41 when the next season tips off in October. Averaging 16 minutes a game, Terry\u2019s most important role was to bring energy off the bench. He\u2019s also a respected voice in the locker room. \u201dObviously I know my impact. I\u2019ve been here two years now. I want to see the process, the finished product, because I know the potential,\u201d Terry said."},{"id":40707,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-boston-celtics-vs-philadelphia-76ers","date":"2018-04-29","title":"Numbers preview: Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers","content":" This will be the 20th time that the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are meeting in the postseason.

John Wall missed a chunk of the season and strangely enough, Washington played reasonably well without him. And then in the first round, Washington forced the top-seeded Raptors to six games before bowing out . Back and forth, up and down. The Wizards never developed a firm identity or cohesion. And that\u2019s why Wall believes the team needs to undergo some changes, maybe even major changes, before the next season. Can Wall coexist with Bradley Beal? That All-Star backcourt still hasn\u2019t produced big returns, although not necessarily to their own fault, but if the right deal comes along, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Washington did something bold.

But enough about Steph Curry\u2019s closely-inspected pre-game warmup drills. The second-round playoff opener against the Pelicans held everyone\u2019s attention for roughly the same length of time. The once-bored Warriors, who are woke now, ran Anthony Davis and friends off the floor comfortably before halftime. As they await the return of Curry, and Tuesday for Game 2 looks likely for that , the Warriors straight-up clowned New Orleans almost from the start, dropping threes, making stops, zipping downcourt on fast breaks and essentially throwing themselves an Oaktown version of Mardi Gras. In a late second-quarter frolic that especially caused the sellout crowd to sway, Draymond Green tossed a lob to Kevin Durant for a dunk and Klay Thompson drilled a three-point bomb from the corner, where he was immediately groped by the frolicking Warriors\u2019 bench. The Warriors broke for 41 points in that quarter; in the second and third quarters combined, New Orleans scored just 40. Party on. \u201cIt was probably the loudest I\u2019ve heard Oracle all year,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cIt was kind of a weird regular season but the playoffs are here and our guys feel that, our fans feel that and the second quarter reflected what\u2019s at stake and what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d It was Warriors 123, shell-shocked Pelicans 101, and yes, there\u2019s no guarantee the rest of the series will be a Big Easy for the defending champions. This is the playoffs; stuff happens, scripts flip. That said, they will get a two-time MVP, and a restless one at that, back in the lineup sooner rather than later. So this is looking rather promising for the Warriors and gloomy for the Pelicans, much less the rest of the remaining NBA playoff field. Even before Curry went through his customary dribble and shoot routine, where he looked sharp, Kerr had already decided to keep the point guard on ice for at least another 72 hours. Kerr explained that Curry has had limited scrimmaging time since healing from an MCL knee sprain on March 23, and wanted to play it safe. In Kerr\u2019s words, the coach was \u201cprotecting Steph from himself.\u201d Kerr said Curry didn\u2019t take the news well, but this was no negotiation. \u201cWhen you have been out five weeks and you want to play in the playoffs, I don\u2019t think one scrimmage is enough, even though he wanted to play and pleaded his case,\u201d Kerr explained. \u201cI just think going through the next few days and making sure he is feeling good and holding up well is the right approach.\u201d The stakes, obviously, are steep, too much to roll the dice in the second round, no disrespect to the Pelicans. Curry\u2019s body has proven fragile this season, with ankle and knee injuries over the last four months sending a jolt through the organization. None of his ailments were serious or needed surgery; still, the Warriors rightly were leaving nothing to chance, especially since nothing major was at stake. That changes now. Davis and the Pelicans, having swept through the first round, have Golden State\u2019s attention. Also, assuming a Rockets-Warriors conference final in a few weeks, Curry will need to shake the rust for what would be an epic series on paper. \u201cHe looks great in practice, looks great in workouts,\u201d said Durant. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for him to get back in a place he enjoys the most, which is playing ball. He loves the game just as much as anybody I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d What\u2019s most important, and impressive, is how the Warriors decided to ramp it up before Curry\u2019s return. The energy, intensity and sense of urgency was evident against the Pelicans and it turned Game 1 into a rout, and that combination wasn\u2019t always evident in a season where the Warriors pressed the snooze button following the All-Star break. Their defense against the Pelicans was worry-free from the second quarter onward. Green held Davis to just two points in the second quarter when the game changed; Green finished with a triple double : 16 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists which was perhaps his best game of the season, all things considered. \u201cOnce our defense took a stand that\u2019s when the game turned in our favor,\u201d said Green. \u201cIf we can push the tempo and get stuff in transition, that\u2019s big for us and obviously that starts with stops.\u201d The Warriors had only one turnover and held the Pelicans to 30 percent shooting in the second quarter, which fueled Golden State\u2019s transition game. Durant and Thompson were straight fire with the jumper and they combined for 53 points in what amounted to three quarters worth of sweat. And that was a wrap. \u201cThat quarter was unacceptable,\u201d Rajon Rondo said. In some ways this result was understandable; the Pelicans are new to this; Davis is playing in the second round for the first time in his great career, and only Rondo brings championship chops. About the Warriors, Gentry said: \u201cThey\u2019ve done it before, and that\u2019s why I say you\u2019ve got to be very disciplined in what you do with these guys. If you make a mistake against them, they make you pay. They are very smart.\u201d Kerr used a smallish starting lineup without a natural center, sticking Green in the post, keeping JaVale McGee on the bench and going with a combination of Nick Young and Shaun Livingston in the swing spots. This allowed the Warriors to pace with the Pelicans, who ran the Blazers out of the first round . Yet in the superstar competition, the Pelicans are at a disadvantage, a margin that will only swell the next game. Therefore, did New Orleans miss out on its best opportunity to grab a game, while the Warriors were short a star? Jrue Holiday realizes the problems and challenges that a Curry-fortified team will pose for the Pelicans. He did the math. \u201cYou have to key on him as well as KD and Klay,\u201d said the Pelicans guard. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously another element of their team.\u201d At the same time, Thompson believes the Warriors need to chill on any urge to assume all will be well once the team is whole again. \u201cWe played well without Steph,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been as easy as it looks but we adjusted without him. Even if he does come back, it\u2019s a natural human emotion to be relaxed because we have so much coming back. That will be a test to not depend on Steph to save the day. We have playmakers all around. Just do this together. He\u2019s going to give us a huge boost but we can\u2019t relax.\u201d With the help of trusty Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who has the enviable duty of being the official and exclusive workout partner for one of the greatest shooters in league history, Curry hit jumper after jumper as the doors opened at Oracle. As usual, the routine drew a sizable group of onlookers from the stands, but this one seemed more important than others. Folks wanted and needed to know: Is Curry, after a month off, still splash-ready? Warm-ups can only tell so much. Yet the concentration, the rapid-fire dribble, the quick catch-and-shoot and the aim appeared pure. Seemingly everyone is awaiting the return of Curry except those who stand to suffer because of it. \u201cI\u2019m more excited as his brother that he\u2019s out there,\u201d said Durant. \u201cHe gets to play basketball, something that he loves to do. We\u2019ll see what happens next game.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Giannis Antetokounmpo will be on some MVP ballots and could very well be a First Team All-NBA selection this year. But in Game 7 on Saturday, he couldn\u2019t be the best player on the floor, because the best defense on the floor wouldn\u2019t let him. \u201cI\u2019m the best player on the court, both teams,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after Game 7, a 112-96 loss for his Milwaukee Bucks at the hands of the Boston Celtics. \u201cBut from the start, the game plan was to stop me.\u201d The Celtics didn\u2019t completely shut down Antetokounmpo in Game 7, but they held him in check . His line: 22 points on 7-for-17 shooting, with five assists. Not terrible, just not the numbers you\u2019d expect from the best player on the floor in a Game 7.  The Celtics didn\u2019t give him much space. Antetokounmpo was able to catch the ball the elbow in the Bucks\u2019 offense, but when he faced up against Semi Ojeleye, Al Horford was always lingering a few feet away, willing to leave his own man open to help keep Antetokounmpo from getting to the basket. Horford was Antetokounmpo\u2019s primary defender early in the series, but the Celtics turned to Ojeleye in Game 5, with Horford acting as the help man over the last three games. \u201cTheir defense loaded up to [Antetokounmpo] quite a few times,\u201d Bucks head coach Joe Prunty said. \u201cThen it\u2019s a decision. Can he make the play at the rim? Can he make the kick-out? I still think he was aggressive trying to make the right plays.\u201d \u201cI thought the team effort on him was outstanding,\u201d Celtics head coach Brad Stevens added. \u201cI thought [Ojeleye] was unbelievable, in these three games, defensively against Giannis. And then everybody else was just a little bit better than they\u2019ve been against him, and made him earn everything.\u201d The Celtics didn\u2019t give him space, and he didn\u2019t force anything either. Maybe that\u2019s what the Bucks needed, but maybe Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t there yet in his development. Without a reliable jump shot \u2013 he had the third worst effective field goal percentage from outside the paint among 207 players with at least 200 field goal attempts from the outside this season \u2013 there\u2019s a clear game plan for every team trying to defend him: Stay in front of him and make him a shooter. And on Saturday, the other Bucks were unable to take advantage of the extra attention paid to their star. Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates shot just 10-for-31 from outside the paint.  \u201cThey were trying to make me uncomfortable all night,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cBut it\u2019s Game 7. You got to play through that. I was just trying to make plays.\u201d Khris Middleton capped an incredible shooting series (effective field goal percentage of 71 percent) with 17 points in the fourth quarter, but it was too little, too late, and Eric Bledsoe allowed Terry Rozier to get open too often on the other end of the floor. The Celtics lost Kyrie Irving before the series started and lost Jaylen Brown at the end of the first half on Saturday. But they remained the resilient group they\u2019ve been all season, led by Horford, who was a lot more than a help defender in Game 7. Indeed, he looked like the best player on this particular night, tying his career playoff high with 26 points on 13-for-17 shooting and helping limit the Bucks to just four offensive rebounds. More amazing was that Milwaukee was held to zero fast break points, two nights after registering 25 in Game 6. The Celtics\u2019 ability to keep Antetokounmpo in check started in transition and it helped that Boston shot 54 percent and committed only four live ball turnovers. There just weren\u2019t many opportunities for the Bucks to run. Transition defense will continue to be a point of emphasis in the conference semifinals, where the Celtics will meet Ben Simmons and the Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks, meanwhile, will begin the search for a coach who can get the most out of their star and his supporting cast. Antetokounmpo will continue to put in the work. He\u2019s come a long way since he was drafted in 2013, he\u2019s still got a long way to go, and he\u2019s just 23 years old. \u201cGiannis\u2019 ceiling is tremendous and he\u2019s getting better every day,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cThat\u2019s a scary thing for everybody in the league to think about.\u201d They just won\u2019t have to think about it for another few months."},{"id":46979,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/win-or-leave-home-lebron-james-facing-extreme-game-7-vs-indiana-pacers","date":"2018-04-29","title":"Win-or-leave home? LeBron James facing extreme Game 7 vs. Indiana Pacers","content":"* Today on ABC: Pacers at Cavaliers (1 ET) CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 LeBron James is on the brink of his earliest NBA playoff exit \u2013 and maybe another departure from Cleveland. This Game 7 has a win-or-leave-home element . After being bloodied and blown off the floor in Game 6 by the Pacers in Indianapolis, James and the Cavaliers staggered home with their roller-coaster season possibly headed toward a crash. Only a win on Sunday over Indiana will prevent elimination and kick-start a summer in Cleveland that will center on James, who can opt out of his $35.6 million contract and become a free agent on July 1. The stakes couldn\u2019t be much higher. It\u2019s the kind of game James lives to play. \u201dIt\u2019s just the love of the game and wanting to be remembered,\u201d James said following a demoralizing 121-87 loss Friday night. \u201dGame 7, I always said, is the two greatest words in sports. Us having a Game 7 on our floor, our fans are going to be truly excited to be a part of that. And hope our guys are excited about that as well, and understand that just don\u2019t take those moments for granted. \u201dI\u2019ve been a part of Game 7s for quite a while now and it\u2019s just something that you wish you can get back and when you\u2019re done playing the game.\u201d James has never lost a first-round series, going 12-0 with many of them sweeps on his way to winning three championships and seven straight appearances in the Finals. But nothing has come easy for the 33-year-old or the Cavs, whose regular-season flaws \u2013 suspect defense, no reliable second scoring option \u2013 have been exposed by the young-and-hungry Pacers. Indiana has taken it to Cleveland, and the fifth-seeded Pacers believe they can win one more and finally take down James, who has ended their season three times in the playoffs since 2013. \u201dWe were confident even before this series started,\u201d said Indiana All-Star Victor Oladipo, who snapped out of a shooting slump to score 28 in Game 6. \u201dWe\u2019re still confident now. Game 7 is going to be a hostile environment. It\u2019s going to be very emotional. But we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge. It\u2019s going to be a dog fight. \u201dWe know they\u2019re going to be ready. And we have to be, too.\u201d Before losing Game 6, James\u2019 teams had won 11 straight close-out games. The streak ending was hardly his fault. The four-time MVP scored 22 points with seven rebounds and five rebounds in 31 minutes before sitting out the entire fourth quarter to rest when it became obvious the Cavs were not coming back. James has been brilliant throughout the series, averaging 32.7 points, 10.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists. Trouble is, he\u2019s been doing it all by himself. Kevin Love, Cleveland\u2019s other All-Star, is averaging just 11 points and shooting 32 percent (22 of 68) from the field. Love has been playing with a sprained left thumb, but his shot is broken. Love scored seven points in Game 6 on 3-of-10 shooting \u2013 the third time he\u2019s scored 10 points or fewer in the series \u2013 and he also took a beating from Indiana\u2019s bigs. After trading Kyrie Irving to Boston last summer and then dealing Isaiah Thomas, who was supposed to replace Irving, at the Feb. 8 deadline, the Cavs were counting on Love to pick up his game in the playoffs. They\u2019re still waiting. \u201dIt\u2019s not me, but it\u2019s not about me, either,\u201d Love said softly following Game 6. \u201dI\u2019ve done a lot of other good things. I know you guys will talk about the offense, but I just got to find a way to impact the game in different ways.\u201d Fortunately, the Cavs have James, who is 4-2 in Game 7s and hasn\u2019t lost a series finale since 2008 in his first stint with Cleveland. He\u2019s averaged 33.2 points, 9.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists in Game 7, and he needs to eclipse those numbers to keep the Cavs\u2019 season alive and delay a decision that already has Cleveland fans on edge."},{"id":46957,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-philadelphia-76ers-eastern-conference-semifinals-preview","date":"2018-04-29","title":"Series preview: New-school Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers re-start playoff rivalry","content":" The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers each have one of the league\u2019s best rookies and one of its best second-year players, with even more young talent beyond that. That talent is only going to get better and both teams are set up to rule the Eastern Conference for the next few years. But for one of these teams of the future, the present includes a trip to the conference finals \u2026 and maybe more. The Sixers have been on a tear over the last six weeks, ending the regular season on a 16-game winning streak and defeating the Miami Heat in five games in the first round, with Rookie of the Year favorite Ben Simmons averaging a triple-double over that 20-1 stretch. The Celtics have been the most resilient team in the league, overcoming a myriad of injuries to play the league\u2019s best defense in the regular season and dispatch the Milwaukee Bucks in a seven-game series . The Celtics got Marcus Smart back for the last three games of the first round, but remain shorthanded with Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward out for the season. Generating offense without Irving has been difficult and it may remain so against the size of the Sixers. Of course, defense has taken the Celtics this far, and it remains ever reliable. The Sixers struggled to score against it in the regular season, but it\u2019s been more than three months since these teams last faced each other and a lot has changed for Philadelphia since then. 1. How have the Celtics managed to survive offensively without Kyrie Irving? In spurts. They ranked 10th offensively (106 points scored per 100 possessions) in the first round, with three games in which they scored less than a point per possession. By switching screens, the Bucks flattened the Celtics out for a few games. After averaging 39 points in the restricted area in Games 1-3, the Celtics averaged just 25 in Games 4-6, before finding a way to get back to the basket in Game 7 to the tune of 50 points in the restricted area. 2. Can Boston slow the Sixers down? Pace could be the key to the series. No team saw a bigger increase in pace from the regular season to the first round than the Heat, because the Sixers controlled the pace over those five games. The Celtics had some trouble in dealing with Giannis Antetokounmpo on the break in the first round, but kept him out of transition in Game 7, in part because they had their best shooting game of the series. Transition defense starts with offensive execution. 3. Is Joel Embiid back at 100 percent? After suffering a broken orbital bone on March 28 , Embiid missed the last eight games of the regular season and the first two games of the first round. Upon his return to the lineup in Game 3 , he was a force on defense; The Heat shot just 5-for-19 at the rim when he was there to protect it. But he was a little rusty on offense, shooting just 42 percent and turning the ball over 15 times in three games. If the rust has worn off and he has adjusted to wearing his protective mask, the Sixers\u2019 offense will only be more dangerous than it was in the first round. 11.2 \u2014 The Sixers averaged 11.2 miles traveled on offense per 24 minutes of possession against Miami, most in the first round. Philly has surrounded its two young stars with shooters ( five different Sixers attempted at least 17 3-pointers over their five-game series with Miami ) and they never stop moving. The Sixers move the ball (they also led the first round with 387 passes per 24 minutes of possession), they move bodies, and they\u2019re difficult to guard. The Celtics had the No. 1 defense in the regular season and the 95 points per 100 possessions they held the Sixers to in the season series the fewest Philly scored against any opponent . With more size on the perimeter, the Celtics match up better with the Sixers than Miami did. But the Sixers\u2019 offense has improved dramatically since the last time these two teams faced each other (Jan. 18). The Celtics have home-court advantage, and they made the most of it in the first round, winning all four games at TD Garden. They shut down the Sixers\u2019 offense in the regular season, but these Sixers are not the Sixers of January, and they won the first two road playoff games that four of their five starters ever played in. The Celtics can slow the Philly offense down somewhat, but Boston probably doesn\u2019t have enough offense of its own to win four games.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr, however, added, \u201cI fully expect him to play Tuesday night\u201d for Game 2. \u201dJust made the decision based on giving him the extra few days and the fact he only scrimmaged yesterday,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dYou\u2019ve been out five weeks and we\u2019re playing in the playoffs, I don\u2019t think one scrimmage is enough, even though he feels great, he wants to play and pleaded his case.

Kerr, general manager Bob Myers and athletic trainer Chelsea Lane met with Curry and made a decision to keep him out. \u201dWe have to protect him from himself and his own competitive desire,\u201d Kerr said. Curry has not played since March 23 due to sprained left knee, but the Warriors still cruised to a 4-1 first-round series win over the Spurs. He would, however, boost their abnormally poor outside shooting . Entering Saturday night, the Warriors ranked 13th out of the 16 playoff teams in 3-point makes per contest and 3-point percentage. Curry ranked first in makes (4.2 per game) and 13th in accuracy during the regular season. \u201dWe practiced the whole week with the understanding that Steph was probably going to play,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. \u201dAnd he will play.

They took care of business in the first round, dispatching the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. They\u2019re just one step away from possibly facing the champion Golden State Warriors in the playoff matchup that we\u2019ve all been anticipating for months. But this step promises to be much tougher than the last one, because the second best team in the Western Conference over the last three months hasn\u2019t been the Warriors. It\u2019s been the Utah Jazz. The Jazz won 29 of their last 35 games in the regular season, with the league\u2019s best defense (by a wide margin) and the 11th-ranked offense over that time. And in the first round, they beat a team (Oklahoma City) with Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Steven Adams, and home-court advantage. They have an elite defense, they have a budding star in rookie Donovan Mitchell, and they play together. It\u2019s a matchup of the No. 2 offense and the No. 2 defense in the regular season, as well as a meeting of the favorite for MVP (James Harden) and the favorite for Defensive Player of the Year (Rudy Gobert).

The 2017-18 season wasn\u2019t designed to be this way, or end this way, not with Russ taking more shots than a boxer\u2019s chin, and certainly not with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony being rendered useless, mostly by their own doing with help from the Utah Jazz. No, when the Oklahoma City Thunder went all in last summer and cooked up their version of a Big Three, they were built at least for May. Well, in a sense, in the final frantic life-support moments of their season, it was indeed May Day. *  Thunder-Jazz series coverage They missed chances, repeatedly and disastrously, while trying to extend Game 6 against the Jazz. There were five cracks on a 50-second possession while down three points, and each shot taken by the Thunder looked more desperate than the previous one. Clang, they went, against the rim, against the backboard, until exhaustion and reality settled in and sent them home for the summer. And so, these are the scenes that will follow the Thunder into the offseason like a black cat: George turning into dust in the final game by passing up shots and getting shut down on others, scoring five points with six turnovers \u2026 Russ essentially and quite literally throwing up his hands by taking 43 shots, 27 more than George \u2026 \u2018Melo benched for all but nine minutes in the second half, towel draped over his slumped shoulders, for sure feeling flummoxed by this experiment here in the autumn of his career. And this: The fortified Thunder, over and out in the first round of the playoffs in six. Maybe this was their more reasonable destiny, anyway, because Russ, George and Anthony never appeared solid all season. Yes, there were sensational stretches and teases but the fact is OKC with Russ-George-Melo lasted just one game longer than OKC last season with just Russ. That\u2019s all that matters, right? The cold, hard bottom line, which must\u2019ve felt like concrete when the Thunder landed on it Friday? Not to dismiss the team that took them out; the Jazz are in many ways the anti-Thunder, with deliberate ball movement, defense that never takes a rest, and a lineup that lacks a single All-Star. They were brilliantly led in this series anyway by Donovan Mitchell, a rookie only by designation; he was the best player on the floor and crushed it in the close-out game with 22 of his 38 points in the third quarter when everything changed. Yet: This was more a statement about the loser than the winner. And because this was a one-and-done by OKC in the playoffs, the next order of business is to see if this Big Three experiment is one-and-done, period. It\u2019s all about George and his feelings about playing next to Russ, about living in Oklahoma City and being a member of the Thunder as he approaches free agency this summer. The buzzer Friday didn\u2019t just end OKC\u2019s season, it signaled the start of George\u2019s decision. Understand what\u2019s at stake here: To get George, the Thunder traded Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, which means OKC gave the Pacers a chance to do what George couldn\u2019t while in Indiana: Beat LeBron James in the playoffs, with the seventh game of that first-round series looming. How empty will that trade look if George becomes the second star to leave OKC in three years? Salary cap-wise, the Thunder have limits for how they can improve next season, meaning George must believe this current group can do better with just a few minor cosmetic touches. Meanwhile, the Lakers will surely chuckle at that, maybe a team like the Sixers will, too, if they come knocking. Of course, George wasn\u2019t prepared to make an announcement just hours after getting bounced, although what he did say sounded good for OKC. \u201cIt was an amazing season. really a learning experience, playing off Russ, playing off \u2018Melo, seeing what potential is like,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was great, a lot to be happy about. The fans, the city, and the organization have been unbelievable. I would love to remain a Thunder but that\u2019s what this summer is for, so we\u2019ll address that this summer.\u201d And this, regarding Russ: \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable, just a standup guy. amazing person. That\u2019s how you can describe Russ, as a friend and brother. One of the best teammates I\u2019ve had by far.\u201d Finally, this, explaining how a first-round elimination wasn\u2019t a game-changer or deal-breaker in his eyes: \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d he said. \u201cTalent wise and all that yes, but it\u2019s our first year playing together. I think we have to figure out the in between stuff. That can take some time to unravel and to become a championship team.\u201d Sounds nice \u2026 but plenty can change in a few months, including George\u2019s mind. He shot just 2-for-16 in Game 6 and for some reason wasn\u2019t the force he was in the previous game, where he tag-teamed with Westbrook to rally OKC from 25 points down. And yet, OKC will pay him handsomely nonetheless. \u201cOne game I just so happened to miss shots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lose by five points. That\u2019s going to happen over a series. You\u2019re going to have a bad shooting night. It doesn\u2019t make me feel unaccomplished.\u201d For \u2018Melo, this series and perhaps this season was a shock to the system for a 10-time All-Star. He morphed into a third banana and managed to slip on a peel far too often in this playoff series. In important stretches of games, he was benched for Alex Abrines and Jerami Grant. His confidence appeared to reflect his body language. There were no clear-outs and isolations for Anthony, suddenly a $27 million role player. And what of Westbrook? He delivered another triple-double season, becoming the first to do so in NBA history, although his efficiency took a noticeable hit. His energy and his will never wavered and he was defiant until the end, true to his DNA. With George in a fog and \u2018Melo literally and figuratively checking out \u2014 on one change of possession, \u2018Melo didn\u2019t even run the floor \u2014 Westbrook went mostly solo. \u201cYou\u2019ve you got to fight, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just playing the game. We just weren\u2019t able to make the run that we needed.\u201d As he walked off the floor at halftime, Westbrook did find time to angrily confront a fan who shouted at him and also confronted another fan once the game ended, and Westbrook was in no mood to issue apologies, potential fines be damned. \u201cHere in Utah, a lot of disrespectful, vulgar things are said to players here with these fans, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly disrespectful. (They) talk about your families, about your kids. It\u2019s disrespectful to the game. I\u2019m tired of going out here and play and letting the fans say whatever the hell they want to say. I\u2019m not down with that. If I was on the street, they wouldn\u2019t just come up to me and say anything crazy, \u2018cause I don\u2019t play that (bleep).\u201d Curiously, Westbrook flashed no such anger about how the Thunder\u2019s six-game playoff stint cratered. Nor did he show any fear over possibly losing George. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the season as a whole and go from there,\u201d Westbrook said. He wasn\u2019t the only one staring at a crystal ball and seeing Paul George in it. Thunder coach Billy Donovan added: \u201cThere\u2019s great optimism from me about what the team could end up being going forward.\u201d Maybe those are words used to numb the pain, or words meant for a certain free agent to hear. In almost every reasonable measuring stick, however, this season didn\u2019t quite become what the Thunder thought when they added two stars and raised hope. Well, the honest truth is this Big Three couldn\u2019t win the Big One. As in round. Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Rudy Gobert is the presumptive Kia Defensive Player of the Year, having made a huge impact on that end of the floor for the league\u2019s No. 2 defense upon returning from injury in late January. The two will meet in the Western Conference semifinals in what will be the best elite-offense-vs.-elite-defense matchup of the postseason thus far. Of course, both the Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz have found success on both ends of the floor. In eliminating the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games, the Rockets held the Wolves\u2019 top-five offense to six fewer points per 100 possessions than it scored in the regular season. And in ousting the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games, the Jazz scored almost two more than OKC\u2019s top-10 defense allowed in the regular season. The Rockets and Jazz are a combined 69-14 since Jan. 24, by far the two best teams in the West over that time. But the regular season series between them was about as lopsided as four games between two good teams could get. The total point differential (the Rockets outscored the Jazz by 70 points over the four games) was the fifth largest in any season series this season and the largest in any series between playoff teams. And the final meeting ( Feb. 26 ) came in the middle of a 21-2 stretch for Utah (and was the second game of a back-to-back for Houston), so it wasn\u2019t like the Rockets only caught the Jazz before they hit their stride. No team scored more efficiently against the Jazz this season than the Rockets did and Harden was able to get to the free throw line often, even with Gobert on the floor. But the playoffs are a new season, the Jazz looked strong in the first round (discounting the last 20 minutes of Game 5), and Donovan Mitchell is turning into a star on the playoff stage. But the Rockets have home-court advantage, and they\u2019ve won 23 of their last 24 games at the Toyota Center. Three quick questions and answers 1. How will the Jazz defend Harden? If Ricky Rubio\u2019s hamstring injury (suffered in Game 6 vs. Oklahoma City) affects his availability, Utah\u2019s options will be limited. Joe Ingles should get the assignment, but the initial defender on the MVP favorite isn\u2019t as important as how the Jazz defend Houston pick-and-rolls as a team. The Rockets will challenge Utah\u2019s desire to keep Gobert near the rim; they forced him to switch onto their guards quite a bit in the regular season. The Jazz will surely mix up their pick-and-roll coverage over the course of the series, and the key for every Utah defender who finds himself on an island with either Harden or Chris Paul is to stay in front of them. If they can\u2019t, the Jazz defense will be scrambling and Houston\u2019s shooters will get better looks than they got in the first round. 2. Who has the advantage on the other end of the floor? The Jazz make the most of what they have offensively. Mitchell gives them juice off the dribble, and they move bodies and the ball. The Rockets will switch most screens to try to deactivate that ball movement, unafraid of whatever mismatches the Jazz might want to exploit. Getting Luc Mbah a Moute back from a dislocated right shoulder at some point in the series would help the Rockets\u2019 defense, but they defended Minnesota pretty well without him. The Rockets had the sixth-ranked defense this season and were particularly good at keeping their opponents away from the free throw line and off the offensive glass. 3. Is it all about how well the Rockets shoot from beyond the arc? Well, yes. But 3-point percentage is critical for both teams. The Rockets ranked seventh in the league in points scored in the restricted area and at the free throw line, but they still took more than half of their shots from 3-point range in the regular season (and 49 percent in the first round). Thus far this season, they\u2019re 51-6 when they\u2019ve made more than 33 percent of their 3-point attempts and 18-12 when they haven\u2019t. The Jazz don\u2019t shoot 3s at nearly the same volume, but still need to capitalize on its catch-and-shoot attempts when they get them. They\u2019re 35-7 when they\u2019ve shot 37 percent or better from 3-point range and 17-29 when they haven\u2019t. The number to know 8.6 \u2014 The Rockets averaged just 8.6 turnovers per 100 possessions against Minnesota, by far the lowest rate in the first round and down from 13.8 per 100 in the regular season . The Rockets ranked second in effective field goal percentage and third in free throw rate this year, and the better they take care of the ball, the more shots at the basket (and the more trips to the line) they\u2019ll get. They didn\u2019t shoot particularly well until Game 5 against the Wolves, but their lack of turnovers kept their offense efficient enough to get through the first round. The Jazz ranked fifth in the regular season in opponent turnover rate , forcing 15.2 per 100 possessions. They forced 17.0 in four games against Houston , but that was about all they did well defensively in the regular season series. Making the pick The Jazz impressed in dispatching the Thunder in six games. They have an elite defense and a cohesive offense fueled by a budding star. They will not be an easy out. But the Rockets are a much tougher challenge than what the Jazz saw in the first round, a team that won\u2019t settle for bad shots and will be more disciplined on the other end of the floor. We\u2019ve been waiting all season for a Houston-Golden State matchup in the Western Conference Finals, and the Rockets should hold up their end of the bargain. Rockets in 6.

The others are Wilt Chamberlain (53 points), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (46 points) and Magic Johnson (42 points). \u2022 Mitchell is the first rookie to lead his team in scoring for a series in which they beat a higher seeded team since Alonzo Mourning led Charlotte past Boston in a 1993 first-round series. \u2022 Mitchell is the third rookie over the past 35 seasons with multiple 30-point games in a series, joining Mourning (twice in 1993, first round) and Michael Jordan (twice in 1985, first round). \u2022 Mitchell has scored 171 points in first six career playoff games, the third most by a rookie in NBA history behind Lew Alcindor (216 in 1970) and Wilt Chamberlain in (199 in 1960)."},{"id":40724,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-career-game-7s","date":"2018-04-28","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James thrives in elimination games, particularly Game 7s","content":" The Cavaliers\u2019 first-round matchup with the Pacers has been much tougher than they were hoping, with the two teams set for a decisive Game 7 on Sunday (1 p.m. ET, ABC). They can at least take comfort in the fact that perhaps the greatest elimination-game player in NBA history will lead them into battle. LeBron James enters the contest having played in no fewer than 19 elimination games during his career, boasting a 10-9 record. While that might not sound overly impressive, keep in mind that Michael Jordan, for example, was only 6-7 in such games. Granted, Jordan\u2019s Bulls rarely had to play elimination games once they reached their championship peak. But the point remains: A winning record in the most pressure-packed, important games of one\u2019s career is impressive. Even more impressive is James\u2019 performance in those games. His 33-point average in elimination games is the best of any player in history, once again besting even Jordan himself. (Jordan averaged \u201conly\u201d 31.3 points in his 13 elimination games.)

A warm-and-fuzzy embrace nearly 18,000 strong. And a clear edge from being the desperate team Friday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. All those advantages will be gone Sunday when the Indiana Pacers face the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference first-round series. They will, in fact, be swapped out for several sizable disadvantages: Road court. More than 20,000 fans at Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena vehemently and vociferously aligned against them. A level of desperation pushing back from the Cavaliers that will equal or surpass what drove the Pacers t o their startling 121-87 dominance in Game 6. And needless to say, LeBron James, heels planted, determined to win rather than go home. The best player in the league eats close-out and elimination games for breakfast and hasn\u2019t had his season end in April since 2005. Indiana\u2019s Victor Oladipo was a seventh grader back then. But Friday, he was an All-Star, this season\u2019s presumptive Most Improve Player and the primary reason the Pacers had Cleveland skedaddling home to Ohio in search of answers and a friendlier gym. Oladipo had a game-high 28 points with 13 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals. It was the first such triple-double in NBA playoff history hitting those totals in all four categories. More than that, it was loud message to the rest of the Pacers of \u201cGet on my back, fellas, we\u2019re going back to Cleveland.\u201d Oladipo, after scoring 32 and 22 points in the series\u2019 first two games, had sputtered and gasped his way \u2013 as a shooter, anyway \u2013 to 12-of-50 from the field, averaging just 15.7 points in Games 3, 4 and 5. Near the end Wednesday night in Cleveland, he had a hero moment that backfired badly, his driving layup getting blocked \u2013 technically, goaltended without a whistle \u2013 by James. Rather than show up aggrieved 48 hours later, Oladipo showed up aggressive. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid who absorbs what you try to tell him [and] tries to do,\u201d Indiana coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cWhen teams are double-teaming him [and] we\u2019re telling him to get the ball out \u2013 he did that. When he has single coverage, \u2018Take your shot. Attack.\u2019 He did that . He\u2019s having to play both sides of the ball, guarding [Kyle] Korver. \u2026 He just continues to come out and show growth and improvement.\u201d Oladipo scored 10 of his points in the third quarter, when Indiana thumbed its nose at any Cavaliers adjustments by almost instantly pushing a 10-point halftime lead to 15. He was out there for the entire period, going hard to the rim to dunk the ball, lest someone block\/goaltend him this time. By the start of the fourth quarter, the Pacers were up 92-67. And James was done for the night, his time better spent on the bench, saving something for Sunday. \u201cHe got some transition baskets off our turnovers,\u201d James said of Oladipo. \u201c[He was able] to see the ball go through the hoop. Had a couple of dribble-in threes without no one around him. We just can\u2019t have that versus a guy like that.\u201d When asked about the hard times of the previous three games and, specifically, the jarring end of Game 5, Oladipo said: \u201cYou just live and you learn. I learned a lot from that play and that game, and just try to better myself from one day to the next, one game to the next. You get over it \u2013 you can\u2019t really go back and change that situation or that game or that play.\u201d The Pacers\u2019 court leader is clearly calculated and restrained in his remarks, refusing to offer any red meat upon which the Cavs might pounce for inspiration. But Oladipo did lavish some praise on the teammates who have rallied behind him in his first season in Indiana. Together, they overachieved in the regular season and, in forcing Game 7 against the defending East champs, they\u2019ve already done that again this postseason. \u201cGreat men of high character\u201d was how he described Thaddeus Young, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic and all the rest (yes, presumably even Lance Stephenson). \u201cWho have been resilient not only on the court but off the court as well,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cThey\u2019re just applying it to the game. All of us, when we get together, can do something special.\u201d The comments and the situation were in stark contrast to what James and the Cavaliers are experiencing. There\u2019s a distinct sense of \u201chim and them\u201d about their team, understandable given the number of newer, unproven players on Cleveland\u2019s roster and how inconsistent that supporting cast has been in this series. Pressed into heavier point guard duties with starter George Hill (back) sidelined for the past three games, and despite a nasty cut above his left eye courtesy of Young\u2019s elbow, James with 22 points, five rebounds, seven assists and four turnovers. But he knew the math most foul on this night: 29 points scored by Indiana off Cavs\u2019 turnovers and 35 points yielded to the Pacers\u2019 fast breaks. James shrugged off a couple of questions about those guys\u2019 readiness and learning curve as playoff performers, then finally engaged deep into his postgame media session. \u201cYou guys ask me every day, \u2018Is there anything you can tell your guys for Game 1? Is there anything you can tell your guys for Game 2? What can you tell your guys for Game 3?\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same answer: I mean, just throw the ball up and let\u2019s go out and play. \u201cIt\u2019s the postseason. There\u2019s not much I can give you from my experience. There\u2019s not much people can tell you. You\u2019ve just got to go out and live in the moment.\u201d Pressed into heavier point guard duties with starter George Hill (back) sidelined for the past three games, and in spite of a nasty cut above his left eye courtesy of Young\u2019s elbow, James also reminded his audience \u201cwe\u2019re a newer team than they are, if you look at it. They\u2019ve been here all year. Our team just got put together in late February.\u201d And when asked about Kevin Love\u2019s struggles \u2013 22-of-68, 32.4 percent, averaging 11.0 points \u2013 the Cavaliers star called Love \u201ca huge part of our success or our non-success.\u201d He added: \u201cWe try to go to him, we want to go to him. Obviously, we can\u2019t make the shots for him.\u201d So what James, Oladipo and everybody else said in anticipation of Game 7 likely will prove true. There will be pressure on both sides Sunday. It just won\u2019t be the same pressure. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

The Toronto Raptors\u2019 second possession of the fourth was brutal, like Jakob-Poeltl-pull-up-three-with-one-second-on-the-shot-clock brutal. A minute later, Pascal Siakam bailed them out of another ugly possession with a 15-foot, one-handed turnaround jumper. Game 6 of their first round series with the Washington Wizards was tied. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan were on the bench, and an outside observer may have wondered why Casey didn\u2019t immediately turn to his All-Stars upon witnessing those two possessions. At that point, DeRozan had played just 30 minutes and Lowry had played just 25. The point guard could have been on the floor for the entire fourth quarter and he would have played fewer minutes on Friday than he averaged last season. But Casey didn\u2019t flinch. He stuck with the five-man bench unit that has been winning him games since October. And it won him another one on Friday, pushing the Raptors into the conference semifinals with a 102-92 victory in Game 6. \u201c It was ugly,\u201d Casey admitted about the first couple of minutes of the fourth. \u201cIt took them a little while. And usually, those guys have some ugly possessions. But sooner or later, they usually figure it out.\u201d They figured it out on Friday, to the tune of an 11-2 run that turned a five-point deficit into a four-point lead. Fred VanVleet hit a late-clock three. Poeltl got to the line after grabbing an offensive rebound. Then Delon Wright found C.J. Miles for a trail three that forced a timeout for Washington. That was another opportunity for Casey to turn back to one or both of his All-Stars. But Toronto came out of the timeout with the same five reserves, and they held onto the lead against Washington\u2019s starters. Wright had a pretty, isolation spin-move against Marcin Gortat. Siakam swatted Bradley Beal and threw down a put-back dunk. Poeltl even contested a couple of shots without fouling. \u201cMost of the time, that group has to be unscripted,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe more you try to set things up with that group and take away their imagination, whatever it is, it hurts them a little bit.\u201d \u201cThey turned the pressure up a little bit,\u201d VanVleet said of the Washington defense early in the fourth. \u201cBut we just kept doing the same thing, kept moving, got into our sets a little bit more, got some back-cuts and some DHO action just to loosen them up a little bit. It took us a couple of possessions to adjust.\u201d A couple of possessions that Casey afforded them. This was a coach that, over the last four years, always had one All-Star on the floor, DeRozan to end the first and third quarters, Lowry to start the second and fourth. And the East\u2019s best record over those four years says that staggering the stars\u2019 minutes worked just fine. But this year, in addition to changing both the offense and defense, Casey changed the rotation, going with five reserves on the floor together. And that worked even better. The lineup of VanVleet, Wright, Miles, Siakam and Poeltl outscored its opponents by 17 points per 100 possessions in the regular season, the second best mark among 29 lineups that played at least 300 minutes together. Lowry averaged just 32.2 minutes per game, the fewest in the last five seasons. DeRozan averaged just 33.9, the fewest since his rookie year. With fresher stars and a bevy of options off the bench, the Raptors were the best fourth quarter team in the league, outscoring their opponents by 8.3 points per 100 possessions in the final 12 minutes of regulation. Something was missing in Games 1-5 of this series, though. VanVleet suffered a right shoulder sprain in the last game of the regular season and tried to play in Game 2, but wasn\u2019t ready. And statistically, what was the best bench in the regular season was the third worst bench in the playoffs through Game 5. But after nine more days of recovery, VanVleet was in the game to start the second quarter on Friday, helping the Raptors cut a 10-point deficit to two and allowing both Lowry and DeRozan to rest for the first six minutes of the period. \u201cH e was the difference,\u201d Casey said of VanVleet. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the engine. The toughness. That little birdie on the shoulder. I thought it really propelled Pascal and those other guys to give them a sense of confidence.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a different energy,\u201d Miles said of having all five of the \u201cbench mob\u201d together, \u201cIt\u2019s a comfortable thing. We have been doing it all year and we have just a camaraderie, a good energy. There\u2019s a lot of things we can do without having to say it out loud just because we have played together for so long.\u201d And in the final period, when John Wall (40 minutes) and Bradley Beal (43 minutes) appeared to run out of gas, the Raptors\u2019 stars were fresh. Lowry checked back in with 6:15 left in the fourth and carried the Raptors home, scoring eight points as the Raptors put the Wizards away. Siakam and Wright stayed on the floor for all of what was a 29-14, series-deciding fourth quarter. Lowry said afterward that he felt \u201cgreat\u201d down the stretch. It took him a while to buy into play fewer minutes this season, but he eventually saw the benefits, for the team and for himself. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s showing in the playoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to go out there and play with more energy, more spunk, more everything.\u201d Asked if, after those ugly possessions early in the fourth, he wanted to jump off the bench and check into the game, Lowry was clear. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been the team we\u2019ve been all year. We\u2019ve let those guys figure it out. And that\u2019s why they\u2019ve played so well.\u201d It\u2019s a trust that has been built over six months. And it didn\u2019t go away after a couple of ugly possessions. \u201cHe let us work through that and it paid off,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of relationship we\u2019ve had all year. So, none of this stuff is new. It\u2019s just the biggest moment of the year, the biggest time, and the most pressure. We just got to keep performing.\u201d They\u2019ll have that opportunity in the conference semis, where they\u2019ll meet the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Indiana Pacers . This is the most complete team the Raptors have ever had, and they looked like it on Friday, with the best bench in basketball back at full strength. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry is impatient and eager to get back in a game for the Golden State Warriors, yet he knows it\u2019s not worth risking re-injuring his left knee by pushing his return too soon. The two-time MVP on Friday went through his first 5-on-5 scrimmage since the injury but coach Steve Kerr wasn\u2019t ready to proclaim Curry a go for Saturday night \u2013 that might not be decided until after the morning shootaround. Kerr listed Curry\u2019s status as questionable for a second straight day ahead of Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals against the New Orleans Pelicans at Oracle Arena. \u201dStill to be determined,\u201d Curry said. \u201dThey come up with those snazzy words for a reason \u2013 doubtful, questionable, probable. I\u2019ve learned a lot about what those words mean this year. Just trying to work my way up, do what I need to do, do whatever Chelsea (Lane) and the rest of the athletic training staff and coach needs to see to get me back out there. That\u2019s the only thing I can really focus on right now. It is good to be back actually playing basketball and doing basketball things.\u201d Curry, Kerr and Lane spoke in depth after Friday\u2019s scrimmage, which wasn\u2019t visible to media members with a curtain blocking one court at team headquarters. On Thursday, Curry resumed full practice with contact but Kerr wanted to see how Curry responded after consecutive intense days of on-court work before he and the training staff decided when to let Curry return. \u201dA big part of this is how he turns up tomorrow after a night\u2019s rest,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dIt\u2019s the first time he\u2019s scrimmaged in six weeks, five weeks, whatever it is. It\u2019s not as simple as he feels good, throw him out there. It\u2019s more about give him a few days, see how he responds from there.\u201d There was still no date for Game 2 of the best-of-seven series, though Curry was hoping if he couldn\u2019t play Saturday that the game would be at least Tuesday \u2013 not Monday \u2013 to give him a better chance. He nearly feels like himself again, moving the way he\u2019s used to during a game. Curry isn\u2019t sure what kind of minutes to expect initially when he does return but figures he will discuss that with Kerr ahead of time. \u201dI\u2019m getting there,\u201d he said. \u201dMy knee feels pretty good. I don\u2019t have any pain with doing things I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d Curry wore compression leggings Friday to protect his sprained knee, which has sidelined him since the injury March 23. It was bad luck given that\u2019s the same day he returned from a six-game absence because of a hurt right ankle. He was happy to not need a brace he tried out Thursday. The Warriors eliminated the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the first-round series with a 99-91 win Tuesday night and Curry wants to make sure he doesn\u2019t disrupt any flow or momentum with the team on a roll. \u201dThe priority for us is to be the best team we can be,\u201d he said. \u201dWhen I\u2019m 100 percent healthy and doing what I need to do I obviously try to lead that charge but right now the conversations become how can you manage those minutes and still be productive and still have a cohesive lineup and flow to the game and all that type of stuff. That\u2019s what Coach has to think through.\u201d Curry said he wasn\u2019t trying to persuade Kerr or Lane to let him play Saturday. \u201dThere\u2019s no real politicking at all, it\u2019s not that serious. It\u2019s a matter of how you feel, can you do this, can you do that and check off all the boxes along the way,\u201d he said. \u201dOnce I get through all those checkpoints and have confidence in myself and my body I\u2019ll be out there, whether that\u2019s tomorrow night or Monday or Tuesday, whenever Game 2 is, that\u2019s the process that I\u2019m all too familiar with.\u201d"},{"id":40718,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-phoenix-suns-interview-james-borrego-steve-clifford","date":"2018-04-28","title":"Report: Phoenix Suns interview James Borrego, Steve Clifford for head coaching vacancy","content":" The Phoenix Suns\u2019 search for a new head coach continues.

They announced a few hours before the scheduled tipoff that Porter is sidelined indefinitely after having a medical procedure earlier Friday to prevent permanent damage to muscles in the leg because of compartment syndrome. Porter has averaged only 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists while making just five 3-pointers during the playoffs. He was Washington\u2019s third-leading scorer during the regular season, behind John Wall and Bradley Beal, averaging a career-high 14.7 points, along with 6.4 rebounds and 2.0 assists. He was third in the NBA in 3-point field-goal percentage at 44.1, another personal best. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a lot of things going offensively,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut I always felt that, any day now, he was going to have a bust-out game. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Top reserve Kelly Oubre Jr. moved into Washington\u2019s starting lineup to take Porter\u2019s spot. Brooks said he also expected Tomas Satoransky and Ty Lawson to see increased minutes off the bench. \u201cYou hate to hear that about a young man, to go down like that,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said about Porter, \u201cbut they have a lot of guys that can step in and play that role.\u201d Porter received a max contract last offseason, when he was a restricted free agent and the Wizards ended up matching the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 $106 million, four-year offer sheet for the forward. That came after Porter set career bests of 13.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals and a 3-point shooting percentage of 43.4. The Wizards drafted Porter third overall in 2013 out of Georgetown. Oubre has been averaging 10.6 points and 4.0 rebounds in the series, along with playing active defense. He was going to draw the tough assignment of guarding DeMar DeRozan in Game 6; Toronto\u2019s All-Star guard came into Friday putting up 28.8 points per game. But the Wizards also could use some better shooting from Oubre, who has been making only 41.5 percent of his field-goal attempts, including 3 for 16 \u2013 19 percent \u2013 on 3-pointers. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get opportunities. Hopefully he can knock some shots down to get some confidence. He hasn\u2019t shot the ball well for a while,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut he does a lot of other things. He\u2019s aggressive. He\u2019s an emotional player.

The champs fell off defensively this season and lost nine more games than they had in any of their other three seasons under coach Steve Kerr . More important is that the Warriors have been without Stephen Curry for 36 games, including all five in the first round. The two-time MVP is his team\u2019s most important player, the engine for what has been a historically good offense.

Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll walk through this series. The New Orleans Pelicans played their best basketball of the season in the first round, sweeping the No. 3-seeded Portland Trail Blazers by putting the clamps on Damian Lillard and running roughshod over a top-10 defense. The Pelicans themselves had a top-five defense after losing DeMarcus Cousins for the season and the No. 1 offense in the first round .

It wasn\u2019t just a matter of fending off a series-clinching by the visiting Celtics, who led 3-2 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference first-round series when the night began. It was more complicated and emotional than that, considering the 30-year-old arena is about to be shuttered and eventually demolished as the Bucks move into a massive, state-of-the-art, still-to-be-dubbed facility for the start of the 2018-19 NBA season. So Milwaukee did all the right things in beating Boston 97-86 and forcing Game 7 on Saturday, and still might never get another chance to defend this particular court in this particular building. If the series finale goes to the Celtics at TD Garden, the Bucks essentially will be homeless until the hard hats come off, the ribbons get cut and the Taj Mahoops immediately to the north opens for business. If, on the other hand, Milwaukee somehow manages to replicate in Boston the performances it has given at the Bradley Center \u2014 so far, the home team has won all six games in the series \u2014 the gray and largely non-descript joint at 4th and State St. will stay relevant at least for a couple more weeks. For accuracy\u2019s sake, then, the battle cry ought to be more along the lines of \u201cKeep home alive!\u201d Just how can Milwaukee, the East\u2019s No. 8 seed, go about that? By getting the individual excellence again of Giannis Antetokounmpo and by flexing the same sort of tenacious yet controlled defense that stymied so many Celtics shooters. Antetokounmpo, the 23-year-old All Star who\u2019s as elite as he is elongated, had scolded himself after Tuesday\u2019s Game 5 loss in Boston for not being assertive enough. Specifically, that meant not seeking out and taking more than 10 shots in more than 41 minutes. He scored only 16 points, nearly 11 below his season average and not hardly enough in a loss decided by five. This time, playing nearly identical minutes, Antetokounmpo took 23 shots, made 13 of them and scored 31 points, with 15 rebounds and four assists. The \u201cGreek Freak\u201d first made good on a pledge to himself to get \u201chis\u201d shots \u2014 ones he felt more comfortable launching \u2014 and then fulfilled the implicit promise he\u2019s made with his teammates and Bucks fans to muster all his skills as effectively as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think he forced anything,\u201d coach Joe Prunty said. \u201cHe knows the spots he needs to get to, but we also need to get him space around those spots.\u201d And while it might seem like a media obsession and lazy playoff marketing to drop all sorts of imperatives in a star player\u2019s lap \u2013 can LeBron or The Beard or Giannis come through? \u2014 there is plenty of history and evidence supporting the view that the best players must play their best at this point both in the season and in a series. \u201cIn the last game,\u201d Prunty said, \u201che was one assist shy of a triple-double \u2026 and everyone was saying that he wasn\u2019t aggressive.\u201d Antetokounmpo scored 20 of his points after halftime, 12 in the final quarter. That included a putback in which he reached high to claim teammate Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s missed layup, then dropped the ball through for an 89-81 lead with 3:08 to go, cooling the last of the Celtics\u2019 scrambles on the scoreboard. \u201cHe knows what he wants \u2014 it\u2019s humbling to see,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 Thon Maker said. \u201cWe know we can trust him. We know we can always go back to him. And now we know where his spots are, where he\u2019s going to shoot it, so we can always get him the ball there.\u201d The other side of Milwaukee\u2019s survival effort Thursday was its strong work choking off the inside on Boston. As currently constituted \u2014 that is, without Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward \u2014 the Celtics are perimeter-challenged, so that\u2019s where the Bucks defenders pushed them. In the two previous games at Bradley Center, Milwaukee had 12 and 14 blocked shots. By Thursday, the Celtics had gotten the message and shifted more to the outside \u2013 which didn\u2019t go well, evidenced by their 10-of-36 3-point shooting. They\u2019ve gone 62-for-177 (35 percent) from beyond the arc in the series and 28-for-89 (31.5 percent) in the three games they\u2019ve lost. The Bucks have played more aggressively in their three homes games, and harder overall than they have in Boston. It has had its impact on the Celtics\u2019 offensive tendencies. \u201cAny time we got stagnant, we weren\u2019t very good,\u201d coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cClearly [the Bucks\u2019] speed, length and athleticism affected us. \u201cThey\u2019re all coming into the paint,\u201d Stevens added. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to take the next best shot. We\u2019d like to take layups but they are converging. \u2026 Those guys have put us in those positions. I don\u2019t want to act like we can control everything. They did stuff to us that was very, very effective.  \u201cThis has been the same story for the most part here all three games. They just physically dominated us.\u201d In Boston? Nah, not so much. So the challenge for the Bucks \u2014 who already have been whistled for 33 more fouls than the Celtics in the series, while making 32 fewer free throws \u2014 is to do all the good stuff again, but this time on the road. It is, after all, the only way Milwaukee actually can keep home alive. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In the case of most professional athletes, they can be downright grim. They are a prelude to darkness and the bitter end, coming without regard to stats, status and what-you-used-to-be. The proud ones battle and fight and ignore the obvious signs anyway, and often, in the case of Carmelo Anthony, they\u2019re stuck in a temporary case of denial. This was in full view in the second half of Game 5 of the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Utah Jazz series. That\u2019s when Anthony was benched with the season on the line, which has happened, like, never before in his basketball life. As the Thunder rallied fiercely, historically actually, with Russell Westbrook and Paul George \u2014 two-thirds of the OKC big Three \u2014 rescuing OKC from a 25-point crater , Carmelo looked up the bench from his seat, stared toward coach Billy Donovan, waiting for a signal that never came. Sometimes in these situations, while the coach is busy studying the floor, the lead assistant coach is the point man for substitutions. In OKC, such respect is given to Maurice Cheeks \u2014 the freshly-appointed basketball Hall of Famer. Anthony turned to Cheeks. Cheeks turned the other cheek. And so, the pride and ego of a 10-time All-Star and one of the most dangerous scorers of the last two decades surfaced and erupted. Melo took his frustrations out on Cheeks, raising his voice, demanding to be inserted into a game that had already flipped drastically in OKC\u2019s favor without him. It was a bad look, an uncomfortable one for a player who, despite his own Hall-worthy credentials, managed to force-feed the reputation he carried to OKC last summer, fair or not. \u2018Melo appeared selfish, worried about his role and his minutes and his contributions instead of conceding that, at least in this game, he was better off being a spectator. Until that point, Melo\u2019s benching wasn\u2019t a surprise. He\u2019d missed four out of his six shots and even worse was getting burned defensively: Joe Ingles and especially Jae Crowder buried OKC from deep. So, Melo was yanked in the third quarter and sat all but the final few minutes of the fourth, once the comeback was complete. The OKC locker room after Game 5 was a mixture of relief and enthusiasm. Relief from salvaging an embarrassing first half. And enthusiasm that was packed in suitcases and taken on their flight here for Game 6. Meanwhile, tucked in a corner of the room was Anthony, sitting silently as the locker room emptied, finally dressing and rising to his feet well over an hour after the buzzer. \u201cIt was just me wanting to play, me wanting to be a part of what was going on out there,\u201d he said of his argument with Cheeks. \u201cMy competitive nature just took over at that point, me wanting to be a part of that atmosphere and that game.\u201d Understand this about \u2018Melo: he has always been stand-up and accountable. That was true even in New York, where he never ducked tough questions that needed to be asked, even those about Phil Jackson. Even those about his own skills here at age 33. But what he says in public and what he says in the mirror could be two different versions of the truth. It\u2019s hard for All-Stars to accept the obvious, to concede erosion, to confront reality when they arrive at \u201cthat point\u201d in their career. And make no mistake, if this troublesome season in OKC is proving anything, it\u2019s that Anthony is no longer a lead singer in this league. He\u2019s a complimentary piece who sometimes delivers a flashback before settling into that euphemism that star players often sneer at: role player . He played just 25 minutes total in Game 5 , lifted for Alex Abrines (!) and Jerami Grant and was turned into a bench cheerleader who refused to cheer. That makes sense, to a degree; in this series leading up to Game 5, Anthony averaged 34 minutes a night. But: Anthony has been largely invisible and arguably a liability in those ample minutes. He\u2019s averaging just 12.8 points against the Jazz , and while that\u2019s not particularly shocking given the load carried by George and Westbrook, Anthony is shooting just 37 percent overall and 21 percent on 3-pointers. Once you consider the reasonable number of open looks he gets, those are blown scoring chances for the Thunder, which are costly against a stellar defensive team such as the Jazz. All this followed a regular season in which Anthony suffered sweeping career lows across the board . Donovan always maintained that of the three players, Anthony has dealt with the biggest adjustment. He\u2019s had to change his mindset, his looks at the basket, his position on the floor, his number of shots and his ego. For the first time in his basketball life, dating back to elementary school, Anthony isn\u2019t the primary option on his team \u2014 and, no, his one-month cameos on the star-stuffed US Olympic teams didn\u2019t prepare him for this. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Anthony\u2019s body language looked the most uncomfortable with this bold experiment, although he handled it well until Wednesday. He also didn\u2019t prepare his body for his 30s, unlike workout-room beasts LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and others. Some of this wasn\u2019t Melo\u2019s fault, like the knee surgeries. But is he lighter and leaner? Stronger? Fitter? The system used by Donovan isn\u2019t doing Anthony any favors, either. In his prime, Anthony was tough near the paint, which allowed him to stock up on free throws attempts nightly. This season he averaged 2.5 free throw attempts because he\u2019s mainly anchored near the 3-point line, where he stands and waits for kick-outs from Westbrook. With the Thunder down 3-2 and playing Friday on the road, there will be no appeasing Anthony. Donovan might choose to stick with a lineup of Westbrook, George, Grant, Abrines and Steven Adams during stretches if only because it gave Utah fits in Game 5. Most likely, Donovan will give Anthony a chance, at least early, to develop a flow and make himself dangerous to Utah. If that fails, Anthony said there won\u2019t be any repeat of his animated bench decorum. \u201cIf they have it going,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll understand.\u201d That\u2019s the proper approach and sometimes playoff matchups just aren\u2019t in your favor (just ask Hassan Whiteside). Anthony has an option year for $27.8 million next season. If he was in his 20s, he\u2019d opt-out to test the market and certainly would get a long-term, max deal from someone. But now? Players tend to know where they truly stand when it comes to money, and Anthony is no fool. He knows there\u2019s no free-agent jackpot awaiting him in July. In some ways, then, this first-round series is Anthony\u2019s last stand, and he can\u2019t do that while sitting. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Bickerstaff","content":" The Memphis Grizzlies have reportedly promoted interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff to be their next head coach, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . The agreement is said to be a three-year deal. After taking over coaching duties from David Fizdale, Bickerstaff went 15-48 as interim coach and, overall, the Grizzlies were 22-60 in 2017-18. That was Memphis\u2019 worst mark since a 24-win season in 2008-09 as it missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Memphis let Zach Randolph, Vince Carter and Tony Allen all leave as free agents in the summer of 2017 and signed Ben McLemore, Tyreke Evans and Mario Chalmers to retool the roster around All-Star center Marc Gasol and point guard Mike Conley and give Fizdale a faster lineup. The moves appeared to be working when Memphis started this season an NBA-best 5-1. The Grizzlies stood atop the Western Conference with a win over the Golden State Warriors and two over Southwest Division rival Houston. But the team lost 15 straight games from Nov. 11 to Dec. 4 to fall out of playoff contention and suffered through a 19-game losing streak that spanned from the end of January until mid-March. Additionally, the team learned in January that Conley needed heel surgery and would not return this season . He was limited to just 12 games this season, last playing on Nov. 13. Others, such as veteran Chandler Parsons, were in and out of the lineup with injuries as well. The rest of the playing rotation was comprised of young players and rookies. Last season marked Bickerstaff\u2019s second in his career as an interim coach. He joined the Grizzlies in June 2016 after five seasons with the Houston Rockets, including an interim coach stint that lasted most of 2015-16. Bickerstaff went 37-34 in that role, which included a playoff berth."},{"id":40765,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oklahoma-city-thunder-game-5-surge-russell-westbrook-paul-george","date":"2018-04-26","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder showcase superteam strength in epic Game 5 rally, win","content":"OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 A little more than halfway through Game 5 of this Western Conference first round series , obituaries were being written in basketball corners about the 2017-18 Oklahoma City Thunder, and surely they weren\u2019t glowing or sympathetic. Yes, perhaps a common passage about this franchise as it faced elimination was: Rest In Peace now, and after Paul George leaves this summer, Rest In Pieces. With 8 1\/2 minutes left in the third quarter against the plucky Utah Jazz, the Thunder were down 25 points and the usually supportive and polite Chesapeake Energy Arena crowd turned hostile. The boos were dropping almost as fast and as rare as the 3-pointers Jazz reserve forward Jae Crowder was nailing in the first half . And then, perhaps in some strange manner of telepathy, Thunder stars George and Russell Westbrook read those obits and muttered: To hell with that, we\u2019re not going out like this. Then, madness ensued, the script was flipped, OKC won 107-99 and the Jazz series lead was cut to 3-2. All of this came after the Thunder delivered their gutsiest \u2014 if not their best \u2014 second half of a very strange and at times frustrating season. \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t over right here,\u201d said George, speaking of the game, speaking of the season, speaking of his time in OKC (for now, anyway). \u201cWe\u2019ve been tested all season long.\u201d Shots fell, passes fell into the right hands and their own basketball was protected. It was a swift blizzard of OKC basketball that escalated and never slowed until the buzzer sounded. And there was nothing the Jazz did to prevent this series from being extended. The composure and pride of a superteam assembled last summer to contend for a title came together and in the nick of time, allowing the Thunder to save face and their basketball lives for at least another game. \u201cThis series has been about momentum changes,\u201d Westbrook said, \u201cand tonight was our turn.\u201d How did suspense suddenly creep into a series in which the Jazz controlled and held in their overachieving hands? First, Rudy Gobert got into foul trouble in the third quarter and the change was what you\u2019d expect. Westbrook and George refused to sit the entire second half as Westbrook scored 33 of his 45 points in that span and the duo led the fourth-largest playoff comeback in NBA playoff history. The game underlined how desperate Westbrook and George were to keep their season (and maybe their relationship as teammates) alive, while the Jazz once again showed how vulnerable they are defensively without their bedrock. When Gobert suffered a sprained knee in December, the Jazz floundered and were on course to miss the playoffs. Overall, that was a safe projection for a team that lost Gordon Hayward via free agency in the 2017 offseason. Once Gobert returned on Jan. 19, the Jazz went 32-9 \u2014 a mark that includes the first four games of this series. His presence in the middle allowed the Jazz to settle into a secure defensive mindset, knowing that Gobert was willing and able to protect the rim when teammates slipped up. That safety net disappeared with four minutes left in the third with Gobert got his fifth foul, and once he returned midway through the fourth quarter, OKC was already in control. In that span, Westbrook and George attacked the rim repeatedly and the rally sapped Utah\u2019s spirit. \u201cWe were having a hard time,\u201d said Donovan, \u201cand then Russell and Paul gave us life.\u201d The two OKC stars played off each other smoothly and effortlessly, taking turns on isolation plays, and combining on pick and rolls. It was the sort of fluid motion that went missing through chunks of an inconsistent regular season, which raised doubts about how compatible George, Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony would be in their first year together. It was no coincidence that OKC\u2019s rally happened with Anthony on the bench. He missed four of six shots, was invisible offensively and also had defensive issues. Donovan went with Alex Abrines over Anthony in the biggest game of the year, as if anyone needed further evidence of how far Anthony has fallen as an impact player. \u201cI thought we had a good rhythm and flow going, so went with that group,\u201d explained Donovan. George was good for 21 points in the second half, 34 for the game, and also played carefully through five fouls during most of the fourth quarter. It was George at his best: scoring, cleaning the glass (eight rebounds) and playing good enough defense that the Thunder finally kept Jazz rookie phenom Donovan Mitchell ( 23 points on nine-for-22 shooting ) from hurting them. \u201cA 25-point lead isn\u2019t safe in the NBA when you\u2019ve got two guys who do what they did,\u201d said Jazz coach Quin Snyder. As bravely as the Thunder battled back, there\u2019s the other side of the compliment: What was OKC doing getting bashed on its home floor to begin with? And why must OKC still fight off elimination for, at best, two more games this series, which now shifts to Salt Lake City? Game 5 was a small sample size of the Thunder\u2019s entire season, actually, filled with head-scratching stretches and also glimpses where they looked elite. Anthony, Westbrook and George are still, here in late April, trying to figure it out. That\u2019s always suspicious. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to fight all season long,\u201d said Westbrook. That becomes a drag, except the Thunder had no time to fix whatever was broken. The Jazz made sure of that, stealing one of the first two games in OKC and then taking the next two in Utah. Meanwhile, the Jazz saw an opportunity die Wednesday, and there\u2019s still a nagging question of whether Utah is a very good team, or merely a very hot team. This is for certain: Without Gobert, they\u2019re a very lost team defensively. \u201cIt shows,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cEven so, it\u2019s hard putting all of that pressure on him. We have to help the big fella out.\u201d Gobert felt guilty after Game 5 and acknowledged he should\u2019ve been smarter about filling up with fouls: \u201cThat\u2019s on me.\u201d Perhaps so. But this series is still on Westbrook, George and whatever\u2019s left of Anthony for OKC. They have big reputations to keep, a heavily-hyped season to save and quite possibly could lose George to free agency if they fizzle in the first round. And they must return to Salt Lake City on Friday ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), a place where they crumbled last weekend, and win just to have a chance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come back and do it again,\u201d said Donovan, \u201cand that\u2019s been this team\u2019s biggest challenge: The consistency.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Layup. Layup. Layup\u2026 LeBron James went at the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 Wednesday night like a boxer delivering body blows. Layup. Three-footer. Layup. Dunk. Layup\u2026 Through sheer brute force, James imposed his will again and again against Indiana\u2019s defense, bull-rushing the rim against or around single defenders, the other Pacers sticking close to shooters James might otherwise have found with passes. Layup. Finger roll. Layup. OK, an 18-footer. And then\u2026 James took the inbounds pass with three seconds left, dribbled quickly, then went up for his shot as he drifted right to left. He was 25 feet from the basket on a night when nearly everything he got came right at the rim. But sticking with the boxing analogy, it was as if all that pummeling to the gut got Indiana\u2019s head to drop. And that\u2019s when James delivered the knockout punch. The Cleveland star\u2019s 3-pointer at the buzzer lifted the Cavaliers to a 98-95 victory Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena and a 3-2 lead over the Pacers in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference series. James finished with 44 points on 14-of-24 shooting and an uncharacteristically flawless 15-of-15 from the line. It was a forceful, methodical assault on the Pacers\u2019 defense and, more generally, on their ambitions to survive and advance. James was relentless, a blunt instrument that often prompts the Michael Jordan supporters in GOAT debates to sneer at James\u2019 powerful substance over aeronautic style. His blocked shot-slash-uncalled-goaltend of Victor Oladipo\u2019s last-gasp layup on Indiana\u2019s final possession fit nicely in there, too, another nod to James being bigger and more physically dominating than most of his opponents. But the 3-pointer to win it? That was as skilled and artistic as anyone who\u2019s ever played the game, and it had James thinking some seriously old-school thoughts himself. \u201cBeing a kid, you always had those \u20183, 2, 1 moments,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it kind of felt like, like I was a kid all over again, playing basketball at my house with makeshift hoops and my socks as a basketball. And making that [crowd] noise.\u201d There was no simulating the reaction of the fans at the Q, though. The explosion of noise as James\u2019 shot swished through was as loud as anything the NBA has heard in years. His flair for the dramatic at both ends fended off the Pacers\u2019 earnest attempt to steal the outcome and saved Cleveland from a late-game stall (the Cavs\u2019 last field goal before James\u2019 game-winner came with 7:19 to play). There was a whole lot of basketball obscured or overshadowed by James\u2019 big stats and highlight moments, including Cleveland\u2019s cleaner, more straightforward defensive performance after halftime. Coach Tyronn Lue said he and his staff implored the Cavs to end a bad habit of third-quarter sags and got the response defensively they were seeking. For Indiana, Domantas Sabonis (22 points off the bench) and Thaddeus Young (16) picked up the slack when Oladipo had another cockeyed shooting night (2-for-15). And for all the analysis and breakdowns, with James\u2019 14-of-24 on one side of the ledger and Oladipo\u2019s shooting on the other, the result owed just as much to Cleveland\u2019s 26-of-27 free throw performance vs. Indiana\u2019s 21-of-27. Five games into the series, there is as much mutual respect between the Cavaliers and the Pacers as there is chafing. The Cleveland guys might not love Lance Stephenson\u2019s antics, but they appreciate how determined Indiana is \u2014 game by game and minute by minute \u2014 to play hard and not quit. The Indiana guys, meanwhile, are getting up-close, repeated black-and-blue contusions from James and looks at his squadron of deep threats. A decision to avoid getting hurt more by the likes of Kyle Korver, J.R. Smith, Kevin Love and others was what had Indiana taking its medicine over and over from James\u2019 rim runs. \u201cYou can run double teams at him to try to get the ball out of his hands,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \u201c[But] he\u2019s an excellent passer, he\u2019s a willing passer. With the shooters on the floor, he basically picks you apart when you play that type of defense. \u201cWhat he is doing because of spreading the floor, at times we\u2019re not in our gaps. He sees the paint as wide open. \u2026 If you collapse on the ball, he finds the 3-point shooters. What he was doing tonight was basically, he put his head down and attacked the basket.\u201d As for the buzzer-beater, McMillan mostly was annoyed that his team had both a timeout left and a foul to give, and used neither to disrupt Cleveland\u2019s rhythm with a mere three second remaining. \u201cWe had two things we could have used in that situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe leave here with both of \u2018em.\u201d James\u2019 performance Wednesday, on top of his 46-point effort in Game 2, has made it clear that the Cavaliers will go only as far as he can drag them. It\u2019s not the best model for success, James surrounded by an unproven, under-performing supporting cast. But as he reminded Indiana in Game 5, the Cavs have him and the Pacers do not, and that\u2019s plenty for a round or two. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Three wicked, lights-out quarters in five games is basically all it took for the Houston Rockets to handle their business in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs . The Minnesota Timberwolves could not have handled much more against the No. 1 overall seed in these playoffs. The 65-win Rockets team, the juggernaut that rolled over opponents for long stretches this season, could have easily ended this series in a sweep. But those Rockets have been missing in action for quite some time, according to coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. In his estimation, it\u2019s been a month or so since his team played the sort of inspired basketball that was their norm, the kind of basketball that chases away ghosts of postseasons past for D\u2019Antoni and Rockets\u2019 stars James Harden and Chris Paul . All three of them came into this season saddled with the added pressure of never reaching their zenith in the postseason. It\u2019s the one black mark on the otherwise stellar careers that they share. This postseason presented them with an opportunity to exorcise those demons, to wipe away the stain with some of the sustained excellence they showed off throughout the 2017-18 season. So when his team is up by 19 points and in complete control of a closeout game they were trailing by 10 just minutes earlier, D\u2019Antoni has every right to fuss and cuss in the timeout huddle. He also has every right to laugh and joke about it later, as he did after the Rockets finished off the Timberwolves 122-104 in Game 5 Wednesday night at Toyota Center. He\u2019ll take a 4-1 series victory every time, no matter how bad it might look to a perfectionist\u2019s eye getting there. \u201cWe\u2019re not good enough where we can just pick and choose quarters,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said through a tense smile. \u201cFirst of all, Minnesota never quit. They\u2019ve got a lot of talent \u2026 they\u2019re good. They made us work for everything. So we came up with three good quarters and knocked them out.\u201d D\u2019Antoni\u2019s right. And that won\u2019t work in the conference semifinals, where the Rockets will take on either the Utah Jazz or Oklahoma City Thunder, who head back to Salt Lake City for Friday\u2019s Game 6 in a series Utah leads 3-2 . It won\u2019t work in a meat-grinder of a postseason that has seen just one team on either side of the conference divide, the New Orleans Pelicans, sweep its first-round series. It won\u2019t work against the Pelicans or the reigning-champion Golden State Warriors, who will square off in the other Western Conference semifinal. Cruise control works when you have the Kia MVP frontrunner (Harden) playing at an otherworldly level, an all-time great point guard covering his back (Paul) with yet another All-Star caliber season and a supporting cast perfectly suited to thrive off the energy that duo produces. But not in the playoffs. Teams must take it up another notch or two with every you step out take deeper and deeper into the postseason pressure cooker. Harden knows as much, having struggled on the biggest stage before, The Finals in 2012 when he was with the Thunder . \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good step for us, a step in the right direction,\u201d Harden said. \u201cBut we still have a long way to go.\u201d It took the fifth and final game of the series for the Rockets to finally get back to some semblance of the team that ran roughshod through the league all season, and even then they only managed to do it for a half. They didn\u2019t duplicate the 50-point third quarter that carried them to a Game 4 win in Minnesota, the second-highest scoring quarter in NBA playoff history. But they got everything they needed outscoring the Timberwolves 30-15 in the third quarter of Game 5, reminding themselves and others that there are new levels this team can reach when it is properly locked on to the task at hand. They made a series-high 18 3-pointers and shot 51.1 percent after shooting 41.6 percent in Games 1-3. Harden and Paul had a combined seven points at halftime, but turned it up in that third quarter to jumpstart the comeback. Harden finished with 24 points and a game-high 12 assists and Paul with 12 and nine, both of them redeeming themselves after uncharacteristic first-half efforts. As good as they were in the end, it was that aforementioned supporting cast that shined brightest Wednesday. Clint Capela had a playoff career-high 26 points on 12-for-14 shooting to go along with 15 rebounds, completing his thorough domination of Timberwolves All-Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who struggled mightily in his postseason debut. \u201cI thought he was incredible,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said of Capela. \u201cHis thrust and force, his rebounding, what he did and the stamina. He played 33 minutes and there was no dip at all. He was incredible. You don\u2019t get much better than that. Now I know he plays the way that we play, but in that role he has, there\u2019s nobody better in the league.\u201d Veteran forwards Trevor Ariza (16 points, 4 3-pointers) and P.J. Tucker (playoff career-high 15 points after scoring 16 points combined in Games 1-4) got in on the fun, too, as did reigning Kia Sixth Man of the Year Eric Gordon (series-high 19 points). Ariza, the one player on the roster who owns a championship ring (Los Angeles Lakers, 2009) acknowledged the importance of handling the business at hand. He knows that the road ahead is more grueling than what the Rockets experienced against the Timberwolves. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, it will give us time to rest and give us time to work on things that we didn\u2019t do so well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that we got it over with, it\u2019s an encouraging thing.\u201d Given what lies ahead for any team with championship ambitions, but especially these Rockets, a little time to reflect and refocus before the next challenge might be exactly what\u2019s needed. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Cavs\u2019 out-of-bounds play snagged Thaddeus Young on an off-ball screen, giving James the breathing room he needed for the catch, two dribbles, and a clean look while drifting to his left. He could have been more tightly defended, but the shot was far from easy. GAME SITUATION: The series was tied 2-2 entering Wednesday night, and the Cavs appeared in serious danger of heading back to Indianapolis one game away from elimination. The Cavaliers\u2019 franchise and its star player were very close to confronting difficult offseason questions about what\u2019s next for each of them. Instead, both parties get to bask in another timeless playoff moment and keep their postseason hopes alive. CELEBRATION: For a 15-year veteran, James sure knows how to enjoy the moment. The 33-year-old backpedaled after shooting it, raised his arms when it went in, then turned and gave a sky-high body-bump to the first teammate to greet him. It didn\u2019t stop there, either. James jumped on top of the scorer\u2019s table and incited his fans to greater celebrations. Then his teammates doused him with a bevy of icy drinks in the middle of a national television interview. Safe to say Cleveland and the state of Ohio loves their home-grown hero. GRADE: Playoffs. National television. Series tied. The best player of his generation.

The independent commission, led by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, released a detailed 60-page report Wednesday , seven months after the group was formed by the NCAA in response to a federal corruption investigation that rocked college basketball. Ten people, including some assistant coaches, have been charged in a bribery and kickback scheme, and high-profile programs such as Arizona, Louisville and Kansas have been tied to possible NCAA violations. \u201cThe members of this commission come from a wide variety of backgrounds but the one thing that they share in common is that they believe the college basketball enterprise is worth saving,\u201d Rice told the AP Tuesday night, before addressing NCAA leaders on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe believe there\u2019s a lot of work to do in that regard. That the state of the game is not very strong. \u201cWe had to be bold in our recommendations.\u201d The Associated Press obtained a copy of the report ahead of Rice presenting its findings to top NCAA officials. It\u2019s not yet clear how the governing body would pay for some of the proposals, and some of the panel\u2019s key recommendations would require cooperation from the NBA, its players union and USA Basketball. Among the topics the commission emphasized was the need for elite players to have more options when choosing between college and professional basketball, and to separate the two tracks. The commission called for the NBA and its players association to change rules requiring players to be at least 19 years old and a year removed from graduating high school to be draft eligible. The one-and-done rule was implemented in 2006, despite the success of straight-from-high-school stars such as LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett. \u201cI\u2019m confident they are going to be very supportive,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said of the NBA and NBAPA. National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts and NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement Wednesday in response: \u201cThe NBA and the NBPA thank Secretary Rice and the members of the Commission on College Basketball for their commitment to address the issues facing men\u2019s college basketball. We support NCAA policy and enforcement reforms that will better safeguard the well-being of players while imposing greater accountability on representatives and programs that fail to uphold the values of the game. We also share the Commission\u2019s concern with the current state of youth basketball and echo that all stakeholders \u2014 including the NBA, NBPA, NCAA, and USA Basketball \u2014 have a collective responsibility to help bring about positive change. Regarding the NBA\u2019s draft eligibility rules, the NBA and NBPA will continue to assess them in order to promote the best interests of players and the game.\u201d The commission did, however, say if the NBA and NBPA refuse to change their rules in time for the next basketball season, it would reconvene and consider other options for the NCAA, such as making freshmen ineligible or locking a scholarship for three or four years if the recipient leaves a program after a single year. \u201cOne-and-done has to go one way or another,\u201d Rice told the AP, expressing hope the NBA would act. The commission decided against attempting to mirror rules for baseball but said it could reconsider. Major League Baseball drafts players out of high school, but once an athlete goes to college he is not eligible to be drafted until after his third year. Baseball players can also return for their senior seasons after being drafted as long as they do not sign professional contracts. The commission did take a piece of the baseball model and recommended basketball players be allowed to test the professional market in high school or after any college season, while still maintaining college eligibility. If undrafted, a college player would remain eligible as long as he requests an evaluation from the NBA and returns to the same school. Players could still leave college for professional careers after one year, but the rules would not compel them to do so. The commission offered harsh assessments of toothless NCAA enforcement, as well as the shady summer basketball circuit that includes AAU leagues and brings together agents, apparel companies and coaches looking to profit on teenage prodigies. It called the environment surrounding college basketball \u201ca toxic mix of perverse incentives to cheat,\u201d and said responsibility for the current mess goes all the way up to university presidents. The group recommended the NCAA have more involvement with players before they get to college and less involvement with enforcement. It also acknowledged the NCAA will need help to make some changes and defended its amateurism model, saying paying players a salary isn\u2019t the answer. \u201cThe goal should not be to turn college basketball into another professional league,\u201d the commission wrote in its report. Rice presented the commission\u2019s report to the NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors and Division I Board of Directors at the association\u2019s headquarters Wednesday. She called the crisis in college basketball \u201cfirst and foremost a problem of failed accountability and lax responsibility.\u201d The two groups of university presidents planned to meet after Rice\u2019s presentation to consider adopting the commission\u2019s recommendations. If adopted, the hard work of turning the recommendations into NCAA legislation begins. Emmert has said he wants reforms in place by August. The commission does, too. And it wants to review the NCAA\u2019s plans for implementation before it goes before the boards for approval. The 12-member commission made up of college administrators and former coaches and players was tasked with finding ways to reform five areas: NBA draft rules, including the league\u2019s age limit that has led to so-called one-and-done players; the relationship between players and agents; non-scholastic basketball, such as AAU, meant to raise the profile of recruits; involvement of apparel companies with players, coaches and schools; and NCAA enforcement. NCAA officials mostly stayed out of the process. Emmert and Georgia Tech President Bud Peterson were part of the commission, but not included in executive sessions, when proposals were being formed. The commission spent 70 percent of its time in executive session, Rice said, and kept its work secret until Wednesday\u2019s reveal. The overarching message to those in college athletics: Take responsibility for problems you have created. The commission recommended harsher penalties for rule-breakers and that the NCAA outsource the investigation and adjudication of the most serious infractions cases. Level I violations would be punishable with up to a five-year postseason ban and the forfeiture of all postseason revenue for the time of the ban. That could be worth tens of millions to major conference schools. By comparison, recent Level I infractions cases involving Louisville and Syracuse basketball resulted in postseason bans of one year. In those cases, then-Louisville coach Rick Pitino, who was later fired after being tied to the FBI investigation, received a five-game NCAA suspension for violations related to an assistant coach hiring strippers for recruits, and Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim was suspended for nine games for academic misconduct and extra benefits violations. The commission said suspensions should be longer, up to one full season. Instead of show cause orders, which are meant to limit a coach\u2019s ability to work in college sports after breaking NCAA rules, the report called for lifetime bans. The commission also said coaches and administrators should be contractually obligated comply with NCAA investigations. With agent conduct part of the federal corruption investigation into college basketball, the commission charged with finding reforms wants the NCAA to actively monitor agents and provide regulated ways for them to advise athletes on their professional prospects. The Commission on College Basketball proposed Wednesday that the NCAA develop \u201cstrict standards\u201d for certifying agents, who would be allowed to interact with players as early as high school as long as they followed rules prohibiting them from providing improper benefits or entering into representation deals with the athletes. The NCAA would appoint a vice presidential position to develop and administer the certification program, which would be limited to certain periods of the year. \u201cThe NCAA should bring these conversations into the light and allow elite players to discuss their prospects with (certified agents),\u201d the report said. \u201cThis would provide a channel through which information about a player\u2019s professional prospects and value could flow.\u201d The NCAA, with support from the NBA and USA Basketball, should run its own recruiting events for prospects during the summer, the commission said, and take a more serious approach to certifying events it does not control. The NCAA should require greater transparency of the finances of what it called non-scholastic basketball events and ban its coaches from attending those that do not comply with more stringent vetting, the report said. Such a ban could wipe out AAU events that have flourished in showcasing future talent. The commission also called for greater financial transparency from shoe and apparel companies such as Nike, Under Armour and Adidas. These companies have extensive financial relationships with colleges and coaches worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and Adidas had two former executives charged by federal prosecutors in New York in the corruption case. The commission also called out university presidents, saying administrators can\u2019t be allowed to turn a blind eye to infractions. To that end, the commission said university presidents should be required to \u201ccertify annually that they have conducted due diligence and that their athletic programs comply with NCAA rules.\u201d The commission recommended the NCAA Board of Governors, currently comprised of 16 university presidents and chancellors, include five public members with full voting privileges who are not currently employed as university leaders. Finally, the commission admonished those within college sports who use the NCAA as a scapegoat for the problems in basketball, saying universities and individuals are accountable for keeping the game clean. \u201cWhen those institutions and those responsible for leading them short-circuit rules, ethics and norms in order to achieve on-court success, they alone are responsible,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cToo often, these individuals hide behind the NCAA when they are the ones most responsible for the degraded state of intercollegiate athletics, in general, and college basketball in particular.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report"},{"id":47063,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-should-be-next-coach-new-york-knicks","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Blogtable: Who should be next coach of New York Knicks?","content":" * * * The next coach of the New York Knicks should be _______________.  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Doc Rivers? Rivers might or might not be available for the gig, but he\u2019s got the resume and \u2013 more important \u2013 the outsize personality for it. Even when the team is bad, the media attention is such that a lower-wattage fellow like Jeff Hornacek really never had a chance. Rivers played in New York, he knows what the market requires and he\u2019s got enough of a salesman and schmoozer in him to keep the critics at bay while he brings the basketball along. The only question is, does he have the desire at this stage of his career to climb the rather steep Knicks mountain? Shaun Powell :  Mike Woodson is the choice. He had a good run in his previous Knicks stint and never should\u2019ve been fired anyway. He\u2019s not the popular choice (Mark Jackson) or the basketball insider choice (Jerry Steakhouse) but he\u2019s the safe selection. Anyway, hiring the right coach is the least of the Knicks\u2019 problems but that\u2019s a blogtable question for another day. John Schuhmann :  Someone with patience and player development skills. With Kristaps Porzingis\u2019 development on hold, the Knicks should have a 3-5 year plan, build organically, and focus on the development Frank Ntilikina and their 2018 Lottery pick. Heck, once he returns, Porzingis will still have a lot of work to do to become a complete player. Ntilikina has already been able to make an impact defensively and can special if his offense develops. The Knicks only have to look 80 miles south to find an example of a coach (Brett Brown) who was the perfect fit for a slow rebuild and who established a strong foundation (in regard to player development and style of play) before the talent eventually arrived. Sekou Smith :  Mark Jackson makes all sorts of obvious sense to me. He\u2019s a New Yorker, a former fan-favorite as a player, he understands the Knicks\u2019 predicament and was a culture-changer and talent \u2014 developer in Golden State. Which means he probably won\u2019t be the guy. But for all of the same reasons that I love Jackson in that role with the Knicks, I love David Fizdale for the job as well . The Knicks don\u2019t have a team on the cusp of making the playoffs or anything, so there\u2019s no need for some quick-fix approach in their coaching search. They need someone who\u2019s going to come in and dig into the players under contract and help them improve. They need a coach whose aspirations are not focused on being the general manager, someone locked in on the ugly part of \u201cThe Process\u201d (to borrow a phrase from the folks down the road in Philadelphia). Fizdale deserves better than what he got in Memphis. This is the right place for him to continue what he started with the Grizzlies. * * *"},{"id":47101,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lasting-memories-manu-ginobili-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Blogtable: What is your one, lasting memory of Manu Ginobili?","content":" * * * If this is the end for Manu Ginobili , what is your one, lasting memory of the Argentine superstar?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  There\u2019s no single shot or playoff moment for me. Instead, it\u2019s simply the way in which Ginobili has aged gracefully before our eyes , from rambunctious import to San Antonio Spurs elder statesman. At this late date, he retains the ability to turn playoff games with a clutch bucket, a steal or a charge taken. But he also has been a class act, stellar teammate, willing role player and a glaring oversight by those of us in the Pro Basketball Writers Association who never got him enough votes to win our Magic Johnson Award, presented annually to the great player who is great with the media. I voted for him again this year but, just in case, I\u2019ve got to honor his worthiness here. Shaun Powell :  There are plenty of Ginobili highlights in the NBA, but the basketball memory for me is came in Athens at the 2004 Olympics , when he set the tone for Argentina with a buzzer-beater against Serbia and helped his country win gold. It was good to see Manu among his own, getting lots of love and being in his element. He became a national hero then and essentially punched his ticket to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame someday. John Schuhmann :  Being in the building for his final game with the national team at the Olympics in Rio two years ago. There\u2019s a connection that international fans have with their athletes that we don\u2019t have in the United States, and it\u2019s always special to witness that first hand. Basketball isn\u2019t the No. 1 sport in Argentina, but Argentines have a tremendous pride that one of their own, in addition to having led unprecedented success with the national team, became of the best and most decorated players in basketball history. As an Argentine-American, it was special for me to be in that building for what was an emotional moment for Ginobili and his countrymen.  Sekou Smith :  Wow. The end of the road for Manu, huh? It is a reality. After all these years, all the wins and spectacular moments with both the Spurs and Argentina, it\u2019s hard to pick just one lasting memory. But I\u2019ll go with The 2005 Finals , when Manu was on fire in a great series against a Detroit Pistons team trying to win back-to-back titles. He helped those Spurs topple the Pistons in one of the best seven-game Finals we\u2019ve seen. Tim Duncan was the Finals MVP, and deservedly so, but it could have just as easily been Ginobili. Manu\u2019s style and unorthodox ballet on the court always served as a reminder to me how those who perform at the highest level \u2014 the truly special ones, like Ginobili \u2014 are true artists on the court. * * *"},{"id":46896,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-new-orleans-pelicans-demarcus-cousins-contract-future","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Blogtable: Should New Orleans Pelicans break the bank to re-sign DeMarcus Cousins?","content":" * * * Should the Pelicans break the bank for free agent DeMarcus Cousins this summer, or let him walk away?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Let him walk.

Few teams have the money under the cap (not counting the rebuilding teams like the Orlando Magic, who probably wouldn\u2019t want him) to break the bank for him, and of those teams, it\u2019s fair to say some wouldn\u2019t want him because of his injury and\/or a perceived bad fit in today\u2019s system. If another team is willing to give him the four-year max, I shake his hand and let him walk. Something in the range of three years and $60 million sounds reasonable and safe for New Orleans. John Schuhmann :  It would be nice to somehow thread the needle and do neither, but if those are the only two options, letting him walk away is the better one. We don\u2019t know how well or how quickly Cousins will recover from his Achilles injury, and the Pelicans have obviously found a successful formula without him, playing faster, spacing the floor, and playing top-five defense around Anthony Davis (mostly playing center). Davis has taken his game to a new level in the last three months and maybe he can apply that to a reunion with Cousins, but it would be preferable find more complementary pieces and not let a new Cousins contract kill whatever flexibility the Pelicans have going forward.  Sekou Smith :  There is no way you let Cousins walk away after giving up all of the assets the Pelicans did to get him. This dilemma requires a rather simple solution, as far as I can tell. The Pelicans should come up with an incentive-laden deal for Cousins that makes it clear if he\u2019s comes back as good as ever from his Achilles injury, he\u2019ll be able to earn every penny he would have gotten if he\u2019d never suffered that injury. The Pelicans don\u2019t have to break any banks that they weren\u2019t going to anyway to keep Cousins in the fold with Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. I know the way the Pelicans have performed in Cousins\u2019 absence might have changed some opinions about his value and whether or not he\u2019s critical to the franchise\u2019s long-term future and success. But not here. I think they are perennial playoff outfit with him in the fold, provided of course, he\u2019s able to come back from that Achilles injury."},{"id":46829,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/future-san-antonio-spurs-roster-kawhi-leonard-pau-gasol-manu-ginobili-tony","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Offseason of change could be afoot for San Antonio Spurs","content":" For the first time since 1996-97, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 season has ended before April 24. What lies in store for the team is anyone\u2019s guess, but a markedly different roster may be among the things to watch for come the 2018-19 season. Last night\u2019s 99-91 loss to the Golden State Warriors in Game 5 of the first round sets in motion a summer for the Spurs that may feature several well-known players coming back \u2014 or moving on. After the loss, Spurs fan-favorite and former All-Star Manu Ginobili was at the point he was after last season\u2019s loss in the West finals to the Warriors: deciding what to do about his future . The swingman is under contract for 2018-19, but he said Tuesday night he is weighing what\u2019s next in his career. \u201cAs I\u2019ve done it the last two or three seasons, I\u2019ll sit back, relax and, after two or three months, see if I feel retired or not,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cI like to let it season a little bit, to see how I feel. Don\u2019t expect news until July, probably. I just don\u2019t know. I let a month, two months go by and see how I feel. I\u2019m not the type of guy who makes decisions on the fly, and when you are upset, hurt or whatever.\u201d * Powell:  Reflecting on Ginobili\u2019s remarkable career While the Spurs await Ginobili\u2019s next move, one thing high on the list of priorities for the team is a meeting with injured All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard, writes ESPN\u2019s Michael Wright and the San Antonio Express-News \u2018 Jabari Young: Via Twitter, Young reports the following regarding Leonard : Leonard missed all but nine games this season while nursing right quadriceps tendinopathy, an injury that flared up late in the offseason. He returned to the team\u2019s lineup briefly but did not come back again after complaining of soreness in his injured thigh following the Spurs\u2019 home win over Denver on Jan. 13. Popovich himself has endured plenty of late, as he has been grieving the death of his wife, Erin, who died last week after a prolonged illness . He did not coach in Games 3, 4 or 5 ( Spurs assistant coach Ettore Messina handled those duties ). Popovich has coached the team since 1997-98 and is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA. He will also be coaching Team USA before the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Then there is point guard Tony Parker, who is a free agent this summer. He said last summer he hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would require the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray this season and remains open to returning to San Antonio. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Parker told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI said already I want to keep playing. I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t have those retirement parties. I want to keep playing, and we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s in San Antonio. Everybody knows I would love to stay here. But free agency is always crazy, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d Other players, such as Green and veteran swingman Rudy Gay, face contract decisions this summer, writes Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News : Things seem a little more certain in the Spurs\u2019 frontcourt, where All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge is under contract for three more seasons and is fresh off a standout 2017-18 campaign . Additionally, big man Pau Gasol \u2014 who is under contract for two more seasons \u2014 made it clear he plans to keep playing, too. \u201cI have plenty of gas in the tank,\u201d Gasol told reporters after Game 5. \u201cI feel like I can do a lot of good things on the floor and play three years, three, four years. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind. But, knowing that, I also take it one year at a time. I go step by step and try not to look too much into the future because a lot of factors come into play. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had a pretty good season \u2026 very efficient for minutes and opportunities that I\u2019ve been given. Obviously I would like to produce more and have the chance to get on the floor a little bit more so I can be the player that I am, that I have been throughout my career and that I still can be.\u201d All told, it seems like an offseason like no other awaits the Spurs. * * *"},{"id":47072,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-heat-dwyane-wade-no-decision-future-game-5-loss-philadelphia-76ers","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade mum for now on future plans, retirement talk","content":" The Miami Heat\u2019s playoff run came to an end on Tuesday night in a 104-91 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 . While there was much celebration for the Sixers, the Heat are left to ponder their season and the summer that looms ahead. A key part of the Heat\u2019s offseason and their next moves will be shaped by Dwyane Wade\u2019s decision, too. The veteran guard wrapped up his 15th season in the NBA and, after Game 5, was not saying much about whether or not he will play a 16th season come 2018-19. \u201cThat\u2019s not my focus,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday . \u201cFresh off this NBA season, my 15th year, I sit back and think about that. Then I dive and throw myself into my family. They\u2019re next on my bucket list, making sure I\u2019m there for them. And when it comes to the basketball side of it, which is a long time away from now, then I\u2019ll think about that.\u201d \u201cI love Philly, but ain\u2019t gonna be no breaking news here in Philly. I\u2019m sorry. I appreciate [the concern], but let me worry about that later.\u201d Wade once again was in a reserve role in Game 5, logging 11 points (on 4-for-15 shooting), five rebounds and five assists in 30 minutes. It was the 177th playoff game in Wade\u2019s career, which ranks 19th all-time in NBA history. In an interview with Miami Heat team broadcaster Eric Reed after Game 5 , Wade was also not saying much about what he plans to do next. Reed: \u201cI remember visiting with you in the Cleveland locker room earlier this season and you said, for the first time in your life, you weren\u2019t sure about next season. I know you\u2019re not going to make any decisions now, but, what thoughts do you have about your future?\u201d Wade: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I said that at that time because it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know going into the summer of my 15th year, turning 37 next year, there\u2019s a lot of variables that go into it. You sit down and you make the best decision for you and your family.\u201d Additionally, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra wasn\u2019t in much of a mood to address the topic, either, after Game 5. \u201dYou\u2019re going to make me emotional if we start to think about that or talk about that right now,\u201d Spoelstra said. Wade\u2019s wife, Gabrielle Union, took to social media to address the topic of her husband\u2019s future. On Twitter, she posted : When Dwyane Wade left the Miami Heat for the Chicago Bulls as a free agent back in the summer of 2016 , the lines of communication between Wade and the front office were fractured . Yet even in leaving South Florida, Wade always felt a kinship to the franchise and said in 2016 \u201cI\u2019ll always be a Heat.\u201d The Heat reacquired Wade at the trade deadline this season as the Cleveland Cavaliers underwent a midseason roster overhaul . Shortly after his return to the Heat, Wade told ESPN he wanted to be with the team \u2018forever\u2019 and did not want a farewell tour whenever he does decide to retire. Wade won three championships with the Heat (2006, \u201912, \u201913) and was named Finals MVP in 2006. He has played 876 games for Miami, and is the team\u2019s all-time leader in points (20,473), assists (5,009), steals (1,433), field goals made (7,426) and attempted (15,267) and free throws made (5,226) and attempted (6,815). Additionally, he is second only to Hall of Famer Alonzo Mourning in blocked shots (774) in Heat history. To Wade, a chance to return to Miami and play with the Heat again made this season standout. \u201cIt meant a lot. I was very thankful to the guys here that accepted me with open arms the way that they did,\u201d Wade told Reed after Game 5. \u201cI was only here for 20 games \u2014 plus the playoffs \u2014 but it felt like I was here longer. I feel like I know those guys and it\u2019s like family. I was glad I could come back and be a part of this.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * *"},{"id":47018,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-pelicans-west-semifinals-series-preview","date":"2018-04-25","title":"Series preview: Appropriate fear, ultimate confidence surround Golden State Warriors","content":"Appropriate fear. That \u2019 s the term, adopted from San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, that Steve Kerr likes to use about his team \u2019 s approach this time of year. He prefers the Golden State Warriors operate with a supply large enough to last well into June, even if we all know it isn \u2019 t always needed before then. But if you \u2019 ve seen the same things out of the New Orleans Pelicans that Kerr and his staff surely did in their first-round sweep of the No. 3 seed Portland Trail Blazers, an appropriate amount of fear is more than appropriate as the Warriors prepare to deal with the Pelicans in the Western Conference semifinals sans two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry, whose availability for this series remains a mystery. The Warriors have never seemed more vulnerable, if you believe the hype. And the Pelicans have never been better or more dangerous. In Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, the Pelicans have talents capable of matching their Warriors counterparts step for step. And as long as Rajon Rondo is locked in as \u201c Playoff Rondo \u201d (the catalyst for six straight playoff wins dating back to last postseason in Chicago), the Warriors \u2019 edge in seasoning isn \u2019 t nearly as dramatic in the flesh as it appears on paper. Davis and Holiday put on an absolute show in their close-out win over the Trail Blazers, combining for 88 points to tie Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek and Jo Jo White for the most points by two teammates in any playoff game in NBA history. And they became just the third pair of teammates to score 40 or more points on 60 percent shooting in the same playoff game. Jalen Rose and Reggie Miller (2000) and Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler are the others. Rose and Miller played for a championship that season with the Indiana Pacers while Olajuwon and Drexler won a championship that season with the Houston Rockets. The Pelicans \u2019 complete disruption of the Trail Blazers \u2019 plans on both ends contributed mightily to their dismantling of Damian Lillard, C.J. McCollum and Co. And Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry didn \u2019 t have the familiarity with Portland \u2019 s DNA the way he does with the Warriors. Remember, it was Gentry who coordinated offense for the Warriors during their breakthrough championship season in 2015, before relocating to New Orleans to resurrect the Pelicans. The giant wrinkle in that entire theory, however, is Kevin Durant. This is just his second season with the Warriors. And like everyone else in basketball, Gentry is fully aware of the difference a superstar like Durant makes for a Warriors team that was championship ready before his arrival. Even without Curry in the lineup, Popovich \u2019 s Spurs had no answers for Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, the trio making up the healthy third of the Warriors \u2019 All-Star quartet. Scoring points for the Warriors is rarely an issue with all of the firepower on the roster. Their defensive prowess, however, remains a focus in the postseason. And they are confident in their work on that end after finding a good vibe against the Spurs, leading all playoff teams in defensive field goal percentage in the first round. You don \u2019 t win at the rate the Warriors have the past four seasons without being ultra confident in what you can do, regardless of the opponent. Appropriate fear and ultra confidence will both be on display in this Western Conference semifinal.  1. Who is the best player in this series, Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis, and will that make a difference in the final outcome? It \u2019 s Durant, given both his accomplishments and playoff experience, but it \u2019 s extremely close. These are are two of the top three or four players in the game. And yes, it will make a difference in the end. It always does. Just go back and examine the play of the two best players The Finals last year. LeBron James was a monster for the Cleveland Cavaliers. But Durant outplayed him, winning Finals MVP honors and leading the Warriors to the title. As great as Davis was this season and particularly during the first round sweep of Portland, it \u2019 s hard to argue with Durant \u2019 s track record and championship results.  2. Will there be a Stephen Curry sighting in this series if to goes six or seven games? Potentially, yes, if it lasts that long. And there is no reason to believe this will be a repeat of the Warriors \u2019 sweep of the Davis-led Pelicans from 2015. Curry is in the non-contact, on-court workout portion of his rehabilitation on his knee and will be reevaluated Friday. But Kerr insists that he is nowhere near ready to play. And given his importance to the Warriors long-term, there will be no rushing the process for Curry. Still, there is no doubt things change dramatically, for both teams, with Steph in uniform and on the court. The Warriors are so much more dynamic with him and in turn a much bigger headache to deal with for the opposition. 3. Is the Jrue Holiday who destroyed the Trail Blazers the real Jrue Holiday? And what does that mean for the Warriors? Do your homework on Holiday and you \u2019 ll find out that he was the top rated player in the nation as a high school senior and an All-Star in Philadelphia before being traded to New Orleans. And this is the first time he \u2019 s been injury and stress free. He \u2019 s arguably the most underappreciated two-way player in the league and is the league \u2019 s premier defender at his position, just ask his coach. He \u2019 s a big, physical guard capable of playing on or off the ball who can guard three positions on the defensive end. Is he really a 27.8-point (on 57 percent shooting from the floor), 6.5-assist, 4.0-rebound dynamo we saw shut down Damian Lillard in that sweep of the Trail Blazers? Maybe not \u2026 or maybe he is. His match up against Klay Thompson will be critical to the Pelicans \u2019 chances in this series. 114.7 \u2014 The Pelicans have had the No. 1 offense in the postseason , having scored 114.7 points per 100 possessions in their first-round sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers. That was more than 10 points per 100 possessions more than the Blazers\u2019 eighth-ranked defense allowed in the regular season. They shot well (40 percent) from 3-point range, but also did damage inside. In fact, Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday lead the postseason with 15.5 and 14.5 points per game in the restricted area , respectively, with Holiday\u2019s scoring at the rim seeing a huge jump from the regular season, when he averaged just 6.8 points per game in the restricted area . The Warriors protected the rim well in their first round series, allowing the San Antonio Spurs to take only 24 percent of their shots in the restricted area, down from 29 percent in the regular season . No team has seen a bigger drop. \u2014 John Schuhmann The Pelicans were the hottest team in the league in the first round, the only team to sweep. They \u2019 ve got the requisite firepower to go toe-to-toe with the Warriors and the perfect foil for a competitive engagement of this magnitude in Rajon Rondo. But the Warriors are a different beast compared to the Trail Blazers. They \u2019 ve got elite firepower and size that the Portland simply did not. And if they get their two-time Kia MVP back sooner rather than later, they \u2019 ll have a wild card no other team in the league will have in this postseason. A feisty, tightly contested series? Sure. But another upset? Not exactly. Warriors in 6. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Process started in 2012 and head coach Brett Brown laid down the foundation right away. The commitment to player development and a certain style of play has been there from Day 1. The draft picks piled up and the young talent eventually got healthy. The Sixers took a big jump last season with Joel Embiid playing just 31 games and an even bigger jump this season with a healthy Embiid and a Rookie of the Year campaign from Ben Simmons. But what we\u2019ve seen in the last two and 1\/2 months is remarkable. This team has quickly gone from average to the most complete team in the Eastern Conference. On Feb. 6, the Sixers were 25-25 and in eighth place in the East. They ranked fourth in the league in defensive efficiency and fifth in the conference in point differential, but were .500 because they weren\u2019t great in close games. In fact, they were the worst fourth-quarter team in the league by a pretty wide margin and had lost six of the 23 games they had led by at least 15 points. They were great early in games, but couldn\u2019t close. Eleven weeks later, the Sixers have closed out their first-round series with the Miami Heat on their first try, grinding through an ugly first 24 minutes and putting the Heat away with a 58-45 second half to earn a 104-91, Game 5 victory and a trip to the conference semifinals, where they will meet the Boston Celtics or the Milwaukee Bucks. We knew that the Sixers had the talent to win a playoff series. Simmons and Embiid are transcendent players. \u201cThis is the future of the NBA,\u201d Dwyane Wade said. We knew they had the size to win a playoff series. J.J. Redick is their only starter under 6-foot-9. The Sixers have an elite defense and they have an offense that is tough to guard. They just never stop moving. The question was how they\u2019d deal with the pressure of finishing off a resilient opponent. Before Game 5, Brown wasn\u2019t concerned with Xs and Os. He wanted to see how his team handled the opportunity to close out the series. \u201cThere is a discipline, a maturity that we need to have that might contradict some of their resumes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need that. That\u2019s what you need in a close-out game. That overarching notion is what interests me more than the minutia of little details with offense or defense.\u201d Brown got what he wanted. The game wasn\u2019t pretty; The Sixers shot 5-for-26 from outside the restricted area in the first half and made just seven threes (on 28 or more attempts) for the third time in the last four games. But they defended well and were at their best in the second half, because they have learned how to close. \u201cYou have high-level talent with [Simmons and Embiid],\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cTheir poise, to be able to tap into that talent, belies their years. That\u2019s impressive to be able to do that in a playoff setting.\u201d Over the course of the five-game series, the Sixers outscored the Heat by 37 points in the third quarter and by 41 in the fourth. That problem with closing games is long gone. The Sixers have won 20 of their last 21 games. They\u2019ve been dominant at home since Jan. 1, but they also won the first two road playoff games that four of their five starters have ever played in. They came back from 17 points down in the second half of Game 4 in Miami. This team has come a long way in the last 11 weeks, further than any of them could have imagined. \u201cIt\u2019s caught us off guard,\u201d Brown admitted. \u201cThere is no doubt about that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve changed our goals now,\u201d J.J. Redick added, \u201clike, four times.\u201d At first, they just wanted to make the playoffs. Then they wanted to win 50 games and get home-court advantage in the first round. Then they wanted the 3 seed. Now? Who knows. This team is really good on both ends of the floor, and this growth spurt might not be over, because the Sixers have had Embiid back for just three games, he\u2019s still getting used to the mask he\u2019s wearing to protect his face, and his offense hasn\u2019t quite returned to form. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s no team that has more chance for upside than we do,\u201d Brown said, \u201cbecause of the youth, because we haven\u2019t had Joel for three weeks. \u201cThe longer we survive, the longer we can stay in this, I see an upside here that we can go to a higher level of play. And I get really excited about that.\u201d They\u2019ve reached all those goals they set out for themselves and there\u2019s more to come. They\u2019re the first Eastern Conference team to win its playoff series, and no team in either conference has played better over the last month. The Sixers aren\u2019t just the future of the NBA. They\u2019re the present. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any sense of complacency,\u201d Redick said. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied. This group is still hungry. We want more.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Victor Oladipo, who has spent the past seven months making the Thunder look bad for trading him away \u2013 along with big man Domantas Sabonis \u2013 in the Paul George deal, had a nightmarish shooting night (5-of-20) at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That was one of several Pacers failings that thwarted their chance to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and push LeBron James and the rest of the Cavaliers to the brink of elimination. Oladipo, motivated by the trade and the trash talked nationally about the Pacers\u2019 end of the deal, worked himself all the way to the All-Star Game this season. He\u2019ll likely have the Most Improved Player award on his mantle when the league\u2019s hardware is handed out in a couple months. But it\u2019s hard to imagine he or his Pacers teammates will have a series victory. Not now. Not after the way they let James and Co. off the hook Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m a person that learns,\u201d Oladipo said, when asked about his ways of coping with a forgettable offensive performance. He shot 3-of-7 in the first half when Indiana fell behind by 10 points, then missed his first 10 shots of the second half. His last one, a 3-pointer late, mattered not at all in the 104-100 defeat . \u201cI learn from it. I make sure I\u2019m better the next game.\u201d What he and the Pacers learned the hard way is this: If you come at the King, you best not miss. With all the reason in the world to play their best game so far in the series \u2013 and maybe because of that imperative, turned over a few too many times in their heads until it loomed as pressure \u2013 the Pacers didn\u2019t come close. They had trouble getting out of their own way in the first half. Determined to clean up bad starts in the two previous games, they instead made it three in a row \u2013 this makes it 33, 31 and 30 points allowed in the first quarters alone. Indiana dug itself a hole again double-digits deep by intermission, and didn\u2019t fully make the Cavs pay when they fell prey to their own bad habit of shaky third quarters. The Pacers appeared to have the defending East champions right where they wanted them midway through the fourth after James was whistled for a technical foul (he shoved pest Lance Stephenson to the floor in a move that had to be worth a point to him). That free throw put Indiana up 92-89 \u2026 after which it unraveled completely. The Pacers missed their next three shots, two by Oladipo and one by Cory Joseph, so a lead that might have gone to seven or eight points only got nudged to 93-91. When the Cavaliers methodically went to their most savvy offensive options from there \u2013 a couple of Kyle Korver 3-pointers sandwiched around a driving layup from James, then one more rush-and-spin by Cleveland\u2019s dominator \u2013 Game 4 got yanked right out from under Indiana. Just like that, it was 101-95. From there, it was a few more bricks from the Pacers and too much Stephenson sideshow, wrestling Cleveland\u2019s Jeff Green to the floor in yet more antics gone too far. Indiana had been able to come back from a 17-point deficit in Game 3, but this time left its resiliency wherever it had lost its poise. Coach Nate McMillan didn\u2019t like what he saw, not early, not late, not in between. \u201cSimilar start in this game as the last two games,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cNot getting stops. Frantic offensively throughout the game. I didn\u2019t think we played the game the right way. There were some quick shots, some \u2018heroic\u2019 shots\u2026 You\u2019re not going to win if you play the game like that.\u201d Oladipo had company, what with Darren Collison and Bojan Bogdonovic combining to shoot 9-for-27, including 3-for-13 from the arc. Thaddeus Young grabbed 16 rebounds, but looked to be wearing oven mitts early when he missed three point-blank shots. The Pacers handed out an arena\u2019s worth of gold towels emblazoned with the word \u201cTogether\u201d for fans to wave. But the team itself looked more disjointed and, aside from some solid offensive execution in the third, too willing to settle. Whether it was overconfidence or just a really bad case of pinch-me nerves trying to put out in the first round a man who gets his mail forwarded to The Finals each June, Indiana has let Cleveland back not just into this series but the postseason. Every game the Cavs survive and advance is another chance for playoff newbies such as Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood and Larry Nance Jr. to add a little experience, feel a bit more comfortable. Each of them had his moments Sunday, mostly in the first half. And let\u2019s not forget how James handled a similar predicament three years ago. Chicago had a chance in the East semifinals to go up 3-1 on the Cavs in Game 4 at United Center. This was a Cleveland team missing Kevin Love after his shoulder dislocation by Boston\u2019s Kelly Olynyk, with Kyrie Irving already limping on his way to a knee fracture. James vetoed a David Blatt play-call near the end, hit a dagger fadeaway from the left corner to slay the Bulls and, at the end of his back-to-Cleveland season, propelled a rag tag Cavs crew all the way to six games in the Finals. Any potential parallels, then and now? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s to be seen,\u201d James said. \u201cI mean, 3-1 is a huge deficit and you don\u2019t ever want to go down 3-1 versus anybody, no matter if it\u2019s first round or if you\u2019re fortunate to get to The Finals. It\u2019s just too difficult.\u201d Going up 3-1 proved to be too hard for the Pacers, who have only themselves to blame. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And so they\u2019re heading back to Toronto with their first round series against the Washington Wizards tied at two games apiece, having struggled to deal with the opposing defense taking away what has been their strength all season. The Wizards held the Raptors to less than a point per possession in their 106-98 victory in Game 4 on Sunday. It\u2019s the same story as the last few years, except it\u2019s different. Prior to Toronto\u2019s \u201cculture reset\u201d of last summer, the way to slow down the Raptors\u2019 offense was to force ball movement by aggressively defending pick-and-rolls involving Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan. It just wasn\u2019t in the Raptors\u2019 DNA to take advantage of the extra attention paid to their two All-Stars, and they scored nine fewer points per 100 possessions in the playoffs (99) than they did in the regular season (108) over the last three years. The Wizards tried an aggressive scheme in Games 1 and 2 this year, and it didn\u2019t work. The Raptors have changed their tactics this season, have built better habits over the course of 82 games, and know what to do when DeRozan or Lowry draw two defenders to the basketball. From last season to this season, they saw the league\u2019s biggest increase in assist percentage (AST\/FGM) and its second biggest increase in the percentage of shots that came from 3-point range, with eight different Raptors having attempted at least 150 3s over the course of the season (up from five last season). In Games 1 and 2 , Raptors not named Lowry or DeRozan shot 52 percent (22-for-42) from 3-point range. With the series moving to Washington, Toronto had the postseason\u2019s most efficient offense (119 points scored per 100 possessions) along with a 2-0 series lead. So the Wizards changed things up in Games 3 and 4, either switching pick-and-rolls (when the screener\u2019s defender was another guard or forward) or dropping back (when the screener\u2019s defender was a center). And they\u2019ve found success by nullifying the Raptors\u2019 ball movement and actually keeping the ball in the hands of Toronto\u2019s stars, the opposite of what has worked against this team in years past. It\u2019s not something the Raptors haven\u2019t seen before. Plenty of teams switched screens in the regular season and the league\u2019s third-ranked offense knew how to deal with it. Against a switching or \u201cdrop\u201d scheme, the Raptors want to keep the floor spaced and allow their ballhandlers to attack one-on-one. If help comes, then the ball moves and finds open shooters. There have been some good possessions in the last two games, but not enough. And the Wizards have done a good enough job of staying in front of Lowry and DeRozan to avoid needing help. DeRozan earned 18 free throw attempts in Game 4 and both All-Stars have gotten more shots at the basket in the last two games than they did in Games 1 and 2. \u201cThe switching is definitely changing things but we are still getting off of it,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cWe are still getting in the paint. We are still driving, kicking and swinging. When they are making their runs and they are switching we still have to play our game. We still have to get one big down, play our offense.\u201d But most of those shots at the basket have been contested (Lowry and DeRozan combined to shoot 10-for-22 in the restricted area in Games 3 and 4) and the Wizards\u2019 adjustments have kept Toronto\u2019s supporting cast in check. With less help needed on pick-and-rolls, other defenders on the floor have been able to stay at home, close passing lanes and force turnovers (39 for Toronto in Games 3 and 4 combined). And when those other players do get the ball, there\u2019s less time and less space with which to shoot. After shooting 22-for-42 from 3-point range in Games 1 and 2, the other Raptors shot just 8-for-25 from beyond the arc in Games 3 and 4. And it\u2019s about the attempts as much as it is the makes. The Wizards have taken the Raptors out of their rhythm and made the No. 1 seed uncomfortable. Shooters have been hesitant, not having the time and space that they had earlier in the series. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the flow on offense, not at all,\u201d Raptors reserve Jakob Poeltl said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the shots we wanted. We got late into the shot clock almost every time.\u201d The Raptors still led by eight with less than eight minutes to go in Game 4, and the Wizards\u2019 Bradley Beal fouled out with 4:58 to go. But Toronto scored just eight points on its final 16 possessions of the game, and the ugly offense allowed the Wizards to get out in transition, where they\u2019re at their best. It was a blown opportunity to go up 3-1 with Game 5 in Toronto on Wednesday (7 p.m. ET, NBA TV). \u201cWe were playing frenetic down the stretch,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cYou have to give Washington credit. They played tremendously. They got into us, took us out of some things we wanted to do.\u201d These Raptors are different from the Raptors of the past. But the situation that they\u2019re in, unable to take care of business against a lower-seed defense that is forcing them to go away from what has been successful all season long, feels very familiar. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Bogut revealed in March that he wouldn\u2019t be returning to the NBA this season in order to remain in Australia with his pregnant wife. After being waived by the Los Angeles Lakers in January, it was expected the 33-year-old free agent would join a contending team for a playoff push. But Bogut said he\u2019d stay in Australia and focus on returning in the 2018-19 season. He tweeted that his wife\u2019s pregnancy with their second child has been deemed \u201dhigh-risk\u201d and she\u2019s not allowed to travel. Bogut played 24 games for the Lakers after signing last September, averaging 1.5 points and 3.3 rebounds while starting five games. He was acquired by Cleveland in the second half of last season, but he fractured his left leg less than a minute into his debut with the Cavaliers.

After Portland was swept by the Pelicans out of the first round, a surprise for sure, the job status of Stotts suddenly became a question. Marc Stein of the New York Times wrote how there was \u201cbuzz around the league\u201d that losing so drastically to the Pelicans could cost Stotts his job, given that the Blazers were the No. 3 seed and have now lost 10 straight post-season games. Blazers GM Neil Olshey spend lavishly on mediocre talent two years ago but that talent was young and the Blazers wanted to give it time to grow. During the season, Damian Lillard, the Blazers\u2019 leading scorer, had meetings with ownership about the direction of the club, and then the Blazers finished strong and those issues seemingly subsided. Until now. The Blazers have severe salary cap restrictions after a spending spree two summers ago, so unless something drastic happens, there won\u2019t be any massive personnel changes this summer. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be a fallout of some sorts, and it may come on the Blazers\u2019 bench.

It\u2019s the only time since 2001 a team seeded sixth or lower has swept a first-round playoff series. The upset was fueled by the heroic efforts of Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, who combined for a historic closeout performance. Davis, in particular, put his name alongside Hall of Fame players after scoring a game-high 47 points as New Orleans pushed its way to the Western Conference semifinals. Here are six incredible stats on the night Davis and Holiday put together: 1. Davis became the first player with at least 47 points, 11 rebounds and 3 blocks in a playoff game since Hakeem Olajuwon in 1987 . Olajuwon played 53 minutes in a double-overtime loss to the then-Seattle SuperSonics, recording 49 points, 25 rebounds and six blocks. 2. Davis\u2019 47 points are a postseason franchise record. It\u2019s also the most points scored in a closeout game since Kobe Bryant dropped 48 against the Sacramento Kings in Game 4 of the 2001 Western Conference semis. 3. Holiday poured in 41 points to go along with Davis\u2019 47. It marked the first time a pair of teammates in NBA history both scored 40 points in a closeout game. 4. The combined 88 points between the Pelicans\u2019 duo is tied with Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek and JoJo White for the most points by two teammates in any playoff game in NBA history. Havlicek scored 54 and White added 34 in their 1973 win over the Atlanta Hawks . 5. Davis and Holiday became just the third pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points on 60 percent shooting in the same playoff game. The other duos are Jalen Rose and Reggie Miller ( 2000 ) and Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler ( 1995 ). 6. Davis is now averaging 32.3 points in his eight-game postseason career, with a total of 258 points. Only Michael Jordan (283) and LeBron James (266) have scored more points in their first eight playoff games over the last 40 years."},{"id":40776,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-fines-wizards-markieff-morris-celtics-marcus-morris","date":"2018-04-22","title":"NBA fines Wizards' Markieff Morris, Celtics' Marcus Morris","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NBA has fined Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris and twin brother Marcus Morris of the Boston Celtics for their roles in separate incidents during playoff games. Markieff Morris has been fined $25,000 by the NBA on Saturday for attempting to escalate an altercation and pushing an official during a game against Toronto on Friday night. Morris shoved official Ken Mauer aside when Morris and Toronto\u2019s OG Anunoby had to be separated after a near-fight that drew other players less than three minutes into the Wizards\u2019 122-103 victory. Meanwhile, Marcus Morris was also docked $15,000 for criticizing officials after the Celtics\u2019 116-92 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. He was called for a technical foul in the third and was critical of the officiating after the game. In October, the brothers were acquitted by a Phoenix jury in an aggravated assault trial. They were on trial on charges that they helped three other people beat a man in January 2015 outside a high school basketball game. The twins played for the Phoenix Suns at the time."}]
