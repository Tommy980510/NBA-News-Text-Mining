After last night\u2019s victory against the visiting Miami Heat, the Cavs have won three of their last four games \u2014 all of which have come against teams either in the playoff chase (the Pacers and Heat) or on the fringe of it (the Pistons). LeBron James did a lot of the heavy lifting in the 91-89 victory Wednesday, finishing with 24 points and 11 rebounds . Although the Cavs were outrebounded 52-45 by the Heat, their defense came up big when it needed to late in the game. In particular, it was James who smothered Miami\u2019s James Johnson on a game-tying shot to seal the win. After the game, James was asked if he would have to contribute more while Love is out and had a concise answer, writes Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com : As Vardon also points out, James was above his season averages in rebounding (7.9 rpg) in the win against Miami. However, James\u2019 defensive rating of 111.1 is the worst of his career and could stand to improve there.

McCollum's 50-point game vs. Chicago Bulls","content":"Portland guard C.J. McCollum was in one of those scoring zones on Wednesday night, dropping 50 points on the Chicago Bulls in a 124-108 Trail Blazers win . Scoring 50 in a game is quite the accomplishment, but it is also a fairly regular one as five different players had scored 50 or more entering last night\u2019s schedule . * Recap:  Blazers 124, Bulls 108 What was notable about McCollum\u2019s performance was that he scored his 50 points in just three quarters. That feat put him on a very short list of players to do likewise over the last 10 seasons: Date | Player (Team) | Points through 3rd qtr | Total points 1\/31\/2018 | C.J.

Additionally, that 28-point total set a team record and, after his four-point second quarter, McCollum finished the half with the second-most first-half points in team history (32). Only teammate Damian Lillard had more, when he scored 33 of his franchise-record 59 points against the Utah Jazz last April . McCollum is now a member of the Blazers\u2019 50-point club, joining Clyde Drexler, Lillard, Andre Miller, Geoff Petrie, Damon Stoudamire and Brandon Roy. Additionally, his 50 points were scored in 29 minutes and 16 seconds, making him the second player in the shot clock era to score at least 50 points in a game in less than 30 minutes. The last player to accomplish that feat was Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, who dropped 60 points on Dec. 5, 2016 against the Indiana Pacers . \u201cI don\u2019t know what the right word is, but a very impressive outing by CJ,\u201d said Blazers coach Terry Stotts said after the game. \u201cWhat he did in the first quarter was amazing. It was fun to sit back and watch that.\u201d As the first Blazers player to score 50 points before reaching the fourth quarter, McCollum couldn\u2019t help but admire his accomplishment. \u201cA lot of elite players score 50 points\u2026it shows that you\u2019re a really unique scorer and have a lot of abilities,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cAnd to do it in three quarters is just a credit to our staff for helping develop me, hard work, teammates sharing, setting screens, sacrificing a lot of stuff.\u201d"},{"id":47654,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-grizzlies-sit-tyreke-evans-anticipation-possible-trade","date":"2018-02-01","title":"Reports: Memphis Grizzlies sit Tyreke Evans in anticipation of possible trade","content":" Memphis Grizzlies guard Tyreke Evans was held out of Wednesday\u2019s night game against the Pacers because of a possible trade, according to Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal .

The All-Star forward Kevin Love is consulting with surgical specialists in New York about fixing his hand, an injury which has rocked the Cavs, a team plagued by as much malfunction as dysfunction. Love fractured his fifth metacarpal during the first quarter of Tuesday\u2019s ugly loss in Detroit. The team\u2019s medical staff is reviewing treatment of the injury with specialists at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. There is still no timetable on when Love will return. This much is certain: The Cavs will miss him. \u201cHe won a championship here and he\u2019s been in three straight Finals,\u201d coach Tyronn Lue said before the Cavs hosted Miami. \u201cHe\u2019s been a big part of what we do, being an All-Star, being able to stretch the floor, being able to post guys and then just rebound the basketball, he\u2019s been great for us. \u2026 I respect him a lot and I know a lot of his teammates do and we\u2019re going to miss him. \u201cHe\u2019s valuable to what we do on this team and it\u2019s going to be tough, but we just gotta pull together and get through it.\u201d Early indications are that Love could miss as much as two months. Love\u2019s absence complicates things for the Cavs, who are 5-8 in January and in third place in the Eastern Conference \u2013 just ahead of Miami. With Love out, Lue is re-inserting Jae Crowder back into Cleveland\u2019s starting lineup. Crowder returned to a reserve role last week when Lue tweaked his lineup, putting Tristan Thompson at center and moving Love back to power forward. Lue went with a smaller lineup against the Heat, and said his lineup going forward will be predicated on matchups. Love, who previously had surgery on the hand in 2009 when he was with Minnesota, is the third All-Star to suffer a significant injury in the past few days. New Orleans big man DeMarcus Cousins tore his Achilles last week and is done for the season, and Washington guard John Wall will miss 6-to-8 weeks following a knee procedure. Love\u2019s injury comes on the heels of a drama-filled week for the Cavs. During a heated team meeting on Jan. 22, Love was questioned by teammates for leaving a loss against Oklahoma City and then missing a practice the next day because he was sick. After some details of the meeting were leaked, there appeared to be lingering tension between Love and some other Cavaliers players. Point guard Isaiah Thomas came forward to deny there was any \u201cbad blood\u201d between him and Love, but it was clear the turmoil hadn\u2019t totally subsided. Beyond the bickering, the basketball hasn\u2019t been good and Love\u2019s loss will make things much tougher on the floor for Lue, who has spent the season juggling lineups and rotations because of injuries and ineffectiveness. Love\u2019s injury continues the trend. \u201cWe should be used to it by now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think going through it all season, it\u2019s just been ups and downs as far as injuries and being in and out. But it\u2019s part of the game, we\u2019re not the only team going through that, so we just gotta like I said pull together, next man up, gotta be ready to play.\u201d If there\u2019s a positive with Love\u2019s injury it\u2019s that it could help Thomas, still finding his way back after missing seven months with a hip injury. Following the loss in Detroit, Thomas said he\u2019s still at only \u201c75, 80 percent.\u201d There\u2019s another wrinkle to Love\u2019s injury. Cavs general manager Koby Altman was already considering trades ahead of the Feb. 8 deadline and he may be forced to make a major move to improve this underachieving team. Cleveland\u2019s best asset may be the first-round pick it obtained last summer in the deal that sent star guard Isaiah Thomas to Boston. But the Cavs have been reluctant to part with it because it provides protection in case James bolts as a free agent this summer. Love\u2019s name has been linked to potential trades for years, but any move involving him now seems unlikely."},{"id":42022,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jj-redick-returns-philadelpha-76ers-lineup-brooklyn","date":"2018-02-01","title":"J.J.

(AP) \u2014  Blake Griffin described his reaction when he found out he had been traded. \u201cShocked is a good way to put it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything. I pretty much found out when everybody else found out. It just kind of took a second to realize, OK, like, everything\u2019s changing.\u201d Griffin has arrived in Detroit now, and on Wednesday the Pistons introduced him and the two other players they received from the Los Angeles Clippers in the blockbuster deal earlier this week. Griffin, Brice Johnson and Willie Reed should be available to play Thursday night when Detroit hosts the Memphis Grizzlies, and that\u2019s when the idea of Griffin in a different uniform will really become a reality. The Pistons sent Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and two draft picks to the Clippers. The trade came seven months after Griffin signed a $171 million, five-year contract to stay with Los Angeles \u2013 a fact that\u2019s been duly noted. LeBron James described the deal as \u201cunfortunate\u201d \u2013 pointing out that players are described as disloyal for leaving teams, but franchises don\u2019t necessarily face the same criticism when trading players who have stayed committed to them. When asked if he regretted not having a no-trade clause, Griffin kept the focus on his future with his new team. \u201cI want to play for an organization that wants me to play there,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is where I want to be, and this is the place that wants me.\u201d Detroit is in its fourth season with Stan Van Gundy as coach and team president, and the Pistons \u2013 without Griffin and the newcomers \u2013 snapped an eight-game losing streak with a win Tuesday night over Cleveland. If the season ended now, they would not make the playoffs, but they\u2019re within striking distance with plenty of time remaining. An injury to point guard Reggie Jackson has been a big issue, and Van Gundy has cautioned against expecting any immediate surge after Griffin\u2019s arrival. The trade was a risk because of Griffin\u2019s big contract and his injury history, but owner Tom Gores indicated before Wednesday\u2019s news conference that he understands it could take time for the deal to pay significant dividends. \u201cMy job probably should be to be a little patient, although Stan and I did talk yesterday, and our biggest job up front is to adapt as fast as possible,\u201d Gores said. \u201cOur expectation was always to win this year, so of course we want to win this year, but whatever happens this year, we have an asset for the long haul. This deal does not happen if Blake was on a one-year deal.\u201d Gores said the deal wasn\u2019t made to provide a short-term boost in fan support, although any added buzz is certainly welcome. The Pistons have played in front of plenty of empty seats at their new downtown arena this season, but a few more performances like Tuesday\u2019s might change that. \u201cI did consider the buzz it would bring to our players and our organization,\u201d Gores said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think for a second about filling the stadium. That would be very short-term.\u201d But if Griffin stays healthy and productive, he could easily become a fan favorite in Detroit, where the franchise has long featured physical, blue-collar players willing to throw their weight around. Griffin was asked about a couple of those former Pistons \u2013 Ben Wallace and Dennis Rodman \u2013 and whether he could be comparable. \u201cSomewhere in between Ben Wallace and Dennis Rodman,\u201d he said, drawing a laugh. \u201cBeing a coach\u2019s son and growing up playing for my dad, and him always demanding that I play hard and be a hard worker \u2013 both my parents are two of the hardest-working people I know.

In a couple days, the forward will get a chance to finally to play in a game again for the Milwaukee Bucks. Parker is set to return on Friday night at home against the New York Knicks for his first game in a year. \u201cThey said like 15 minutes,\u201d Parker recounted about what he has been told about playing time in his season debut. \u201cI expect to come off the bench. From this point on, I\u2019ve got to earn everything.\u201d When healthy, the second overall pick of the 2014 NBA draft out of Duke has the ability to score from just about anywhere on the court. He balanced an explosive first step with 36 percent shooting from 3-point range to average career-highs of 20.1 points and 6.2 rebounds in 51 games last year. That season ended on Feb. 8, 2017 when he tore his left ACL again in a game against Miami. Parker tore the same ACL in December 2014, ending his rookie campaign after 25 games. Parker\u2019s return comes at a critical juncture of the season, with the trade deadline looming next week and Milwaukee in the middle of the Eastern Conference playoff race. Regardless, interim coach Joe Prunty speaks with caution when asked about Parker\u2019s timeline. Expectations are tempered. Parker won\u2019t be the same player right away. \u201cThis is one of those things where he has progressed himself to get to this position throughout some very difficult circumstances,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cWe know about the talent \u2013 that\u2019s not the issue.\u201d As is his custom, an even-keeled Parker didn\u2019t show much emotion after practice. Parker said he had to challenge himself mentally at times during rehab, a process that removed him from the regular day-to-day activities of one of the NBA\u2019s rising teams. He thanked the medical and training staff for helping him get through tough days. There have been other challenges as well. Parker is in the last year of rookie deal, and talk about his future and contract status weighed on him before the season started. Prunty moved up from assistant to become interim coach for the rest of the season after Jason Kidd was fired on Jan. 22. Assistant Frank Johnson, who was close with Parker, also left the staff in the wake of Kidd\u2019s departure. Parker said that he has never liked hurdles, \u201cbut I accept it. Whatever is my journey, I\u2019ve got to embrace it.

The decision comes on the heels of a $125 million renovation to Vivint Smart Home Arena that debuted at the beginning of this season. The 2023 game would be 30 years after the Jazz last hosted the All-Star Game in 1993. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re in a great position to be able to be awarded that All-Star Game,\u201d Jazz President Steve Starks said. \u201cThere\u2019s a story to tell about Salt Lake and the Jazz and what we have to offer that we think will be unique.\u201d The franchise plans to submit a formal proposal in the next two to three weeks. Don Stirling, the executive vice president of the Jazz ownership group, is leading the project and has been working with NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. A host committee has already been created that includes community leaders and politicians. Los Angeles will host the 2018 game in February followed by Charlotte (2019), Chicago (2020) and Indianapolis (2021). There is a two-year bidding process and the Jazz would continue to push for the game beyond 2023 if Salt Lake City is not selected. Starks believes the growth and development of Salt Lake City will play a major factor in the bid. Salt Lake City International Airport is currently undergoing a $3.6 billion renovation. There are sufficient hotel rooms and a public transportation rail system that continues to expand. The Salt Palace Convention Center, which would host a fan-fest type event, is a block away from the arena. The city also has experience putting on big events, including the Winter Olympics in 2002. \u201cCompared to 30 years ago, our infrastructure is completely different,\u201d Starks said. \u201cWe knew with the renovation of the arena that would be a catalyst to get back in that conversation again. \u2026 We just felt now would be the best time to tell our story.\u201d The team hopes to leverage a partnership with Sundance Film Festival and possibly create a documentary around All-Star weekend and have a sports-related mini film festival. Starks also hopes to capitalize on a growing technology field in the state to put on a unique experience. Nightlife and entertainment options are always a concern in Salt Lake City, but the organization believes that won\u2019t be an issue. Stirling noted that All-Star weekend is when the NBA hosts all of its most important guests, from current and former players to owners, business partners and celebrities. \u201cOne of the things that ranks very high in the judging is proximity and convenience,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cWhen you land in Salt Lake, you\u2019re downtown in 8-10 minutes. The hotels surround the venues that we\u2019ll be using. When all is said and done, you have this great big world-wide event and proximity and convenience is really important.

Love fractured a bone in his left hand in the first half of an ugly loss on Tuesday night in Detroit, and the All-Star forward\u2019s injury and status likely will have a major effect on the team\u2019s plans to fix a season spiraling away. The Cavaliers are expected to provide a further medical update on Wednesday after Love, the team\u2019s second-leading scorer and top rebounder, is re-examined in Cleveland by team doctors. Early indications are that he\u2019ll miss as much as two months. Love\u2019s absence complicates things for the Cavs, who are 5-8 in January heading into Wednesday\u2019s game against Miami. The Heat can leap over Cleveland into third place in the Eastern Conference standings with a win. Love previously had surgery on the hand in 2009 when he was with Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow for our team, obviously,\u201d LeBron James said late Tuesday following a 125-114 loss to the Detroit Pistons, who were short-handed following their trade for Blake Griffin. \u201cAnytime you lose an All-Star or you lose anybody, part of your crew, it\u2019s a tough blow. We\u2019re already limited in our bigs anyway. We\u2019ll be getting a lot smaller now. \u201cAt the end of the day, we hope for a speedy recovery for Kev and he can get back on the floor as soon as he can. But it\u2019s a tough blow for us.\u201d Love is the third All-Star to suffer a significant injury in the past few days. New Orleans big man DeMarcus Cousins tore his Achilles last week and is done for the season, and Washington guard John Wall will miss 6-to-8 weeks following a knee procedure. Love\u2019s injury comes on the heels of a drama-filled week for the Cavs. During a heated team meeting on Jan. 22, Love was questioned by teammates for leaving a loss against San Antonio and then missing a practice the next day because he was sick. After some details of the meeting were leaked, there appeared to be lingering tension between Love and some other Cavaliers players.  Point guard Isaiah Thomas came forward to deny there was any \u201cbad blood\u201d between him and Love, but it was clear the turmoil hadn\u2019t totally subsided. Beyond the bickering, the basketball hasn\u2019t been good and Love\u2019s loss will make things much tougher on the floor for coach Tyronn Lue, who has spent the season juggling lineups and rotations because of injuries and ineffectiveness. \u201cGuys have to step up and be ready to play,\u201d Lue said after the Cavs were drilled in Detroit. \u201cEveryone has to play better. I have to coach better. Everyone has to be better. Especially when you lose a significant piece like that. I\u2019m sure the guys will be up for the challenge. It\u2019s going to be a tough task but we can handle it.\u201d If there\u2019s a positive with Love\u2019s injury it\u2019s that it could help Thomas, still finding his way back after missing seven months with a hip injury. Following the loss in Detroit, Thomas said he\u2019s still at only \u201c75, 80 percent.\u201d There\u2019s another wrinkle to Love\u2019s injury. Cavs general manager Koby Altman was already considering trades ahead of the Feb. 8 deadline and he may now be forced to make a major move to improve this underachieving team. Cleveland\u2019s best asset may be the first-round pick it obtained last summer in the deal that sent star guard Isaiah Thomas to Boston. But the Cavs have been reluctant to part with it because it provides protection in case James bolts as a free agent this summer. Love\u2019s name has been linked to potential trades for years, but any move involving him now seems unlikely."},{"id":42027,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/andre-drummond-excited-blake-griffin-join-detroit-pistons","date":"2018-01-31","title":"Andre Drummond 'excited' to join forces with Blake Griffin in Detroit","content":" The Detroit Pistons are eager to begin a new chapter of their franchise with newly-acquired star Blake Griffin.

But does Detroit have enough \u2014 right now \u2014 to make the playoffs this season? * * * David Aldridge : I\u2019m not trying to cop out on the question, but I\u2019m not sure. Four games out doesn\u2019t sound like a lot with 30 or so games left, but it\u2019s more than you think. I guess it\u2019s possible Blake Griffin could have a galvanizing effect and that the ball will wind up in the hands of better shooters\/scorers now for the Pistons than before. But chemistry doesn\u2019t usually happen that fast. Philly\u2019s going to get J.J. Redick back eventually and Joel Embiid is getting close to back-to-back clearance, so it\u2019s more likely than not that Philly gets rolling again post All-Star. Let\u2019s go with no for Playoff Detroit. Steve Aschburner : Will Blake Griffin play more games from now until the end of the regular season than Joel Embiid? To me, if you answer my question, then maybe I can answer yours. Philadelphia is the team the Pistons have to chase down to snag the East\u2019s last postseason slot (facing the No. 1 seed is no great prize, but hey, it\u2019s a playoff spot). Philadelphia is like two different teams when Embiid is or isn\u2019t participating, but that might or might not occur often enough for Detroit to leapfrog them. I appreciate Stan Van Gundy\u2019s determination, even urgency, to make this season a step forward for Detroit, but I think I\u2019m going to trust the Process and say no . Trey Kerby : Stan Van Gundy must think so, because he\u2019s tied his fortunes to a Blake and Andre frontcourt for the foreseeable future. And I tend to agree. Yes, the fit will be imperfect, but Griffin has played his entire career next to a center like Drummond, so maybe the adjustment period won\u2019t be as brutal as some would assume. And yes, the roster still has holes, but maybe Reggie Jackson can come back, maybe Luke Kennard can bust out and maybe the new-look Pistons can catch the league by surprise during the second half. Look at the Blazers last year \u2014 they added Jusuf Nurkic and went on a crazy post-deadline run last season before the league really figured them out. It\u2019s easy to see how the same thing could happen in Detroit. The Pistons were a borderline playoff team prior to the trade, and there\u2019s no doubt the Pistons upped their talent level by acquiring Griffin. Keeping Griffin on the court so that the team can figure things out is the next step. If those two things happen, they\u2019re a playoff team . Tas Melas :  Sure, it\u2019s the East, but they desperately need Reggie Jackson back. Jackson needs to be Lou Williams-lite for Detroit \u2014 handling the ball in late-game situations and hitting some big shots while running the pick-and-roll with Blake. Guard play is a huge worry for this team as currently constructed and Jackson won\u2019t be back from his ankle injury until at least after the All-Star break. Shaun Powell : Plenty depends on a few other teams currently with a better record: How much does Washington fall without John Wall in uniform for up to eight weeks; will the Sixers play Joel Embiid more down the stretch to secure a spot; and whether the surprising Pacers saved their worst for March and April. That said, if Reggie Jackson bounces back from injury and Luke Kennard does well with extended minutes and responsibility, then yes, the Pistons are playoff bound, provided one of those previously mentioned teams cooperate. John Schuhmann : Good news: The ninth-place Pistons have one of the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedules. Bad news: The remaining schedule of the eighth-place Sixers is the easiest in the league, and the Sixers have already won the season series (though they\u2019ll play one more time in Detroit in April). Good news: The Pistons are also just three games in the loss column behind the seventh-place Pacers (who have a relatively tough remaining schedule) and have won the season series against Indiana. The Pistons do have the talent to be a playoff team , though it will be interesting to see what they get out of their backcourt going forward. Their fate also could depend on the play of the Pacers as much as it does on Blake Griffin\u2019s ability to make an impact. Sekou Smith :  Certainly. I don\u2019t think the Pistons would have made the move to acquire Blake Griffin if they didn\u2019t believe they had a shot at making the postseason. And there is plenty of time left in this season for the Pistons to get rolling with their new core group, for the Philadelphia 76ers (who sit directly above them in the standings) to stumble and provide the opening the Pistons need to get back in the mix. A blockbuster trade like this one can work in Stan Van Gundy\u2019s favor if it lights a fire in that locker room and injects the sense of urgency that might have been missing before Blake showed up in the Motor City. * * *"},{"id":47723,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-can-milwaukee-bucks-claim-third-seed","date":"2018-01-31","title":"Blogtable: Can Milwaukee Bucks make push for East's third seed?","content":" * * * With Jabari Parker set to return to the lineup this week , can you see the Milwaukee Bucks securing a top three seed in the East by April 11? * * * David Aldridge : I don\u2019t think so. The Cavs and Wizards, with Kevin Love and John Wall each out at least six weeks with hand and knee injuries, are both vulnerable to be sure and likely to be bottom four in the East rather than top four. But I have the feeling Miami\u2019s going to be a buyer at the deadline and add another piece in order to rise to and solidify that third spot. Now, if Milwaukee moves John Henson or otherwise makes an impact deal at the deadline to add more shooting, I might feel differently about it. Plus, I do think it\u2019s going to take Parker a while to get back up to speed, and that adjustment period could cost Milwaukee in the short term. Steve Aschburner : With Parker set to return and with Kevin Love out for 6-8 weeks with a broken hand and with John Wall missing 6-8 weeks to knee surgery? That\u2019s how the question really sets up, with two of the three reachable teams ahead of Milwaukee in the standings losing the services of a vital player for the near future. But y\u2019know what, I\u2019ll still say no . First, the Bucks will have their own adjustments to make to adding a player rather than subtracting one \u2014 they\u2019ve got to learn anew how to best blend Parker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe. Second, Milwaukee doesn\u2019t need the first three seeds but it sure could use the fourth for homecourt edge in Round 1. If we get a little more separation among those teams, that\u2019s where I see the Bucks aiming: No. 4. Trey Kerby : Jabari Parker will help the Bucks in a lot of different ways \u2014 more scoring, more shooting, another starter-caliber player on the court to take a little responsibility off the shoulders of Giannis and Bledsoe \u2014 but he\u2019s still just 22 years old and coming off his second knee injury in four NBA seasons. Considering the Bucks are chasing teams that have one of the best offenses (the Raptors), defenses (Celtics) or players (Cavaliers) in the league, I can\u2019t see them making a realistic run at a top three spot in the Eastern Conference . Homecourt advantage in the first round should be the goal for this team. Tas Melas : Whose spot would they take? The Celtics and the Raptors aren\u2019t going anywhere, but the 3rd-seeded Cavs, in the words of the late Tom Petty, are \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d. I would pick Miami as more likely to jump Cleveland based on a more home-heavy schedule and less growing pains of working with a new (interim) coach and new-ish rotational player. Shaun Powell : Uh, no. You\u2019re asking Jabari Parker to hit the ground running after missing two-thirds of the season, and the Bucks are also getting used to a new coach and a tweaked system at the moment. That\u2019s a lot going on for a team that\u2019s still very inconsistent. Their ceiling is the four or five spot because Miami is on a roll and the Cavs will figure it out in time to prevent a free-fall in the standings. John Schuhmann : Kevin Love\u2019s injury might make things more interesting, but it\u2019s still hard to see Parker giving the Bucks enough to catch the Cavs for third place in the East . Prior to getting hurt last season, he didn\u2019t move the needle much on either end of the floor. But the hope should be that he can help in the minutes when Giannis Antetokounmpo is on the bench, when the Bucks have been almost 14 points per 100 possessions worse than in the minutes with Antetokounmpo on the floor . Either way, Milwaukee is the clear favorite to secure the 4 seed in the East, and not because Parker is coming back. The Wizards are without John Wall for the next 6-8 weeks and Miami isn\u2019t as good as their record (they\u2019re 4th in the East with the conference\u2019s 10th best point differential ). Sekou Smith :  No. I can\u2019t see it right now. Not from here. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. Jabari Parker could provide the Bucks with a huge boost if he\u2019s ready to get back to playing the way he was before his latest injury occurred. But that\u2019s asking a lot, more than what is fair, to be honest. Parker is probably eager to prove me, and anyone else who doubts the Bucks\u2019 lofty playoff ambitions, wrong. And he should be. But not at the expense of his comeback. He has to find his rhythm first. And with a new point guard and new head coach, that won\u2019t be as easy as some people think. A top four seed should be the carrot the Bucks chase the rest of the way. Anything beyond that is a bonus."},{"id":47752,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-blow-demarcus-cousins-ander-roberson","date":"2018-01-31","title":"Blogtable: Which loss will have biggest effect on team: DeMarcus Cousins or Andre Roberson?","content":" * * * Fast forward to the postseason. Which absence will weigh more heavily: The Thunder without Andre Roberson, or the Pelicans without DeMarcus Cousins? * * * David Aldridge : Oh, Pels without Boogie, no question. He and Anthony Davis were so good together, and he took so much pressure off of AD by playing center. If New Orleans does finish off the deal for Mirotic, that helps some, but the Pelicans are still diminished greatly without Cousins. Roberson being out impacts OKC defensively, no doubt. His presence allows Russell Westbrook and Paul George to be so much more aggressive defensively and on the weak side. But the Thunder can still win at a high clip without him. New Orleans can\u2019t without Cousins. Steve Aschburner : The Thunder will miss their guy more. I\u2019m basing that on their loftier ambitions and upside, pre-Roberson injury, than the Pelicans had with Cousins. New Orleans has wanted to reach the playoffs and, with their All-Star bigs, mess with top seeds Golden State or Houston in a contrast of styles. But Oklahoma City has wanted to go after the Warriors or Rockets for real and seemed to be coalescing into a group that maybe, perhaps, might have pulled off a spring special. Losing their defensive catalyst hurts mightily, by all the numbers and by any eye test. Now Paul George most notably has to handle a bigger defensive load and there\u2019s not enough manpower there, I fear, to counter the West\u2019s big-gun firepower. Trey Kerby : It\u2019s impossible to say now if the Pelicans would have been able to pull a first-round upset against any of the teams they might face in the playoffs, but New Orleans would have no doubt been a trendy upset pick when postseason prediction time comes. But without Boogie, not so much. He is too important to the Pelicans as a creator (second on the Pelicans in assists per game) and a shooter (leading the Pelicans in 3s made per game) to paper over his loss, not to mention his more standard huge guy contributions as the best big man in the game. Losing your starting center is bad, but it\u2019s even worse when he\u2019s also one of your best perimeter players. Tas Melas :  I\u2019m not sure the Pelicans get there so I\u2019ll pick OKC. Paul George now has to guard the other team\u2019s best offensive player and shed the habit of jumping passing lanes for steals. More onus on \u2018Melo defensively. \u2018Melo might even play some three if Patrick Patterson gets minutes. Billy Donovan has to settle on a new rotation which will always score, but, added defensive responsibilities will hurt that end, too. Shaun Powell : Well, I\u2019m not convinced the Pelicans will definitely make the postseason without DeMarcus Cousins. But I\u2019ll play along: Provided they do, then Andre Roberson\u2019s absence will hurt OKC more . That\u2019s because, even with Cousins, the Pelicans\u2019 playoff run was destined to be a short one, given that they would likely see Golden State or Houston in the first round. Meanwhile, OKC was playing its best ball when Roberson got hurt and looked to rise as high as No. 3 in the standings (and still might). Projection: His absence will cost them in the second round when they\u2019ll need defense. John Schuhmann : Can I fast forward to next week to see if either team makes a trade? It\u2019s hard to see the Pels winning a playoff series with or without Cousins. But if the ninth-place Clippers didn\u2019t just trade their best player, I might have picked New Orleans to miss the playoffs after the Cousins injury, so in that regard, it weighs heavily. (The Jazz have just beat two of the best teams in the league and have an easier schedule than New Orleans going forward, but it\u2019s tough to see Utah making up a five-game deficit.) Given their talent, Oklahoma City remains dangerous, though Roberson\u2019s value shouldn\u2019t be understated . Not only were their defensive numbers much better with Roberson on the floor , but no offense has depended more on points off turnovers and second chance points more than that of the Thunder, and Roberson\u2019s absence affects both of those numbers too. If OKC doesn\u2019t replace Roberson at the deadline, it\u2019s much tougher to pick them to beat one of the top four teams in the West than it would be if he was healthy. Sekou Smith : In the postseason, provided both teams make it there, the absence of DeMarcus Cousins looms much larger . The Pelicans were so dependent on Cousins and what he brings as a scorer, rebounder and playmaker that his absence could very well cost them a spot in the Western Conference playoff chase. As critical as Roberson is to the Thunder\u2019s defensive bottom line, the blow of not having him in a postseason series is offset by a player, in Paul George, who is more than capable of picking up the slack as your main perimeter defender. There is no one on the roster or in the city of New Orleans capable of doing what DeMarcus Cousins did for Alvin Gentry\u2019s crew. * * *"},{"id":47579,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-nba-trade-season-blake-griffin","date":"2018-01-31","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Blake Griffin trade tips off NBA trade season","content":"LA Clippers beat writer Brad Turner of the L.A.

The league\u2019s best scorer in isolation did more than step up while his backcourt teammates Chris Paul and Eric Gordon were impacted by injuries and forced to watch history from the sidelines. Harden took over the game in a way that no NBA player had ever done. Let\u2019s digest the night to remember with five awesome facts from his performance. 1. He became the first player in NBA history to record a 60-point triple-double Harden finished the night with a ridiculous stat line of 60 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. The 28-year-old also added a game-high four steals and one block. Most of his success came from inside the arc, where he shot a scorching 14-for-16. 2. He set a franchise-record for most points in a Rockets uniform Harden broke Calvin Murphy\u2019s team-record of 57 points set on March 18, 1978 against the New Jersey Nets. Murphy was in attendance during Tuesday\u2019s game and, like the rest of us, was in awe of the show put on by Houston\u2019s new record holder.  3. He posted 50-plus points for the ninth time in his career The 60 points against Orlando was the highest mark of Harden\u2019s nine-year career, but it also serves as the ninth time he\u2019s topped 50 points and the fourth time he\u2019s done it this season.  4. He posted the highest-scoring game of the 2017-18 season Harden\u2019s 60 points were the most points scored by a player this season since LeBron James dropped 57 points on Nov. 3 in D.C. Real recognizes real as James acknowledged the unbelievable performance.  5. His scoring average increased to 31.6 The NBA\u2019s leading scorer upped his per-game average from 30.9 to 31.6 following Tuesday\u2019s win. Last season\u2019s Kia MVP Russell Westbrook averaged exactly 31.6 points during his run for the award. Is Harden the frontrunner for this year\u2019s hardware?

ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst reports Love is likely to be out 6-8 weeks. The team says an official status update will be provided on Wednesday after further examination and consultation in Cleveland. Heading into Tuesday\u2019s contest, Love had been averaging 18.2 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, while shooting at a career-high 40 percent from long range. The 29-year-old earned his fifth All-Star selection earlier this month and was chosen to be a member of Team LeBron during the 67th NBA All-Star Game .

Despite the injuries, the Cavaliers (29-20) have managed to maintain the third-best record in the Eastern Conference, but struggles of late have brought questions to the team\u2019s ability to reach a fourth straight NBA Finals. Cleveland has lost 11 of its last 16 games and 10 of its last 11 on the road. The reigning conference champions, who hold the NBA\u2019s last-ranked defense , have shown no signs towards a turnaround and their latest injury appears to be yet another setback. Cleveland was expected to make a move before Feb. 8\u2019s trade deadline, but Love\u2019s injury could possibly affect those plans and lead to a search for a replacement while their starting power forward is sidelined."},{"id":47754,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/andre-drummond-replacing-john-wall-2018-all-star-game","date":"2018-01-31","title":"Detroit Pistons' Andre Drummond to replace Washington Wizards' John Wall in 2018 NBA All-Star Game","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Detroit Pistons center Andre Drummond has been named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to replace injured Washington Wizards guard John Wall on Team LeBron in the 2018 NBA All-Star Game , which will be played on Sunday, Feb. 18 at Staples Center in Los Angeles (8 p.m. ET).

The move is not without risk. We gave up a lot to get him, including Tobias Harris \u2014 one of the hardest working, highest-character players I know \u2014 and two high quality young men in Avery Bradley and Boban Marjanovic. But we are very excited to bring Blake Griffin to Detroit. He is a great fit for our team and will bring a combination of toughness and athleticism that will elevate our team and excite our fans.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to welcome Blake Griffin, Willie Reed and Brice Johnson to the Detroit Pistons,\u201d said President and Head Coach Stan Van Gundy. \u201cBlake has been an All-NBA performer, he\u2019s a five-time all-star and a player that commands attention whenever he\u2019s on the floor. His presence will help us offensively and his size gives us another rebounder and weapon in the paint. Willie Reed and Brice Johnson are two young players that give us size and depth. On the flip side, I thank Avery Bradley, Tobias Harris and Boban Marjanovic for their efforts and wish them the best moving forward.\u201d The Clippers issued a written statement from chairman Steve Ballmer: \u201cBlake Griffin had a tremendous impact on this organization and his legacy within the community of Los Angeles will be permanent. It was a pleasure getting to know and cheer for Blake. I wish him, as well as Brice and Willie, the best of luck. While change is hard, my confidence in our front office, led by Lawrence Frank and Michael Winger, along with the sage counsel of Jerry West, has never been higher. I believe today, more than ever, in our ultimate goal of winning an NBA Championship,\u201d Added Lawrence Frank, president of the Clippers\u2019 Basketball Operations: \u201cBlake is one of the best players ever to wear a Clippers jersey. We want to express our gratitude and respect for everything he has done for this team and the City of Los Angeles. This was a very difficult decision, but we ultimately felt it was appropriate for the franchise. We would also like to thank Brice and Willie for their contributions to our organization.\u201d Griffin, 28, has appeared in 33 games this season for Los Angeles (all starts) averaging 22.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in 34.5 minutes per game. He\u2019s scored in double-figures 32 times, recorded 20-plus points 24 times and 30-plus points three times, including a season-high 33 points at Sacramento (11\/25). https:\/\/twitter.com\/DetroitPistons\/status\/958324517419520000 Griffin has recorded five double-doubles this season while shooting 44.1% from the field, 34.2% from three-point range and 78.5% from the free throw line. The 6-foot-10 forward has appeared in 504 career games (224 starts) in seven-plus seasons with the Clippers, holding career averages of 21.6 points, 9.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists in 35.1 minutes per game. In 51 career playoff games (50 starts), Griffin has averages of 21.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 35.5 minutes per game. The former Oklahoma product holds a long list of NBA superlatives, first capturing the NBA\u2019s T-Mobile Rookie of the Year award in 2010 while winning NBA Rookie of the Month honors six times and NBA All-Rookie First Team honors that same year.  Griffin earned All-NBA Second Team honors three times (2012, 2013, 2014), All-NBA Third Team honors once (2015) and won the Sprite Slam Dunk Championship at NBA All-Star 2011. He finished third in the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player voting during the 2014 season when he averaged 24.1 points (6th in the NBA), 9.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 1.1 steals in 35.8 minutes per game. On November 11, 2016, Griffin played in his 420th NBA game and became the fastest player to record 9,000 points, 4,000 rebounds and 1,500 assists since Larry Bird (398 games). He also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as just the second player in NBA history to average at least 21-plus points, nine-plus rebounds, four-plus assists and shoot 50 percent or better from the field in his first 500 career NBA games (1\/20\/18). Earlier this season (11\/10), Griffin became the sixth-fastest player in NBA history to record 10,000 points, 4,000 rebounds and 2,000 assists (Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Chris Webber). Reed, 27, has appeared in 39 games this season (five starts) averaging 4.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and 0.56 blocks in 10.7 minutes per game. The 6-foot-11 center has career averages of 5.0 points and 3.9 rebounds in 149 games with Brooklyn and Miami. The former Saint Louis University product averaged 5.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 0.66 blocks and 14.5 minutes in 71 games with the Miami HEAT last season while shooting 56.8 percent from the field. Johnson, 23, was drafted by the Clippers out of North Carolina with the 25th selection in the 2016 NBA Draft. The 6-foot-10 forward has appeared in nine games this season, averaging 1.8 points, 1.4 rebounds and 4.2 minutes per game. As a senior for the Tar Heels (2015-16), Johnson became the fifth North Carolina player in the last 39 years to average a double-double for the season. He was a consensus First Team All-America selection and was named Most Valuable Player of the NCAA East Region, becoming the first Tar Heel to score 20 points and grab 10 rebounds in three consecutive NCAA Tournament games. Johnson led the ACC and ranked fifth in the nation with a UNC-record 23 double-doubles. Bradley, 27, appeared in 40 games this season (all starts) with Detroit and averaged 15.0 points, 2.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.15 steals in 31.7 minutes per game. The 6-foot-2 guard was in his first season in Detroit after being acquired along with a future 2019 second round draft pick in exchange for forward Marcus Morris. Harris, 25, appeared in 48 games this season (all starts) with Detroit and averaged 18.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 32.6 minutes per game. The 6-foot-9 forward has connected on 113 three-pointers this season, setting his career-high in just 48 games. The Long Island native was acquired by Detroit from Orlando in exchange for Brandon Jennings and Ersan Illyasova on February 16, 2016. Marjanovic, 29, appeared in 19 games with Detroit this season (one start) averaging 6.2 points and 3.0 rebounds in 9.0 minutes per game. He signed with Detroit as a restricted free agent on July 26, 2016."},{"id":42075,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blake-griffin-detroit-pistons-la-clippers-aldridge-analysis","date":"2018-01-30","title":"LA Clippers deal Blake Griffin to Detroit Pistons after superstar unable to elevate team","content":"In a seismic trade Monday, the LA Clippers abruptly ended their association with the team\u2019s seminal franchise player, forward Blake Griffin, sending the five-time All-Star to the Detroit Pistons in a package for guard Avery Bradley, forward Tobias Harris, center Boban Marjanovic and a future first-round pick. The Pistons will also get center Willie Reed and forward Brice Johnson in the deal. * Trade Tracker:  Every deal in NBA this season Griffin, second on the Clippers\u2019 all-time scoring list , was the highlight-reel road upon which the Clippers, long the far-behind second team in Los Angeles behind the Lakers, finally became relevant and a sustained winner. In a city that only responds to stars, Griffin became a superstar, with his ability to elevate and dunk giving the franchise a splashy nickname \u2014 \u201cLob City\u201d \u2014 and a reason for locals to come out of pocket to watch them play. Even after Chris Paul\u2019s time with the Clippers ended, with Paul engineering a trade to Houston before last June\u2019s Draft, the Clippers moved quickly to retain Griffin, giving him a five-year, $175 million max extension \u2014 after showering him with video tributes and making up t-shirts that compared Griffin with the likes of Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali , John F. Kennedy and Albert Einstein as part of their recruiting pitch. Yet Griffin couldn\u2019t resurrect the Clippers as a legit contender without Paul and other players like guard J.J. Redick, who left for Philadelphia last summer in free agency . * Top 10 Plays:  Best from Griffin\u2019s days with Clippers Only a game out of the last playoff spot in the Western Conference, the Clippers, according to sources, nonetheless felt they had overachieved, having to depend on player like C.J. Williams and Jawun Evans for big minutes and big roles throughout the season after a rash of injuries to players like Patrick Beverley ( knee, lost for the season ), Danilo Gallinari, Austin Rivers \u2014 and, again, Griffin, who missed a month of the season with a sprained MCL in his left knee . And that latest injury, according to a source, was a red flag to Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, a huge Griffin fan. As the season went on, the Clippers became convinced that they not only weren\u2019t a real contender this season, but wouldn\u2019t be next season as well with the current roster. So they were amenable when the Pistons came to them in the last couple of weeks with a proposed deal for Griffin. Nonetheless, the mood Monday afternoon within the team was \u201cterrible,\u201d according to a source. The hope, according to sources, is that the Clippers will remain competitive under Coach Doc Rivers, with Harris and Bradley joining Gallinari, who should return to the lineup Tuesday after missing time with a glute injury . And moving Griffin\u2019s max salary should allow the Clippers to be a player in free agency in the summer of 2019, with as much as $40 million in cap space possibly available. Whether their current lineup going forward includes center DeAndre Jordan, who is going to opt out of the last year of his deal this summer and is seeking a huge payday, or guard Lou Williams, who\u2019s had a renaissance in L.A. at 31 and is an unrestricted free agent this coming summer, remains uncertain. To stay competitive this season and next, one would think the Clippers have to re-sign at least one of Jordan or Williams, but getting flexibility in the next couple of years was one of the primary reasons the team made the deal for Griffin. That means tying up funds in a big deal for Jordan doesn\u2019t seem likely. The first-round pick Detroit is sending the Clippers is protected for spots 1-4 in the Lottery in each of the next three years through 2020, but is unprotected in 2021. Detroit had hit its own roadblock in the Eastern Conference. The Pistons were 19th in the league in home attendance this season, despite playing in a new building, Little Caesars Arena , that they shared with the NHL\u2019s Red Wings and that served as a symbol of a re-emerging, new downtown Detroit. The Pistons have lost eight straight games after a strong start to the season and are four games out of the loss column for the final playoff spot in the East. This was not the direction that Coach and President of Basketball Operations Stan Van Gundy had expected after making a series of deals and giving out huge extensions in the last couple of years. Yet despite a $130 million extension for center Andre Drummond , an $80 million deal for point guard Reggie Jackson and engineering trades for Harris and Bradley, the Pistons were still floundering. Detroit had been rumored to be in hot pursuit of Chicago forward Nikola Mirotic, whom the Bulls have had on the trading block since he got into a fight with teammate Bobby Portis. But the Pistons had a bigger prize in sight. Harris was Detroit\u2019s leading scorer this season (18.1 points per game) and most consistent 3-point threat ( a 40.9 percent shooter in 2017-18 ). Bradley had been a high-profile acquisition from Boston last summer, which received forward Marcus Morris in the deal. An unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end, the Pistons gambled that he\u2019d play well and that they\u2019d re-sign him, letting their incumbent two guard, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, go to the Lakers for nothing in free agency. But Bradley has struggled \u2014 more on two-pointers than 3-pointers, actually \u2014 shooting just 40.9 percent overall . As NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann noted Monday, Detroit is 3-17 in the last 20 games in which Bradley has played. ESPN reported earlier Monday that the Pistons, who still have high hopes for their first-round pick, guard Luke Kennard, had made Bradley available via trade . So, Detroit was more than willing to gamble that the 28-year-old Griffin will stay healthy and productive enough to pay for his max contract. The Clippers were painfully irrelevant when they took Griffin out of the University of Oklahoma with the first pick overall in the 2009 Draft . In a harbinger of his star-crossed turns to come, he missed what would have been his rookie season when he suffered a fractured left kneecap just before the start of the regular season . But he returned with a vengeance in 2010, winning Kia Rookie of the Year honors and getting to the first of his five All-Star games, averaging 22.5 points and 12.1 rebounds. He became a wildly popular player, winning the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest at All-Star weekend in L.A. by jumping over a car, and a sought-after pitchman nationally. Griffin had whole ad campaigns developed around his quirky personality, and developed his own comedy bits on his YouTube channel and for the website, Funny or Die . And his presence sold tickets, suites and other amenities for the Clippers at Staples Center, where their games soon began selling out more regularly than the Lakers. And in 2011, the Clippers engineered a blockbuster trade for Paul \u2014 who had originally been included in a deal from New Orleans to the Clippers\u2019 L.A. rivals and behemoths, the Lakers.  But then-Commissioner David Stern, acting as the chief decision maker for the then-Hornets franchise after the NBA bought the team in 2010 to keep it in New Orleans until a permanent owner could be found, vetoed the proposed Paul trade to the Lakers . That allowed the Clippers to step in and get Paul, and promptly become a championship caliber team with the nine-time All-Star joining Griffin and an emerging star in the middle in Jordan. The Clippers won at least 56 regular season games from 2012-15. But they couldn\u2019t break through in the postseason. Most egregiously, they blew a 3-1 lead to Houston in the Western Conference semifinals in 2015 , losing that series in seven games after blowing a 19-point lead at home to the Rockets in Game 6 . Houston won that game with the likes of Josh Smith, Corey Brewer and Jason Terry leading the rally rather than All-Star guard James Harden. And through those years of promise, Griffin suffered through both injuries and poor choices of his own making. He missed time with a staph infection in his elbow , and with a quad injury that hampered him throughout the 2015-16 season , culminating in a tear in Game 4 of the Clippers\u2019 first-round series that year with Portland \u2014 the same game in which Paul was lost for the postseason after breaking his hand. Last year, Griffin missed the final three games of the Clippers\u2019 first-round series loss to Utah with a plantar plate injury to his right big toe . Most discouraging for Griffin was missing six weeks in 2016 after breaking his hand in a fight with his friend and a then-Clippers stafffer, Matias Testi , outside a restaurant in Toronto during a road trip. Griffin apologized to Testi, but the team didn\u2019t retain Testi\u2019s services. Even after all that, though, the Clippers still were Griffin\u2019s team, and he was still relevant in the L.A. That came to a sudden end Monday. \u201cIt was a (bleeping) hard decision,\u201d one league source said Monday night, but one that puts the franchise on a new course \u2014 its destination uncertain. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

According to the reports, the deal will send Griffin, guard Willie Reed, forward Brice Johnson and a second-round draft pick to Detroit for guard Avery Bradley, forward Tobias Harris, center Boban Marjanovic, plus a first-round and a second-round draft pick. The Pistons (22-26) started the season strong, but have struggled lately to fall to ninth in the East. This move pairs Griffin with Andre Drummond, the league\u2019s leading rebounder and another elite interior finisher. With those two and point guard Reggie Jackson in tow, Detroit is hoping to shoot up the Eastern Conference, where the the fourth through eighth-place teams are separated by just two-and-a-half games. Griffin has spent his entire eight-year NBA career in LA and signed a five-year contract this summer to stay with the Clippers. LA currently sits in the ninth seed in the Western Conference with a record of 25-24. This move likely signals a restart for the franchise after its most successful era. The Clippers won over 50 games in each of the previous five seasons after failing to reach that mark in the entirety of their history, which dates back to 1970. LA decided to trade All-NBA point guard Chris Paul during the offseason, however, which appeared to put the success of the franchise in the hands of Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. Instead, Griffin is out, and Jordan is reportedly close behind.

Before last night\u2019s 122-112 loss to the Thunder in Oklahoma City , Embiid told reporters he was recently given the OK by the team to suit up for back-to-back contests. That means Embiid had a chance to be in the lineup tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). However, the Sixers are playing it safe and will not play tonight. He is being held out for medical restriction and load management reasons. The plan now is for Embiid to play in the back-to-back set the Sixers have Friday (vs. the Miami Heat) and Saturday (in Indiana against the Pacers).

As a five-time NBA champion and three-time MVP and Finals MVP, Johnson has climbed to the greatest heights in the NBA as a player \u2014 and is attempting to get his Lakers back there as their team president . In watching Milwaukee Bucks do-it-all forward Giannis Antetokoumpo, though, Johnson says he sees the kind of player who can do what he did: lead a franchise to a title. The Bucks have not won a championship since 1971 , when Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson guided them to those heights. Milwaukee also made The Finals in 1974, losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games . Johnson had plenty of praise for the All-Star Antetokounmpo, though, in an interview with ESPN.com\u2019s Nick Friedell : This isn\u2019t the first time a current or former player has lauded the Bucks\u2019 young superstar. Last summer, Golden State Warriors star and reigning Finals MVP Kevin Durant said he could see an MVP in Antetokounmpo\u2019s future someday .

DeMarcus Cousins was going after his own missed free throw , while Andre Roberson was executing one of his patented cuts along the baseline . One is an All-Star and a 25-points-per-game scorer on the league\u2019s sixth-ranked offense. The other is a Defensive Player of the Year candidate on the league\u2019s sixth-ranked defense. And both are done for the season. Neither team has an immediate answer for how they proceed, but optimism can be found in how improved the Thunder offense has been over the last six weeks and in how well the Pelicans have played with Anthony Davis at center. And fortunately for both teams (as well as those looking to sell off a piece or two), the injuries occurred before the trade deadline, which is now just 10 days away. The Cleveland Cavaliers should be the team that drives the market, but there are now a couple of additional teams with a need for reliable rotation guys.

The NBA moved the trade deadline up this year, feeling it kind of cramped the style of its All-Stars by constantly being asked about potential deals involving either themselves, teammates or other players coming to join their respective teams. And the league surely wasn\u2019t thrilled by the sight of DeMarcus Cousins being bombarded in New Orleans last year as he learned in the Western Conference\u2019s locker room that he had just been traded \u2014 ironically, to the New Orleans Pelicans . So, at the least, we can all enjoy Los Angeles in relative peace, the deadline coming this year on Feb. 8, 10 days before the All-Star Game . But that won\u2019t stop the rumor mill from going into overdrive, as it does every year as the deadline approaches. No matter how many times you point out that even though every team, at one time or another, has at least theoretical discussions about every one of its players, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re \u201cshopping\u201d them, or \u201cin advanced discussions\u201d about them, with other teams. (I\u2019m sure Turner\u2019s had \u201cconversations\u201d about trading me for Doris Burke. She\u2019s way better than me, for the record.) I can\u2019t do anything about other people\u2019s rumors. So \u2026 why not start a few myself! No, that\u2019s the intention. What follows  are 10 theoretical trades \u2014 trades involving teams that need to make moves, whether contending or rebuilding, players that need a change of address, whether wasting their skills with losing teams or needing more playing time with a contender. These are not \u201crumors.\u201d These deals have all been cooked up in my little old head. But they\u2019re not entirely loony, if you get my meaning. They\u2019re based in reason, not fantasy leagues. And they\u2019re designed to be fair to both teams. No one who consistently tries to rip off another team in a deal lasts very long in this league. Doesn\u2019t mean that any of them will happen. But here\u2019s why they should happen. And if any of them do happen, well, I feel sorry for you, \u2018cause you\u2019ll never hear the end of it from me. Favors has been a good soldier in Utah since 2011, when he was part of the Deron Williams trade with the Nets , but it\u2019s time to move on. The Jazz can\u2019t re-sign him for what he\u2019ll likely be seeking next summer, and the Cavs are, as we can all see, in some need of new blood, especially off the bench. That\u2019s where Favors could provide some low-post pop to compliment Kyle Korver and Jeff Green. Favors could well be a rental for Cleveland, but the Cavs can\u2019t be picky with their season slipping away.  Crowder\u2019s simply better than he\u2019s shown in Cleveland; whether he\u2019s still understandably grieving the loss of his mother just before the start of the season, or just is struggling finding a niche playing off of LeBron (it\u2019s been known to happen), this isn\u2019t who he is as a player. He\u2019s always thrived playing with uber-tinkerer coaches like Rick Carlisle and Brad Stevens who max his skills moving without the ball. Jazz coach Quin Snyder is in that mold, Utah is egalitarian on offense and the Jazz would certainly rather cover Crowder\u2019s $15.1 million due through 2020 than go deeper into its pockets to keep Favors. Williams has been outstanding this season (and, all due respect to Paul George, but I\u2019m on Team Lou to replace Cousins on the Western Conference All-Star team ), showing efficiency and passing skills that have not been a regular part of his go get buckets repertoire in the past. The Clippers have given some real thought to an extension for the 31-year-old. But missing one or two playoff gates would not impact Steve Ballmer\u2019s bottom line, one figures. The Celtics\u2019 $8.4 million Disabled Player Exception for Gordon Hayward would be the receptacle for Williams\u2019s $7 million salary this season. Boston already has the Clippers\u2019 2019 first-round pick (protected through the Lottery that year), so it could be as simple a transaction as giving that pick back to L.A. Or, the Celtics could hold out and offer their own 2019 first to the Clippers instead. Either way, this makes too much sense not to do for a team all-in on a championship this season and that could use some legit scoring punch off its bench. Utah has been sniffing around Mirotic for weeks, but the Pistons are, if not legally required to do so, very much in need of making the postseason. \u201cDetroit is desperate; they get my vote,\u201d one league exec said. So the Pistons could easily part with the as-yet unarrived Johnson, their 2015 first-rounder, along with Big Boban and Bullock (sounds like a \u201870s hour-long show on NBC), for the offensively gifted Mirotic. Of course, Chicago has to get rid of Mirotic after his fight with teammate Bobby Portis , and the Bulls have been asking for a first-round pick. They\u2019ll have to settle for half a loaf there in order to move on, while getting a year to see if Johnson can ever develop his offensive chops.  The outstanding Grizzlies\u2019 beat writer, Ron Tillery of The Commercial Appeal , tweeted Sunday night that the Grizzlies may move Evans to Boston , and that certainly would make sense, too. But Miami has that $5.5 million Disabled Player Exception from Dion Waiters\u2019 season-ending injury in its back pocket, more than enough to absorb Evans\u2019s $3.2 million this season. Ideally, the Heat would attach one of their bigger 2018-19 salaries to this package to get some room\/relief for next season, but hard to see the Grizzlies being interested in helping Miami get out of Tyler Johnson jail. So the Heat will have to settle for an Evans rental, which would help Miami\u2019s troubled offense ( 28th in points ; 25th in offensive rating ) immensely. Evans has enjoyed a renaissance in the Bluff City \u2014 19.4 points per game on 45 percent shooting, his best percentage in five seasons \u2014 and would be able to help Goran Dragic with playmaking duties as well in a pinch. Straight Cash (Dump), Homie, as L.A. has to get Randle off the 2018-19 books to pursue its two max free-agent dreams next summer, and will trade young for old and potential for an expiring contract like Ilyasova\u2019s. (Also, Ilyasova hasn\u2019t played bad at all as a starter in Atlanta.) Meanwhile, the Hawks are in talent-acquisition mode, and thus would have no issue either taking on the final year of Randle\u2019s rookie deal or re-signing the restricted free agent to be this summer if they choose. What do you give a team that\u2019s 23rd in 3-point percentage ? A career 38 percent gunner (who\u2019s shooting close to 40 percent this season) averaging 18.2 points per game on an Orlando team going nowhere. That\u2019s Fournier, who could provide interim Bucks coach Joe Prunty with some delicious high-octane combos (Fournier, Khris Middleton and Tony Snell together, maybe?). The trade could also surround Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker \u2014 who\u2019s almost ready to return and who would be a logical small-ball center \u2014 with another launcher in the veteran Speights off the bench.  Orlando would get the long-limbed Henson, who the Magic\u2019s new GM, John Hammond, drafted in the first round in Milwaukee in 2012 \u2014 and whose arrival would allow Orlando to move Nikola Vucevic this summer \u2014 along with the ever-pesky Dellavedova, with whom Magic coach Frank Vogel would fall in love immediately. Carroll has bounced back well enough for the Nets this year ( 13 ppg, 6.7 rpg ) to get repurposed for the playoff-teetering Nuggets, who could use his attention to defensive detail on the wings. And Brooklyn was trying to work out a deal for Faried this summer. His rebounding numbers are down in Denver this season, but it\u2019s been clear for a while that Faried is not in the rotation or the team\u2019s plans , so a change of venue is needed. Lydon also doesn\u2019t figure to be a long-term Nugget, and is worth a rookie-contract look by the Nets for a couple of years.  The Hawks move another solid vet, this time to a Pelicans team that was already looking to add to the roster before DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s devastating, season-ending Achilles\u2019 injury Friday . Without Boogie, though, New Orleans has to add more shooting and offense to surround Anthony Davis. Enter Belinelli, a gun for hire who can still make more than enough 3-pointers ( 36.4 percent this season ) to make defenses play him honest and give AD more room down low. And he\u2019s on an expiring $6.6 million deal that won\u2019t imperil the hard-capped Pelicans this year. None of the players going to Atlanta would likely be in the Hawks\u2019 plans going forward (Miller\u2019s only guaranteed $300,000 of his $2.2 million salary for 2018-19), but getting another future second-round pick in the hopper would be just fine. The Knicks are a player heavy, so it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll move either Hernangomez or Kyle O\u2019Quinn by the deadline. As O\u2019Quinn is making $4 million this year with a $4.2 million player option for 2018-19, he wouldn\u2019t fit for Washington, which is right up against the hard cap. Hernangomez and McCullough, though, make almost the exact same amount. In this scenario, the Knicks would actually be taking on a little bit more money \u2026 but they have the $2.8 million Carmelo Anthony trade exception in which to slide the rest of McCullough\u2019s salary for this season.  The Wizards would essentially be sending the Knicks a second-rounder to replace Hernangomez, himself a second-rounder, who signed for next year with a 2019-20 team option. The 23-year-old Hernangomez has fallen out of favor in New York , but would give the Wizards more energy off the bench to pair with Kelly Oubre. He\u2019s also another big man option for coach Scott Brooks in playoffs if he doesn\u2019t like either Ian Mahinmi or Jason Smith in a given matchup. No, this trade does nothing for OKC, or for Sacramento. (And, yes, K\u00e9pzeletbeli Kos\u00e1rlabda J\u00e1t\u00e9kos is a totally made up name that translates, roughly, into \u201cImaginary Basketball Player\u201d in Hungarian. I was watching \u201cThe Usual Suspects\u201d again the other night.) But Sam Presti always makes a trade at the deadline.

Picking third in that Draft , the Washington Wizards knew that Anthony Davis would go off the board first to New Orleans. But Charlotte was picking second, and with the then-Bobcats coming off a 7-59 lockout season \u2014 the worst by percentage in league history \u2014 many around the league the Bobcats (now the Hornets) would go for offense to try and draw back fans. The team\u2019s leading scorer in 2011-12 was Gerald Henderson ( 15.1 points per game ). But the Bobcats went for defense, taking Davis\u2019 Kentucky teammate, forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, second overall. Maybe it was because Charlotte had just hired a new, defensive-minded coach, Mike Dunlap . Or maybe Michael Jordan saw some Scottie Pippen in Kidd-Gilchrist. Whatever the reason, the Wizards, picking third, got the player they wanted \u2014 Florida freshman guard Bradley Beal. (This isn\u2019t after-the-fact second-guessing; this is what they\u2019d said, privately, before the Draft.) For a few years, as both Kidd-Gilchrist and Beal struggled with injuries, the jury was out on who did better than night. But today, the evidence points to a Wizards win. Still just 24, Beal has become one of the league\u2019s best scorers at his position, and has teamed with John Wall to comprise one of the league\u2019s top handful of backcourts. Beal has started every one of Washington\u2019s 49 games this season, after starting 77 last season, and is averaging career highs in points (23.9), rebounds (4.4) and assists (3.8), and was named to his first All-Star team last week . It was a big moment for Beal, who\u2019d already established himself as an elite shooter (and gotten $128 million from the Wizards in 2016 ), but who\u2019d been in the lab with trainer Drew Hanlen for several years working on his ballhandling and footwork. This after he spent his childhood getting beaten on by his four football-playing brothers in St. Louis. Yet despite his individual achievements, including a 51-point masterpiece in Portland while Wall was out, this year\u2019s Wizards have been a disappointment. They\u2019re in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, but they had dreams of a top two finish this year, after taking the Boston Celtics to seven games in the 2017 Eastern Conference semifinals . That\u2019s where Washington\u2019s season has ended in each of its three playoff appearances since 2014. But the Wizards have floundered against bad teams all season, and they\u2019re just five games above .500, closer to being out of the playoffs than they are to the top seed. The poor start led to a disastrous team meeting a few weeks ago that did nothing to quell the angst among players. It\u2019s forcing Beal to find his voice as a leader, to come out of his shell and try to lead this team to something meaningful \u2014 while not talking any more about extraneous piffle, like how the Cavaliers really didn\u2019t want to play them in the playoffs last year. Me: So, of Byron, Bryon, Brandon and Bruce, which Beal brother got the All-Star news first? Bradley Beal: I heard from my girl first. She called me and told me. I think my oldest brother had told me after that. He FaceTimed me and told me; he was, like, screaming through the phone. It\u2019s crazy. I feel like everybody else was a little more excited than I was. I\u2019m more chill, you know, cool, calm, collected. And it still hasn\u2019t hit me yet, honestly. It probably won\u2019t hit me until it\u2019s time to walk out there. But I\u2019m definitely happy, man. It\u2019s a blessing for sure to be able to share that floor with 23 other guys who are considered the best players in the world. Me: You were on the beach last year during All-Star weekend, right? BB: Yeah, I was in the DR. I enjoyed my little five days that we got off. Me: I always wonder, \u2018cause guys always say they can\u2019t wait to get away during All-Star. But do they really, or are you just a little ticked off you weren\u2019t in New Orleans last year? BB: I\u2019m never mad about All-Star. It\u2019s guys who get snubbed every year who\u2019ve proven they could be All-Stars. This league, there\u2019s 450 guys, and you\u2019re trying to pick 24 out of the group who are having a good year. It\u2019s a tough assignment, because you\u2019ve got the fan vote, and it\u2019s tough on the coaches because there\u2019s so many guys out here who really are All-Stars. Not everybody gets a spot. I didn\u2019t take it the wrong way. I accepted it for what it was. Like I said before, there\u2019s guys who don\u2019t make it every year who probably deserve to be there. For me, it was a break for my body. Me: Would you step to LeBron at some point in L.A. and go, \u2018okay \u2014 when did you pick me?\u2019 BB: You know what, I don\u2019t really care if I was last. I\u2019ll definitely ask him. But I don\u2019t really care. I wish they had televised it, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re still an All-Star. They\u2019re making it seem like we\u2019re kids, and our feelings would get hurt. It is what it is. But I\u2019ll probably ask him to see what he says. Me: What does it mean to share the moment with John? BB: I feel like it\u2019s great. It\u2019s a long time coming for us. I think the city wanted it. Our organization, that\u2019s what they see, trusting us to be (elite) players. Our owner, Ted Leonsis, always tells us, \u2018to whom much is given, much is expected.\u2019 They expect us to be elite; they expect us to be All-Stars; they expect us to win games. That\u2019s just another step up the ladder, another accomplishment that we made. The great act of faith that they had in us to go out there and compete at a high level, and then we get rewarded for it. So I think it\u2019s good for both of us. We\u2019d both would love to be there. We\u2019d both have been hot if the other one wasn\u2019t there, for sure. We felt like the last year, year and a half, we both should have been there. So it finally happened now. We feel like it\u2019s great for the team, great for the city, great for our families. Me: So I know if you knew what the problem was with your squad, you would have fixed it by now. So how disappointing is it that you have this problem, and have continued to have it all season? BB: It\u2019s very disappointing, but it can\u2019t get to the point where it frustrates us mentally. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve just got to go out there. We can\u2019t worry about the game that we just lost, as much as it kind of sucks to say, because we hate losing and can\u2019t accept losing. But the reality is reality. The crazy thing about it is we\u2019re only a game or two out of third. So that just shows, that\u2019s where the disappointment comes in, because if we could take advantage of those games, we could be sitting comfortably, be in the position where we could have home-court and have an advantage going into the playoffs. From that standpoint it\u2019s disappointing, but on the positive, we still have time. We have this opportunity, with these next nine games before All-Star to make it happen. Me: One seven-game win streak, and you\u2019re good. BB: We\u2019re good. It\u2019s crazy; each and every night, we may lose. Cleveland may lose. Toronto will lose. Boston, they\u2019ve been pretty solid, but they have their ups and downs, too. So it\u2019s open. It is wide open. We\u2019ve got to keep our eyes forward and focused on the big picture, get back to being that team we were last year, that grit and grimy, physical team. Me: Leadership is often an evolving thing on any team. So what is your challenge now, with this team this season? BB: Making sure that everybody\u2019s in the game mentally. I feel like physically, we\u2019re all men, and you should be able to get yourself physically ready for a game. But I think mentally, make sure that everybody\u2019s locked into the game, not worried about if you\u2019re getting the ball, if you\u2019re getting shots, not worried about if you\u2019re making or missing shots. Just control what you can control. That\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to be better at, fix my body language. \u2018Cause sometimes I can be nonchalant. I can be straight locked into myself and not say anything to anybody. That\u2019s not, like, a knock to my teammates. It\u2019s just my persona and my personality. As a leader, when guys look up to you, you can\u2019t be that way, and I think that\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned over the course of the year, making sure you have that positive body language, making sure that you\u2019re energetic, pat them on the butt, tell \u2018em it\u2019s all right, encourage your teammates as much as possible, regardless of what type of game you\u2019re having. And don\u2019t be afraid to say anything. Don\u2019t be afraid to be a leader. Me: What got you to All-Star level this year in your game? BB: I feel like it was just my confidence. I feel like I love where my game was last year, what I put into it. And over the summer, I didn\u2019t really add to much to anything; I just tried to perfect it. I think my off the dribble game is a lot better; my creating game is a lot better. The crazy part about it is I\u2019m not even shooting the ball the way that I want to (37.6 percent on 3-pointers, the lowest of his career ). I think that speaks volumes. But at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that I implemented into my game, in terms of off the dribble, my pick and roll game, my ability to pass. And just trying to rebound a lot more, too, as much as I can (Beal is averaging a career best 4.4 rebounds per game). Just trying to contribute in every aspect of the game. Me: When you and Drew work out in the offseason, do you have ideas for your game that you run past him, or does he have ideas he runs past you? BB: It\u2019s a two-way street. It\u2019s always been that way. He\u2019ll show me something, show me a move or something that he picked up from another player, and I\u2019ll try it out. And if I like it, I\u2019ll keep it, but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll scratch it right away. We have that type of relationship. It\u2019s a lot different with a lot of guys that he works out. He has a blueprint for everybody. But with us, it\u2019s like, try this. If you like it, you do it, and if you don\u2019t, you scratch it. We try to keep it pretty basic. Me: What\u2019s the next step for you as a player? BB: Man. Shooting off the dribble, the three a lot more. I think I actually did it more last year than I\u2019m doing this year. Being able to do that. Scoring more from the outside in that situation. And maybe a post-up game, \u2018cause there are times when I have smaller guards on me. Me: But no more team meetings, I take it? BB: When they first brought it up, I forgot about it. I didn\u2019t forget about it, but it was so long ago that we just kind of swept it up under the rug. I don\u2019t think we need a team meeting. I feel like team meetings should happen one time a year, and that should be it. You don\u2019t need to continue to meet and talk about what\u2019s going on. We know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s just a matter of us going out there and doing it. We\u2019ve got to look at ourselves individually and say \u2018what can I do better\u2019? One through 15, what can I do better? You could be playing well, but still, you could be getting better at something out there. \u2018Cause nobody\u2019s playing great, nobody\u2019s playing perfect. I\u2019m done with meetings, man. I think we\u2019re good on the meetings. \u2014 The Blazers\u2019 official Twitter feed ( @trailblazers ), Friday, 12:58 a.m., after Durant\u2019s postgame interview on TNT Thursday with Ros Gold-Onwude, in which KD exulted that \u201cfinally, somebody picked me number one,\u201d referring to being taken first in the All-Star player draft by LeBron James. Durant, of course, has famously chafed at going second overall in the 2007 NBA Draft behind Greg Oden, who Portland took first overall, and at frequently being named the second-best player in the league behind James. \u201cIf I was a San Antonio fan tonight, I would ask for my money back.\u201d \u2014 Gregg Popovich , to local reporters, after his Spurs were smacked around at AT&T Center Friday by the 76ers, just San Antonio\u2019s fourth home loss in 24 games this season. \u201cUnbelievable. I think it\u2019s just outrageous, in my opinion. I don\u2019t know who else made the team but got four people from one team, you\u2019ve got guys complaining about getting snubbed until they get in, you\u2019ve got guys just talking about it all the time. But the guys that deserve it \u2014 should be in \u2014 are not. I just don\u2019t understand. Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \u2014 Russell Westbrook , to local reporters, after teammate Paul George did not make the Western Conference reserves for the All-Star Game . Westbrook obviously referenced the Warriors, whose Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were selected as reserves by coaches after Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were voted in as starters, and seemed to be referencing Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, who had indeed complained about not making the team the last couple of years before being selected as a reserve this year. At least Lillard took it that way . And, on Saturday, George was selected as an All-Star \u2013 the NBA tabbed him as the injury replacement for DeMarcus Cousins on Team LeBron . \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting picked on last night. I was being a diva last night. I\u2019ve got to just own up to it. I watched it when I got home. I was wondering why he was coming at me so hard but then I watched the plays I was like, `Yeah, I looked like a jerk out there.\u2019 It was bad.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Durant , apologizing to referee James Williams after being ejected by Williams during last Tuesday\u2019s game with the Knicks."},{"id":47770,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-milwaukee-bucks-trying-realize-potential-after-jason-kidd-firing","date":"2018-01-29","title":"Milwaukee Bucks out to deliver on vast potential in all phases of game","content":"The Milwaukee Bucks have a notion. The Bucks believe that they\u2019re a top-four team in the Eastern Conference. They believe they are better than their current sixth place position in the East. And they believe they have at least some of the apparatus of a championship organization in place. That belief did not extend to Jason Kidd. Kidd\u2019s never-dull three-plus seasons as the Bucks\u2019 coach ended a week ago when the team fired him , but the questions about him and the franchise haven\u2019t. They come as Milwaukee is months away from opening its new downtown arena , paid for both by past and present ownership \u2014 $100 million from former owner Herb Kohl, $150 million from current owners Marc Lasry and Wes Edens \u2014 and $250 million from Wisconsin residents over 20 years, which will grow to $400 million in taxpayer subsidies with interest. They come as the team tries to go beyond its encouraging showing in the first round last year, when it took the Toronto Raptors to six games . They come as the team\u2019s franchise player and superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, starting his four-year, $100 million extension this season which runs through 2021, continues to weigh the direction of the franchise \u2014 and where it will go without Kidd, with whom he was close. (Reportedly, it was Antetokounmpo who informed Kidd he was fired , before management did.) But the Bucks\u2019 inexplicably awful defense, pedestrian offense despite Antetokounmpo\u2019s nightly highlight-reel level attacks and lack of overall identity, they believed, not only threatened this season\u2019s possibilities, but those of future years. \u201cThe difference is, at some franchise\u2019s evolution, in my opinion, \u2018championship or bust\u2019 is a mantra,\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s first-year General Manager, Jon Horst, said by phone Sunday afternoon, before the Bucks won their third straight game under interim coach Joe Prunty, who\u2019ll have the team the rest of the season. \u201cI think in a long-term view, \u2018championship or bust\u2019 is our mantra,\u201d Horst said. \u201cWe fully intend to be a team that competes for championships for a long period of time, and hopefully wins championships. We want to do that. There\u2019s a lot of steps for a franchise that hasn\u2019t been in consecutive playoffs in 14 years, or hasn\u2019t won a first-round series in, I think, 17 seasons. [Editor\u2019s note: Horst is correct, Milwaukee\u2019s last playoff series win came in 2001, when it reached the East finals] \u201cBetween that stage and a championship is a lot of really critical and important steps. You have a short window, and you want to maximize every part of that window. This is a chance for us to maximize this part of that window, building off of what we did last year. We want to do better than we did last year.\u201d Milwaukee never reached the heights defensively under Kidd that it had his first season there, 2014-15, when the Bucks were second in the league in defensive rating (99.3), tied for first in steals (9.6), led the NBA in opponent turnovers (17.4 per game) and eighth in points allowed (97.4). Milwaukee wasn\u2019t pretty in the halfcourt, but if the Bucks turned you over \u2014 which they did, a lot \u2014 they were off to the races. Assistant coach Sean Sweeney was demanding at the defensive end and got results. Point guard Brandon Knight led the team in scoring and assists and got serious All-Star consideration. Yet Kidd pushed to move Knight, and the Bucks did so at the trade deadline in 2015, sending him to the Phoenix Suns in a three-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers that brought Michael Carter-Williams , a guard with the size Kidd liked at the position. But MCW\u2019s problems shooting the ball consistently didn\u2019t dissipate and he made 19 threes in the 79 games over two seasons he played for Kidd. And the Bucks cratered defensively as well, dropping to 22nd in defensive rating and 17th in points allowed in 2015-16, numbers that rose slightly to 19th and ninth last season , with Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon providing steady play at the point. Milwaukee had hoped getting Eric Bledsoe from Phoenix for Greg Monroe in November would further bolster its chops at the point of attack, but while there was initial improvement early \u2014 Milwaukee was fifth in defensive rating in Bledsoe\u2019s first 11 games \u2014 the Bucks have slid back, down to 18th in defensive rating , 14th in points allowed and 23rd in opponent 3-point percentage since the deal. Their zeal to trap every high pick and roll within an inch of its life made them easier to attack in the long run. The inference, though no one says it openly, is that Kidd didn\u2019t listen enough \u2014 to management, to ownership, maybe to some on his staff. (The Bucks kept Prunty, Sweeney and Greg Foster from Kidd\u2019s staff, while firing Eric Hughes and Frank Johnson, and ending their relationship with Tim Grgurich, the legendary coach beloved by players around the league for his quiet work with them to improve, with no fanfare.) It nonetheless leaves Prunty with a challenge. \u201cThe biggest thing would be consistency,\u201d Horst said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve shown, on the offensive an defensive side, that we can compete at a high level and compete with the top four teams in our conference (though the Bucks are just 2-8 overall against Boston, Toronto, Cleveland and Miami so far this year), and maybe the top eight to 10 teams in our league. We just have to do that consistently. That\u2019s really the biggest thing. And beyond that, in our organization, we have experts. \u201cWe have experts on the performance side, we have experts on the coaching staff, we have experts in the front office and management, experts on the business side. And we all want to be accountable. We want to be self-reflective. We want to try to continue to be better every day. We love our roster. We love our young core. We believe in this group. We\u2019re constantly, in my seat, looking at how we can improve and get better. It\u2019s not like, make a coaching change and we\u2019ve done our job.\u201d The Bucks also face the further challenge of having a three-headed ownership group, which includes Jamie Dinan \u2014 like Lasry and Edens, a hedge fund billionaire from New York. The three men, who bought the team from Kohl in 2014 for $550 million , make all the franchise\u2019s big decisions together. But, like the precogs in Minority Report, they occasionally disagree. ESPN reported last summer that Lasry and Dinan signed off on making Justin Zanik, the Bucks\u2019 assistant GM, longtime league exec and former agent, the team\u2019s new front office face, replacing John Hammond, who\u2019d taken a lateral move to the GM spot in Orlando . Hammond had drafted Antetokounmpo midway through the first round in 2015 \u2014 when, while many around the league had scouted \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d and thought he had unusual potential, fewer were willing to pull the trigger on the then-19-year-old. But Edens, per ESPN, wasn\u2019t ready to give the job to Zanik. Even after the Bucks opened the search up, settling on former Hawks GM Wes Wilcox, Denver assistant GM Arturas Karnisovas and Zanik as finalists, Edens still didn\u2019t sign off on Zanik. Eventually, the three agreed to give the GM job to Horst , who\u2019d been the Bucks\u2019 director of basketball operations for nine years. But only Edens was at Horst\u2019s introductory press conference. Edens is the Bucks\u2019 Governor \u2014 the team\u2019s official representative to the league \u2014 and thus, per league rules, has final say on the team\u2019s decisions, the same way that Jeanie Buss does with the Los Angeles Lakers. But as a condition of buying the team with Lasry, Edens will cede that title to Lasry in two years. It\u2019s unusual, to say the league. \u201cThey\u2019re not overly hands-on. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s three of them,\u201d says a league exec who\u2019s dealt with the Bucks. \u201cWhat other organization in the NBA has something like that? I think that\u2019s what it comes down to more than anything.\u201d A league source with knowledge of the team\u2019s thinking, though, insists there was no disagreement among the three owners, though, about firing Kidd. \u201cEveryone was in full agreement,\u201d the source said. That would represent a significant change in the relationship between Lasry and Kidd. Kidd and his then-agent, the powerful Excel head Jeff Schwartz, were both good friends with Lasry. They had been guests at the wedding of Lasry\u2019s daughter just before Kidd retired. (When Kidd decided to become a coach, first with the Nets, he hired another Excel rep, the former National Basketball Players\u2019 Association counsel Hal Biagas. Biagas is now the head of the players\u2019 union for the League of Legends\u2019 Championship Series esports franchises.) It was Lasry who pushed to hire Kidd in Milwaukee in 2014 , even though the Bucks hadn\u2019t yet fired their incumbent coach, Larry Drew . The way Kidd came to and left Milwaukee, then, had a kind of unfortunate symmetry the Bucks would be well-advised not to repeat. Yet the Bucks believe in the significant investments they\u2019ve made both on the basketball and operations sides the last few years. Lasry, Edens and Dimon succeeded in making the franchise more of a statewide entity than it had been previously, raising more than $100 million from minority investors all over Wisconsin. They bolstered the team\u2019s sports medicine staff, made Suki Hobson one of the few women head strength and conditioning coaches of an NBA team, and made the deal for the new arena , set to open on time for the 2018-19 season as the centerpiece of a revitalized downtown corridor. And they got a big-time free agent to sign in Milwaukee, when Monroe turned down the New York Knicks in 2015 for a three-year, $51 million deal with the Bucks . Yet they\u2019ve been stuck in place, pretty much, for the last three years. They were 41-41 in \u201914-\u201915; they were 42-40 last season. But Horst does not believe they have to punt the rest of this season, and can make a go of it with the remaining people and staff. \u201cI trust people, and trust people with the opportunity that they now have,\u201d Horst said. \u201cWith this transition, we\u2019ve given individuals on our staff an opportunity to have more of a voice, have more input, prove that they can be even better at their jobs than they were before. It\u2019s trusting the people that we have here in place that they care about the company, they care about our goals, and their one focus and their one agenda is to get better each and every day and help us toward our goals.\u201d Antetokounmpo was close with Kidd, who gave him playmaking freedom very early, but was diplomatic about the move afterward. \u201cI reached out to him,\u201d he told reporters last week . \u201cHe was a big part of my success in the league, and that\u2019s one of my characteristics \u2014 I\u2019m loyal to people that I work with.\u201d Antetokounmpo\u2019s relationship with the team, per sources, remains solid. But obviously, the Bucks can\u2019t whiff on the next coach, whether it\u2019s Prunty or any of a group of very capable former coaches currently between jobs who would certainly be interested in further grooming Antetokounmpo\u2019s already blossoming game. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple \u2014 all Giannis cares about is having the best chance to win,\u201d Horst said. \u201cHe wants to know and understand that this is not a sign that we\u2019re going to throw away the season, because he believes that his teammates have the potential to do something special this season. We believe that, and we believe in them. Giannis just wants to know we have a chance to win now, and going forward. And if he feels that this is the case, he\u2019s fine. And I had many conversations with him about that \u2014 not even specific to the Jason Kidd thing. Just in general. And I talk with lots of guys.\u201d Yet the sense among at least some outside the Bucks\u2019 organization is that, to paraphrase someone talking about something else entirely, they\u2019re a little too high on their own supply. They have the hardest piece to get, of course \u2014 a young, legit, ticket-selling, charismatic superstar in Antetokounmpo with international appeal. But while they have good players like Khris Middleton and Malcolm Brogdon, they don\u2019t have a championship roster yet. Horst says the team\u2019s self-scout is ongoing and never ending, and that they don\u2019t have pie in the sky, unreachable ambition. \u201cHow do you evaluate that, to make sure you\u2019re not being unrealistic?,\u201d he said. \u201cYou constantly re-think, re-evaluate, be willing to look at things differently. For us, I think we think we can compete in the top four. We should be competing closer to a team that\u2019s in the top four rather than in the 9 to 13 spot \u2026 we should be trending toward a team that\u2019s a home playoff team. If you\u2019re a home playoff team, you have a chance to win a series, and if you win a series, you have a chance to win the next series. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not in a short-term view. It\u2019s really in a long-term view: where do we have to get if we want to compete for championships? At the end of the year, if we fell a little short, if we finish five, if we finish six, whatever that is, then we evaluate and we figure out where we weren\u2019t good enough, and it\u2019s my job to figure out how to get it better and improve that.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Hadi Sabaa: \u201c\u2026African-Americans are genetically wired to generally be more athletic\u201d? That sounds like something out of The Bell Curve, Hadi. I mean, I sucked at everything I tried on a field or court. Did I not get the proper wiring at birth? But, leaving that aside (somehow), I don\u2019t know how else to point out that people of color aren\u2019t represented in numbers off the court that reflect their numbers on the court than to say just that. It goes without saying that David Fizdale, specifically, is qualified for a coaching job. It has to continue to be said that, generally, black men don\u2019t get as many opportunities to coach, or be executives, or team doctors, or capologists, or whatever else you\u2019ve got on the non-playing side, as white men do. I\u2019m not certain how else you can get the point across. In 2015, a writer\/blogger named April Reign created the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite on Twitter to decry the lack of nominations in almost all of the key categories at the Academy Awards for anyone of color. The hashtag went viral, and started a movement that brought attention not only to the lack of people of color who were being nominated, but the lack of people of color doing the nominating. And it had an impact. There\u2019s still a long, long way to go , but there were a lot more black people nominated for Oscars for their work in the last couple of years. And it wasn\u2019t by accident. Reign didn\u2019t say, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t someone recognize the outstanding range of Octavia Spencer with a Best Supporting Actress nod in her next movie?\u201d She said #OscarsSoWhite. Everyone got the message. And then, we could have the snubbed players vote for players they thought got snubbed, and so on, and so on \u2026 From Remo Gana: I don\u2019t know, Remo: I think the current system is just fine. We can\u2019t make everyone happy. The whole point of the All-Star Game is to recognize the absolute best players in the league in a given season, not them and some others who may or may not have been quite on their level. Let\u2019s just leave it lie with 24 players for now. I like changing the format to basically get rid of the conferences. The next step \u2026 well, you know what I think the next step should be. This would quality as bold. From Ed Nasser: Well, that would be an interesting phone call, Ed. There\u2019s no way it would happen here on Earth I, but it would be interesting.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (25.8 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 9.3 apg, .405 FG, .750 FT): Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . 2) Kevin Durant (20.7 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 9 apg, .447 FG, .846 FT): One gets the feeling that there will be a lot of Durant cameos, gratis, in Two Buck Chuck commercials in the near future . 3) LeBron James (26.3 ppg, 9 rpg, 10.7 apg, .527 FG, .750 FT): Dubious Quad, which sounds like a garage band, for James in Friday\u2019s win over Indiana . 4) Kyrie Irving (30 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 5 apg, .569 FG, .867 FT): Watching Irving duel with Steph Curry Saturday night, it\u2019s easy to see why Irving wanted, so desperately, to be out of LeBron\u2019s shadow. That was fun. 5) DeMar DeRozan (17.3 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 6.3 apg, .429 FG, .778 FT): Later that night, he bent a steel post outside Air Canada Centre in half with his angry thoughts . http:\/\/Meanwhile,%20the%20Hawks%20are%20in%20talent%20acquisition%20mode,%20and%20thus%20would%20have%20no%20issue%20either%20taking%20on%20the%20final%20year%20of%20Randle\u2019s%20ro 15 \u2014 Consecutive losses by Sacramento in Miami dating back to 2001, a streak that the Kings ended Thursday at American Airlines Arena with a one-point win over the Heat on De\u2019Aaron Fox\u2019s last-second putback dunk . The Kings\u2019 last win on South Beach came on Nov. 10, 2001, when Peja Stojakovic went for 22 in a 90-75 Sacramento win. 9 \u2014 Consecutive wins for the Oklahoma City franchise over the Wizards in Oklahoma City , dating back to 2008, when the Thunder was in Seattle and called the SuperSonics (sniff). 292 \u2014 Points needed by Sacramento\u2019s Vince Carter to hit the 25,000-point mark in his career. Carmelo Anthony became the 22nd member of the 25K club on Saturday. If Carter reaches the mark, he\u2019d be the oldest player (41, as of this morning) to ever do so. 1) See: even LeBron and Steph agree. Televise the 2019 All-Star player Draft! 2) While DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s season-ending Achilles\u2019 injury is shattering to the Pelicans in the short run , I still see New Orleans and the big man coming together quickly this summer on a long-term deal. May not be for the max, and the Pelicans may ask for partial guarantees at the back end. But they need him and he likes them (\u201cthe first thing he said was \u2018coach, I\u2019m sorry. I still want to make the playoffs,\u2019 Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry relayed Saturday from New Orleans), and the partnership has gone more than well enough to continue. To me, this plays out like the Danny Manning situation in 1995, when the Phoenix Suns and Manning had, as teams and agents like to put it so they don\u2019t get fined, discussed concepts and parameters of a long-term deal that would follow the one-year, $1 million deal Manning signed for the 1994-95 season in Phoenix, all the team could afford that year under the cap. Manning tore his ACL in February, 1995, but the Suns honored their, uh, concepts and parameters and still gave Manning a six-year, $40 million deal in the summer of \u201995 while he was in the midst of rehabbing. Besides, Cousins\u2019 game has never been about speed or hops, traits that are often laid low after an Achilles\u2019 injury. He will have to be laser-focused on staying in shape, to be sure. But he\u2019s just 27, not 34 (Kobe\u2019s age when he tore his Achilles\u2019 in 2013), 35 (Chauncey Billups, 2012) or 32 (Dominique Wilkens, 1992). 3 ) Beyond happy to see Vin Baker join the Bucks\u2019 coaching staff, under interim coach Joe Prunty for the rest of the season. Baker\u2019s past with alcoholism, which occurred while he was a player, is well-known, because he\u2019s been candid and up front about it. But that hasn\u2019t defined him since he retired; he\u2019s worked his way back to being productive, both as an analyst for the Bucks\u2019 games on TV and as a purveyor of fine coffee products .  4) This man is wanted for impersonating a ruminant animal with horns . Please approach with caution between the white lines. 1) In a business filled with indecent people, Henry Thomas stood out, an agent with humanity and class who never overstated either his clients\u2019 value or his own. That he was one of the best at what he did only drove that point home. Finding out that Henry passed over the weekend was horrible, and for those who knew him best, like Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh and Michael Finley and Udonis Haslem, it must be an especially hard morning. Sympathies to them and to Henry\u2019s family, starting with his wife, Susan, and all that worked for and with him over the years. We\u2019ll miss him. 2) There is so much to unpack at Michigan State, but there\u2019s nothing that can fill the hole in so many created by the school simply not caring.

That may not be the only change happening to the Cavs\u2019 lineup as Lue is tinkering with the notion of when and how often two of his stars play together. Save for his debut game on Jan. 2, point guard Isaiah Thomas has been a starter ever since his return to the lineup. That means he is playing alongside All-Star forward LeBron James, which in and of itself is not a bad thing.

In last night\u2019s 121-104 win against the Detroit Pistons , James (27.3 percent) and Thomas (25.3) had nearly the same usage percentage . Late in the third quarter, Lue pulled James and Kevin Love and left Thomas, a move that helped the Cavs begin to take control of the game.

And if that wasn\u2019t enough, the Cavs are working on some potential trades before the Feb. 8 deadline while trying to fix on-court issues that have dropped them behind Boston and Toronto in the Eastern Conference. While Thomas played on some high-profile Celtics teams, he\u2019s never experienced the kind of spotlight that trails the Cavs. \u201cThat meeting or whatever we had was blown out of proportion of what it was,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut being on this team, you see anything that happens, it\u2019s a little blown up and it\u2019s a little more than what it really is. That\u2019s just, I guess being on a team with LeBron James, that\u2019s what happens. Every day is a new day and I think for the most part, we\u2019ve been as positive as we can be with all the extra noise from the outside.\u201d Thomas heard some boos at home in Friday\u2019s win over Indiana. He scored 12 points on 5 of 13 shooting and five turnovers in 29 minutes. Thomas is still trying to get his rhythm after missing seven months with a torn right hip labrum, and he\u2019s still adjusting to playing with James, Love and others. Until his shots start falling more consistently, Thomas, who averaged nearly 29 points per game last season, knows there will be those who doubt whether he can help the Cavs get back to their fourth straight Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in a whole new situation. I\u2019m used to having the ball every play. I\u2019m used to making most of the plays. So I got to figure out and this team has to figure out how we can use each other\u2019s strengths and use that as a positive. And it\u2019s going to work out. It just takes some time. And I\u2019m not back to who I am. \u201cAnd, I mean, I\u2019m not panicking. I don\u2019t think anybody in this locker room is panicking, but the people outside this locker room, which is fine. They\u2019re entitled to their own opinion. But one thing about me, I\u2019m going to keep pushing. I\u2019m going to keep grinding.

He\u2019ll coach in the All-Star Game (and against his Raptors players DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry) if the Raptors win once between now and Feb. 4 (book it) and it\u2019s a testament to his run in Toronto, which has been filled with lots of highs, very few lows and still awaiting a chance to play for a title. The Raptors have shown to be a stubbornly good team under Casey, especially the last few years, which saw DeRozan become a major scorer and Lowry one of the best point guards in basketball. It\u2019s a backcourt that once again has the Raptors among the top three teams in the East, but Toronto is more than just a pair of guards; a more balanced offense and improved defense might give the Raptors their best shot, maybe ever, to reach the NBA Finals. The All-Star Game, therefore, will shine some light on the job Casey\u2019s doing in Toronto and obviously raise questions about whether the Raptors, in light of the Cavs\u2019 struggles and Boston missing Gordon Hayward, have an opening this spring. As for the All-Star Game, Casey feels your pain. He\u2019d like to see a more competitive contest and recently spoke to the Toronto Sun \u2019s Frank Zicarelli about it: Kudos for Casey for telling it like it is. And more kudos for putting the Raptors in position to do something significant when the playoffs approach."},{"id":42105,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/orlando-magic-tough-situation-seeing-victor-oladipo-blossom-all-star","date":"2018-01-27","title":"For Orlando Magic, rebuilding process tougher seeing Victor Oladipo thrive into an All-Star","content":" The goal during rebuilding is to find a star by any means necessary. And if you whiff, especially in the draft where you\u2019re liking selecting near the top, it could set your franchise back years. This brings us to the Orlando Magic, who are on their second or third rebuilding plan (you forget how many by now) and Victor Oladipo, the All-Star they let get away. Actually, the Magic traded Oladipo two years ago and have virtually nothing to show for it today. Meanwhile, Oladipo will represent the Pacers in the All-Star Game in a few weeks while the Magic have nobody close to an All-Star on their roster. They took Oladipo with the No. 2 pick in 2013 and let\u2019s be fair to the Magic \u2014 Oladipo was mostly a tease during his three seasons inn Orlando. He was a solid defender, had great character, could bring the fans to their feet on a breakaway dunk and some nights looked very good. But his jump shot suffered; he never shot better than 34 percent from deep and at the two-guard position, range shooting is important in today\u2019s game. So the Magic lost patience and traded him to Oklahoma City two summers ago for Serge Ibaka and spare parts, which didn\u2019t make sense then and now. Ibaka was a poor fit and declining defender who only lasted a year before Orlando sent him to Toronto. Oladipo was solid in his only season in OKC but also was a distant second option to Russell Westbrook, who mostly ignored him and collected triple-doubles at a historically high usage rate on the way to the league MVP award. Oladipo was sent packing again when Paul George became available and the basketball world mocked the trade, saying the Pacers were ripped off, which essentially was also throwing shade at Oladipo, who was deemed a very expensive ($20 million-plus per season) second-tier player. Oh, well. Here\u2019s Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel  on losing Oladipo, in hindsight : This means that, even when it appears the Magic blew it, the image is not exactly the reality. Again, Oladipo was just a fair player in Orlando and maybe the Magic could\u2019ve used more patience with him. Yet he\u2019s in the perfect spot in Indiana, not far where he played college ball; the Pacers were thirsty for a scorer after losing George and are giving Oladipo the freedom he lacked in OKC and, to an extent, in Orlando. Also, give Oladipo props for raising his game and being prepared when opportunity knocked. Meanwhile, the Magic are no better off without him. That\u2019s the real crime here. That\u2019s why it hurts in Orlando. They\u2019ve got nothing to show for losing Oladipo and now must go into another draft looking for someone who\u2019ll blossom into an All-Star one day. Someone like Oladipo."},{"id":42111,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-should-take-tip-lebron-james-kyrie-irving","date":"2018-01-27","title":"When it comes to putting issues aside, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook should take a tip from LeBron James and Kyrie Irving","content":" The most interesting teammate tandem in the All-Star Game will be Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. The two were teammates in last year\u2019s game and the tension was evident during practice, when they didn\u2019t interact, and also somewhat during the game, when they interacted only because, well, millions were watching. They should take a tip from the second most interesting tandem \u2014 LeBron James and Kyrie Irving \u2014 and bury the hatchet. Any thought of LeBron holding a grudge against Irving for demanding and getting a trade to the Celtics last summer ended when LeBron as captain chose Kyrie for his squad in the Feb. 18 game. Would Westbrook do the same for KD? You probably know the answer to that. Anyway, it will be a reunion of 2016 champions when LeBron, Irving and Kevin Love share the same uniform again . Here\u2019s Chris Forsberg of ESPN.com speaking with Irving: And that\u2019s the key, really, and the difference between LeBron-Irving and KD-Westbrook: At least the former Cavs teammates won something together. Westbrook\u2019s beef with KD appears to be over such matters; remember, the Thunder had a 3-1 lead on the Warriors before KD signed with the Warriors. Westbrook thought, and maybe rightly so, that OKC was close and could\u2019ve beaten the Warriors the next season. Remember, that summer they traded Serge Ibaka for Victor Oladipo, who curiously will also play in the All-Star Game. The All-Star Weekend is the right time to put issues aside for the greater good of the game and to keep the climate tension-free and also for your own mental health. Maybe KD and especially Russ will get the message this time."},{"id":42114,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-orleans-pelicans-next-move-demarcus-cousins-out-season","date":"2018-01-27","title":"With DeMarcus Cousins lost for the season, what comes next for the New Orleans Pelicans?","content":" So what do you do now, if you\u2019re the Pelicans? DeMarcus Cousins suffered a torn left Achilles injury Friday night and his projected time in street clothes will be determined sometime today. From the looks of things, it\u2019s fair to project Cousins missing significant time and his season, given that it\u2019s an Achilles, would be over. The bigger issue for the Pelicans is what his absence, and impending free agency, means to the health of the franchise. It\u2019s a tricky situation, to be sure. First of all, it\u2019s rare when an NBA player his size suffers an Achilles injury, which is more common to slashers and smaller players. That could dictate how much time he\u2019ll miss, but again, that\u2019s up to the doctors and therapists and experts. Cousins is an unrestricted free agent this summer and if his injury is severe and will require surgery, the Pelicans won\u2019t have the luxury of seeing how well he recovers before July 1. Cousins, had he stayed healthy, would\u2019ve surely commanded a max contract. Is that still on the table now? In the much shorter term, there\u2019s the matter of this season and how it\u2019ll play out. Cousins and Anthony Davis gave the Pelicans a unique look and put New Orleans squarely in the playoff picture. Without Cousins, that changes, most likely. It\u2019ll be up to Davis, once again, to carry the club, and as talented as the All-Star forward is, there\u2019s plenty of competition for the last three or four playoff spots in the West. Finally: The trade deadline is in a few weeks. Curiously, Cousins wasn\u2019t guaranteed to stay in New Orleans beyond the deadline because of his contract situation. Is there any way for New Orleans to pull off a deal for a player who can help this season? Or is that too ambitious for a franchise that, beyond Davis and Cousins and maybe Jrue Holiday, lacks assets other than its No. 1 pick? Just by coincidence, Davis and Cousins are subjects on the current cover of Slam Magazine, where writer Abe Schwadron penned this about the chemistry between the big men : Any way you examine it, Cousins\u2019 injury was a terrible blow for him and the franchise. Just when he and New Orleans had turned a corner, this happens. There are no easy questions, and the answers are difficult and complex. And of course, the biggest question: What does this mean for Davis and his future in New Orleans?"},{"id":42109,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-teams-wish-speedy-recovery-demarcus-cousins","date":"2018-01-27","title":"NBA players, teams wish speedy recovery to DeMarcus Cousins","content":"The NBA family reached out to DeMarcus Cousins on Friday night after the All-Star big man suffered a season-ending injury to his left Achilles.

His public rebuke of an All-Star voting and selection process that didn\u2019t include George , his trademark snarl at the first sign of anyone doubting him and the monster production he delivers in the face of any sign of disrespect is all there. It comes at the perfect time, with the Thunder riding the wave of a six-game win streak after Thursday\u2019s win over the visiting Washington Wizards and their All-Star backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal.

And if you don\u2019t think Westbrook\u2019s season-high 46-point night was fueled by the circumstance, no matter what he says, then you haven\u2019t paid attention to Westbrook. * Schuhmann:  Westbrook shifts game away from 3-point line \u201cI just read the game honestly, and if it\u2019s time for me to take over, then that\u2019s what I do,\u201d Westbrook told reporters after shredding the Wizards\u2019 defense, making 19 of his 29 shots (1-for-3 from 3-point range) in what was easily one of his most efficient offensive outings of the season. Westbrook feeds off a lack of respect better than any other player in the game, and usually lets his effort and energy do the talking instead of engaging in a public back-and-forth the way he did after labeling George the biggest All-Star snub. There will be more of this in the days and weeks leading up to the Feb. 18 All-Star Game , which will take place in Westbrook\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles. You know he won\u2019t be shy about chasing MVP honors that night as a member of Team LeBron , alongside his former Thunder teammate Kevin Durant, when the league\u2019s biggest stars hit the Staples Center floor for the league\u2019s 67th All-Star showcase . The stretch run of the regular season will offer more opportunities for Westbrook and the Thunder to prove they belong among the league\u2019s elite. The time for patience, it appears, is over. * * * The top five in the Week 15 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  31.2 points, 9.0 assists, 4.8 rebounds It didn\u2019t take Harden long to regain his form after missing seven games with that hamstring injury. Since his return, the Rockets have won four straight games, locked up the season series (2-1) against the Golden State Warriors and made the statement to the rest of the league that they\u2019re serious championship contenders. Harden didn\u2019t go all Clint Capela and proclaim his team as the league\u2019s top dog just because they finished on the right side of the regular-season series against the Warriors. But he\u2019d be right to have his confidence sky-high given the fact the Rockets are 17-0 when he, Chris Paul and Capela are in the starting lineup together . That makes tonight\u2019s game against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 8 ET, ESPN ) and their All-Star starters DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis extra spicy. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists Durant got it all in Thursday. He picked up that $15,000 fine for his public criticism of a game official , was the first pick in the All-Star Draft (joining Team LeBron) and then capped things off with a 28-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound performance in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves at Oracle Arena. None of it should come as a surprise from Durant, who also added three blocks and two steals to his stat line last night. The nine-time All-Star said after the game he was humbled by being picked first in the All-Star draft (something he believes to be true ). Durant was the No. 2 overall pick in his Draft class and has always said that served as part of his motivation. But the man who has developed into one of the league\u2019s truly elite two-way players since joining the Warriors, is riding high these days with the Warriors cruising toward the All-Star break. He\u2019s averaging 26.3 points (on .556 shooting), 7.5 assists, 6.3 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.3 blocks in his last 10 games. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 8 Season stats:  25.4 points, 9.9 assists, 9.5 rebounds Westbrook and the Thunder took their lumps early this season as they worked to get comfortable with Paul George and Carmelo Anthony sharing the leadership load. And now that they have found the right vibe, they\u2019ve won 20 of 28 after starting the season after an uneven 8-12 start. That success is in large part because Westbrook has gotten back to the style that helped him win the 2016-17 Kia MVP . He\u2019s not on the same triple-double pace and isn\u2019t chasing a scoring title, but he\u2019s not far off. And the Thunder, winners of six straight, are better with Russ doing his \u201cLil\u2019 Rage\u201d routine on a regular basis. He was spectacular Thursday night, plowing over and through the Washington Wizards and their All-Star backcourt of John Wall and Bradley Beal for a season-high 46 points, six rebounds, six assists and three steals. Westbrook isn\u2019t happy about being the Thunder\u2019s only All-Star ( see his lobbying for George earlier this week ) which means the rest of the league \u2014 and the teams on the Thunder schedule between now and Feb. 18 \u2014 will pay. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  27.5 points, 6.6 assists, 5.2 rebounds Curry is taking the criticism of his All-Star Draft work in stride, defending his picks after Thursday night\u2019s reveal on TNT of the rosters for next month\u2019s All-Star Game with his trademark wit . Anyone focusing on Steph\u2019s GM skills, however, is missing the point. He\u2019s been on fire of late, knocking down 48.3 percent of his 3-pointers in his last five games while averaging 28.8 points (on .500 shooting), 7.1 assists, 5.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists in his past 10 games. He followed up an ugly 6-for-20 shooting performance in a loss to Houston last weekend with a 32-point shelling of the New York Knicks (he was 8-for-15 from deep) and a stellar 25-point (5-for-9 from distance), nine-assist, five-rebound, three-steal performance in the Warriors\u2019 win over Minnesota last night . Remarkably, Steph\u2019s scoring is up from last season (from 25.3) in Year 2 alongside Kevin Durant. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 6 Season stats:  26.8 points, 8.6 assists, 7.9 rebounds As poorly as the Cavaliers have played since Christmas, LeBron shouldn\u2019t shoulder the blame for teammates who can\u2019t seem to find their mark. While the Cavaliers\u2019 recent ugly stretch has seen them lose 10 of their last 13 games, LeBron became just the seventh player in NBA history to reach the 30,000-point plateau and also earned the most votes in the All-Star balloting . Make no mistake, though: the Cavaliers\u2019 issues are real. Changes to the starting lineup and rotation are clearly needed for a team struggling like Cleveland is. But LeBron, who has averaged 23.3 points, 6.7 poiints and 6.6 assists (on .511 shooting) over his last 10 games is the least of coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s problems. Those problems, however, could perhaps be addressed by the Feb. 8 trade deadline. 6. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 7. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 8. DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans 9. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks And five more \u2026: LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs, Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Chris Paul, Houston Rockets An inside look at Goran Dragic from an Eastern Conference executive: \u201cI\u2019ve listened to all of this stuff about guys being snubbed for the All-Star Game and who should and should not be included, and I think the one guy who I\u2019ve been surprised hasn\u2019t come up more often is Dragic. He doesn\u2019t have the gaudy numbers and he\u2019s not nearly as flashy at this stage of his career, but I\u2019d make the case for him based on the impact he\u2019s had on one of the top teams in the conference. The coaches know what he brings to the table. He\u2019s running that team extremely well, picking his spots and really doing exactly what (Heat coach Erik) Spo(elstra) is asking him to. When you have a team like that, with so many guys who have gotten paid and are all battling for positions in the rotation, it can get a little sticky when you are the one with he ball in your hands and triggering the offense. That responsibility, the floor leadership, is where I think he\u2019s made his greatest strides since earlier in his career. In Phoenix, he struck me as more of a one-trick pony, a scoring point guard who really didn\u2019t have a great feel for how to consistently facilitate for his guys. \u201cHe never had a problem getting his own shot and scoring with the best of them. But his game has evolved nicely. He\u2019s by no means a lock-down defender, but his effort is righteous. It\u2019s legit. I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that his work with the [Slovenian] national team played a part in the development. When you have that burden and take that team to the title at EuroBasket, it says a lot about what type of leader he has become. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more important in Miami that he continues to fine-tune those leadership skills than worry about being an All-Star. And like I said, you haven\u2019t heard anything from anyone down there chirping about him being disrespected or snubbed. They are focused, and rightfully so, on the bigger picture and where this guy can lead them in the playoff hunt. They\u2019ve got a chance to earn a top three or four seed. That\u2019s most important. The fact that he\u2019s focused on that is what really shows the growth.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Guesses were already flowing, however, that Kevin Durant was indeed James\u2019 first selection. Not only is he considered one of the best players in the league, but picking Durant also prevented Stephen Curry, the other team captain, from making sure he and his Warriors\u2019 teammate remained on the same squad. Anthony Slate of The Athletic later asked Durant if he was indeed the first overall pick.

Stephen Curry picked James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA\u2019s top two scorers, and grabbed his other two Golden State teammates in the selections Thursday. The draft was not televised, and neither James nor Curry would reveal who they chose first when they were interviewed on TNT when the rosters were unveiled. James was among those who said fans should have watched the proceedings and his decision to draft Irving could have made for a must-see moment. The point guard asked out of Cleveland last summer and the Cavaliers traded him to conference rival Boston. \u201cKyrie was available on the draft board, he\u2019s one of the best point guards we have in our league,\u201d James said. \u201cIt was an easy choice for me.\u201d James and Curry will be the captains Feb. 18 in Los Angeles for the first NBA All-Star Game that doesn\u2019t use the Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference format. James had the No. 1 pick as a result of earning the most votes in fan balloting, while Curry had the first pick in the reserve round after the starters were selected. He passed on Russell Westbrook, the NBA MVP who instead ended up on Team LeBron. The league is hoping that trying something new will bring back some old-school intensity that has been absent from the last two games, when the West nearly scored 200 points. James also took the New Orleans duo of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. His other reserves are Cleveland teammate Kevin Love, Washington guards John Wall and Bradley Beal, LaMarcus Aldridge of San Antonio, Indiana\u2019s Victor Oladipo and Kristaps Porzingis of New York.

The 67th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 18 (8 p.m. ET) at Staples Center in Los Angeles, airing on TNT and ESPN Radio. The game will reach fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 40 languages. The 2018 NBA All-Star Draft was conducted today via conference call. As the All-Star starter from each conference who received the most fan votes in his conference, James and Curry drafted the team rosters from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference. The captains selected their 11 teammates regardless of conference affiliation, marking the NBA\u2019s first All-Star Game without a matchup between the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Team LeBron features seven players from the East and five players from the West, with seven frontcourt players and five guards. Team Stephen showcases seven players from the West and five players from the East, with seven guards and five frontcourt players. The five players in the 2018 NBA All-Star Game who have won the Kia NBA All-Star MVP \u2013 Davis (2017), Durant (2012), Irving (2014), James (2006, 2008) and Westbrook (2015, 2016) \u2013 are all on Team LeBron. Durant will go head-to-head against the Warriors\u2019 other three All-Stars in Curry, Green and Thompson.  During the draft, the eight remaining All-Star Game starters (aside from James and Curry) were selected in the first round. The 14 reserves were chosen in the second round. James, as the top overall finisher in fan voting, was awarded the first pick in the first round, while Curry had the first pick of the second round. The captains alternated picks in each round until all players in that round had been selected. With Curry representing the Western Conference in a Western Conference arena, Team Stephen has been designated the home team and was able to choose between wearing black or white uniforms. Curry selected the black uniforms, and Team LeBron was assigned the white uniforms as the visiting team. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, choosing a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Silver\u2019s selection would join the team that drafted the replaced player. If a replaced player is a starter, the head coach of that team will choose a new starter.  Team LeBron will be coached by the head coach from the Eastern Conference team with the best record through games played on Sunday, Feb. 4 among the 14 teams with an eligible head coach.

Durant accused referee James Williams of targeting him for an ejection during Tuesday\u2019s game against the New York Knicks. Durant was ejected from the game with 2 minutes, 50 seconds by Williams. A day later, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 star took a moment to reflect on his words and apologized to Williams . Durant said he was behaving like a \u2018jerk\u2019 and said he plans to say sorry in person the next time he sees Williams and vowed to handle himself more respectfully next time. In a tweet today from the NBRA\u2019s account, the organization said Durant\u2019s apology is accepted. \u201cApology accepted. This is the kind of common ground we hope to achieve when the NBRA meets with @TheNBPA next month,\u201d the tweet read. \u201cI wish I had handled that better obviously but it was kind of a heat-of-the-moment for me. I could be better. It was a great learning experience for me though,\u201d Durant said after Wednesday\u2019s practice. \u201c\u2026 I wasn\u2019t getting picked on last night. I was being a diva last night. I\u2019ve got to just own up to it. I watched it when I got home. I was wondering why he was coming at me so hard but then I watched the plays I was like, `Yeah, I looked like a jerk out there.\u2019 It was bad. Luckily we won and we can move past it and I kind of owned up to it. I\u2019ll be better next time.\u201d Throughout the 2017-18 season, tension between officials and players have been high. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this month in London that the NBPA and NBA referees are planning to meet at All-Star weekend to discuss issues between them. Additionally, Silver said he is listening to complaints from both sides. \u201cI\u2019m listening to the players\u2019 complaints, and I\u2019m also listening to the referees\u2019 complaints,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say although it seems to be getting a fair amount of attention, we\u2019ve looked back at the data from over the years and there haven\u2019t been a greater number of ejections or a greater number of technicals. \u201cThere is nothing aberrational happening in terms of the calls on the floor, but it\u2019s something that people are talking about.

There\u2019s a positive change. Targeted by some teammates during a heated meeting this week, Love is returning to power forward after Cavs coach Tyronn Lue tweaked his lineup in hopes of reviving a team that has dropped 10 of 13 games. Lue had been resisting changes, but following Thursday\u2019s practice he announced he\u2019s dropping forward Jae Crowder to the second team, returning center Tristan Thompson to the starting lineup and switching Love, who was named an All-Star reserve, back to a position where he is much more comfortable. LeBron James and his teammates have been consumed in recent days by chaos, highlighted by a pre-practice meeting Monday when players aired grievances. A few targeted their frustration at Love, who went home sick from Saturday\u2019s lopsided loss to Oklahoma City and missed Sunday\u2019s practice. Lue said he considered other changes, but decided the Crowder-Thompson-Love maneuver is it for the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good time right now,\u201d Lue said. \u201cJust see how this works first and go from there.\u201d Cleveland\u2019s season is crumbling with every loss, and Lue had little choice but to do something to slow the decay. He had several other options, like benching either point guard Isaiah Thomas or struggling shooter J.R. Smith, but Lue felt the move with Crowder made most sense. Lue said Crowder, who started 43 of Cleveland\u2019s 46 games, accepted the demotion without pushback. \u201cJae has been playing good the last few games and it has nothing to do with Jae,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe\u2019s been great. He\u2019s all about the right things. He\u2019s all about the team. You hate to make these changes. Not saying it\u2019s permanent, but he\u2019s about the team. Went and talked to him this morning and he said, `Whatever is best for the team. I\u2019m all in.\u2019 It was a great talk with him.\u201d Lue believes Thompson\u2019s defensive ability will help when opponents run pick-and-rolls on the undersized Thomas, who is still finding his rhythm after missing seven months with a hip injury. On the offensive end, Thompson\u2019s screens might free up Thomas as well. When Lue informed Love of the switch, the five-time All-Star said, \u201cgood.\u201d It\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened in days for Love, who has spent much of his four seasons in Cleveland under attack. While he struggles on the defensive end against bigger players, Love is a matchup nightmare for defenses because of his ability to play with his back to the basket and outside range. He willingly moved to center this season for Lue, who appears to be done with his \u201csmall-ball\u201d lineup. \u201cHe felt good about it and I think offensively for him now he can post more 4s,\u201d Lue said. \u201cGet back to posting him more. I think it\u2019s a good adjustment for us. Just have to see how it looks going forward.\u201d While they\u2019ve made an on-floor adjustment to improve, the Cavs have unresolved issues away from the court. Thompson said the team\u2019s fractured relationships may not heal. \u201cThat\u2019s part of life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day when we\u2019re between these lines, we got to play for one another and that\u2019s all that matters. I don\u2019t care if X don\u2019t like X off the court. \u2026 As long as you\u2019re on the court playing hard and playing for each other, that\u2019s all that matters to me. We don\u2019t got to talk to each other off the court. As long as we talk on the court, on the defensive end, that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d The Cavs have been at each other\u2019s throats before. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work our habits though. It\u2019s not going to be as easy as we\u2019d all like it to be. But at the end of the day, nothing has ever come easy to me, so I actually like what we are. I don\u2019t like losing, I don\u2019t like the way we\u2019ve been losing. But I think it\u2019s going to help us out in the long run.\u201d"},{"id":42143,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2017-18-kia-rookie-ladder-week-15","date":"2018-01-25","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Ben Simmons making triple-double waves, reclaims top spot","content":"In the Week 15 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Rookie Ladder , we check in on the five rookies who are making the biggest impact so far this season. * Previous Kia Rookie Ladders:  Debut edition | Week 12 | Week 13 | Week 14"},{"id":42150,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-westbrook-takes-it-inside-arc","date":"2018-01-25","title":"One Team, One Stat: Russell Westbrook opts to take it inside arc","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Wizards vs. Thunder (8 ET) The Oklahoma City Thunder are starting to look like the team we thought they\u2019d be. After an 8-12 start to the season that had them ranking 21st offensively through November , the Thunder have gone 19-8 since Dec. 1, vastly improved offensively and still a top-10 team on defense. There have been some hiccups along the way, but the Thunder have climbed from ninth to fifth place in the Western Conference, and are just two games in the loss column behind the third-place San Antonio Spurs . Entering Thursday, the Thunder have a five-game winning streak and are on the brink of being one of four teams that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They can get there by continuing their recent offensive surge ( 123 points scored per 100 possessions over their last three games ) when they host the Washington Wizards tonight in the first game of TNT\u2019s double-header. Here are some numbers to know about the Thunder through 47 games \u2026 Pace : 98.0 (21st) OffRtg : 106.4 (11th) DefRtg : 102.8 (5th) NetRtg : +3.5 (7th) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders Over his last 22 games, Westbrook has taken 11 percent of his shots from 3-point range . That rate ranks 48th among 51 guards who have attempted at least 200 shots since Dec. 11, higher than only those of Ben Simmons (1 percent), Ish Smith (6 percent) and Elfrid Payton (11 percent), and less than half the rate of Ricky Rubio (29 percent). Westbrook wasn\u2019t nearly as reticent to shoot 3-pointers through the Thunder\u2019s first 25 games. Through Dec. 9, Westbrook had taken 29 percent of his shots from 3-point range , a rate in line with the one he registered last season (30 percent) . With the game within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, Westbrook\u2019s shot selection was more heavy on 3-pointers. Through those first 25 games, 21 (45 percent) of his 47 clutch shots came from 3-point range. But he was shooting just 31 percent from beyond the arc , a mark which ranked 72nd among 81 players who had attempted at least 100 3-pointers through Dec. 9 . And on those clutch 3-pointers, he was 4-for-21 (19 percent) . Game 25 was an overtime win over Memphis on Dec. 9 in which Westbrook hit the game-winning free throws after drawing a foul on a drive to the basket . Prior to that, he shot 1-for-12 from beyond the arc, including 0-for-4 in the clutch . And at some point in the next 48 hours, Westbrook clearly made a conscious decision to shoot fewer 3-pointers. Against Charlotte on Dec. 11 , Westbrook took only two of his 22 shots from 3-point range. The trend continued, with three or fewer 3-point attempts in nine of his next 10 games. Over the last three seasons, Westbrook has had just 17 games in which he attempted one or zero 3-pointers, and eight of the 17 have come in the last six weeks. Three is greater than two and a player can generally increase his effective field goal percentage by shooting less from inside the arc and more from beyond it. Even when Westbrook was shooting 31 percent from 3-point range, those shots were worth a lot more (0.9 points per attempt) than his *mid-range shots (0.6), on which he was shooting 30 percent through Dec. 9 . * Mid-range = Between the paint and the 3-point line. But after that 1-for-12 performance from deep, Westbrook started shooting more from mid-range. He made just two of 13 mid-range attempts in the next two games , but started shooting better after that. And the shot selection change has worked out. Over the last 22 games, Westbrook has shot 48 percent , up from 39 percent over those first 25 . And the difference has been almost completely from mid-range. Since Dec. 11, Westbrook has scored 42 more points from mid-range than any other player and his 46 percent on mid-range shots ranks 11th among 28 players who have attempted at least 75 in that timeframe . He also leads the league in points scored in the restricted area since Dec. 11 . Westbrook\u2019s shot chart late in close games has changed as well. Only 14 (29 percent) of his 48 clutch shots since Dec. 11 have been 3-point attempts. His game-winner against Brooklyn on Tuesday was a drive to the basket . Some of his mid-range shots have actually been off the catch. As you\u2019d expect, the vast majority of Westbrook\u2019s 2-point jumpers are off the dribble, but he\u2019s 9-for-15 on catch-and-shoot 2-point jumpers since Dec. 11 after attempting just three prior to that . His effective field goal percentage of 50.1 percent over the last 22 games is still below the league average. Westbrook\u2019s free throw rate has actually dropped over that time, even though he has taken a greater percentage of his shots at the basket. And his career-low free throw percentage ( 71 percent, down from 82 percent over the first nine years of his career ) has his true shooting percentage at just 51.2 percent, also below the league average and his lowest mark since his second season in the league . But it\u2019s been climbing since he changed his shot selection, and the Thunder offense has improved with its point guard. It didn\u2019t exactly break out on Dec. 11, but the Thunder rank fourth offensively (111 points scored per 100 possessions) since then after ranking 24th (102) prior . 1. The Thunder have allowed just 94.3 points per 100 possessions in 549 minutes with Steven Adams, Paul George and Andre Roberson on the floor together. That\u2019s the lowest on-court DefRtg among the league\u2019s 250 most-used three-man combinations , with George, Roberson, Westbrook (95.1) ranking second and four other combinations of OKC starters in the top 12. Roberson has been the biggest key to the Thunder\u2019s defense. They\u2019ve allowed 11 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (96.6) than they have with him on the floor (107.7) . That on-off DefRtg differential ranks *fourth among 292 players who have played at least 500 minutes this season. The Thunder went 4-4 and ranked 12th defensively over an eight-game stretch (from Dec. 31 \u2013 Jan. 15) that Roberson missed with patellar tendinitis in his left knee.  * The three players with a bigger on-off DefRtg differential \u2014 Detroit\u2019s Langston Galloway (-12.8) , Dallas\u2019 Yogi Ferrell (-12.3) and Houston\u2019s Luc Mbah a Moute (-11.4) \u2014 are all reserves, typically playing more minutes against opposing reserves. George, meanwhile, leads the league (by a pretty wide margin) with 4.3 deflections per game . With George and Roberson on the floor together, Thunder opponents have committed 19.2 turnovers per 100 possessions, the highest opponent turnover ratio of the league\u2019s 250 most-used two-man combinations . And *64 percent (180\/283) of those turnovers have been live balls. * On average, just 53 percent of the league\u2019s turnovers have been live balls. The Thunder defense is in the middle of the pack in opponent effective field goal percentage (15th), defensive rebounding percentage (14th), and opponent free throw rate (17th). But OKC leads the league in opponent turnover rate , thanks to its two wings that will both deserve First Team All-Defense consideration at the end of the season. 2. Adams has 57 more offensive rebounds (216) than defensive rebounds (159). No other player that has grabbed at least 30 total rebounds this season has more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds. And since the league started tracking offensive and defensive rebounds in 1973-74, only one player has ever averaged at least 7.5 rebounds per game (Adams has averaged 8.9), with more on the offensive end than on the defensive end. That was the Nets\u2019 Jayson Williams in 1997-98, who had three more offensive boards (443) than defensive boards (440) . So Adams is on pace for maybe the most unique rebounding season ever. Adams is a force on the offensive glass. He\u2019s the reason the Thunder lead the league in offensive rebounding percentage for a third straight season, despite the departure of Enes Kanter, who led the league in offensive rebounding percentage in 2015-16 and ranked fourth last season . Adams leads the league this season at 17.3 percent , the highest mark for any player in the last three years.  If you take second chance points out of every offense in the league to determine how efficiently they score on initial possessions, the Thunder rank 18th (and below average) in that regard. But the second chances have pushed them up to 11th (and above average) in overall offensive efficiency . They would get a bigger boost if they were better at converting second chances into points. The Thunder have scored just *1.17 second chance points per offensive rebound, the second lowest rate in the league, better than only that of the Chicago Bulls (1.14). Adams ranks second in put-back field goal attempts , but 19th in put-back field goal percentage among 26 players with at least 50 attempts . * This is not a perfect metric, because it doesn\u2019t account for team offensive rebounds (when the rebound goes out of bounds off the defensive team or the defensive team commits a loose-ball foul on the rebound). On the other end of the floor, Adams has seen a drop in his defensive rebounding percentage each of the last three seasons , with Thunder bigs often allowing Westbrook to grab the ball and start the break. But the discrepancy between Adams\u2019 offensive boards and defensive boards is more about the increase on the offensive end of the floor than the decrease on defense. And throughout his career, the Thunder have been a better defensive rebounding team with him on the floor than with him off the floor . That\u2019s more important than his individual rebounding numbers. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

Kidd\u2019s abrupt and surprising dismissal Monday has taken an emotional toll on the All-Star forward, affectionately known as the \u201cGreek Freak.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of my success in the league,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after Wednesday\u2019s practice in his first public comments since the coaching change. \u201cI\u2019m loyal to the people I work with. I love him as a person. I care about him as a person.\u201d Informed by Bucks\u2019 management of the planned firing even before Kidd learned his fate, Antetokounmpo called his soon-to-be ex-coach to break the news. \u201cIt was one of the toughest calls I had to make,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to miss him.\u201d Joe Prunty, a member of Kidd\u2019s staff, has been named interim coach for the remainder of the season. He directed the team to a 109-105 win over Phoenix on Monday, just hours after taking over the team. Kidd became Milwaukee\u2019s coach a few months after a group led by co-owners Wes Edens and Mark Lasry bought the team in April 2014. The Bucks traded two future second-round draft picks to the Brooklyn Nets, where Kidd had been coach, as compensation. He inherited a team that won 15 games in 2013-14. Under Kidd, the Bucks had a regular-season record of 139-152. Milwaukee is 9-12 since going a season-high five games over .500 on Dec. 9. Asked whether he believed Kidd should have been fired, Antetokounmpo, who reportedly offered to go to the team\u2019s owners to try to save Kidd\u2019s job, said: \u201cIt\u2019s in the front office\u2019s hands. Whatever they can do to make this team a championship level team, it can happen. If it\u2019s me being traded, or the coach being fired.\u201d Kidd is the second coach to be fired since the Bucks selected Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick in the 2013 draft. Antetokounpmo played one season under Larry Drew, who was dismissed in June 2014. \u201cI was only 18,\u201d Antetokoummpo said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how the NBA worked. (Kidd\u2019s firing) hurts a little bit more because he was here for 3 1\/2 years. He trusted me. He put the ball in my hands. He pushed me to be great.\u201d Antetokounmpo is expected to return to action when the Bucks take on Brooklyn in Milwaukee on Friday. He sat out the past two games as he continues to manage chronic pain in his right knee. \u201cI feel great. I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel energized.\u201d Prunty said his players \u201cgave good energy\u201d in the first full practice since he took the reins. \u201cThese are a tough few days,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cWe need to focus on whether we are getting better.\u201d The Bucks have said that Prunty will be considered for the permanent job after the season. The hire will be especially crucial as the Bucks prepare to move into a new arena. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about that aspect of it right now,\u201d Prunty said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me, especially under these circumstances.\u201d Malcolm Brogdon, last season\u2019s NBA Rookie of the Year, praised Prunty\u2019s positive demeanor. \u201cIn times of struggle, we tend to pout and take our foot off the gas. We can\u2019t do that,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good coach to have when we are going through those struggles.\u201d"},{"id":47896,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2018-rising-stars-roster-announcement-official-release","date":"2018-01-24","title":"Philadelphia 76ers' Ben Simmons, Los Angeles Lakers' Lonzo Ball highlight 2018 Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars rosters","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 NBA All-Star Game starter Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers headlines the list of 20 players selected by the league\u2019s assistant coaches to play in the 2018 Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars on Friday, Feb. 16 (9 p.m. ET) at Staples Center in Los Angeles.

He is set to become the first 76ers player to start an All-Star Game since Allen Iverson in 2006. \u2022 Simmons, the Kia NBA Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for October\/November, is on pace to become the first rookie to average at least 16.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists in a season since Magic Johnson in 1979-80. \u2022 Chicago\u2019s Markkanen is the fastest to 100 career three-pointers in NBA history (41 games). \u2022 Denver\u2019s Murray was the MVP of last year\u2019s Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars, finishing with game highs of 36 points, 11 assists and nine three-pointers to lift the World Team past the U.S. Team 150-141.

The Jazz has never had a rookie lead the team in scoring for a season. \u2022 Boston\u2019s Brown (14.2 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and Tatum (13.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg), the Kia NBA Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for December, have started all season for the East-leading Celtics. \u2022 Chicago\u2019s Dunn ranks third in the NBA in steals (2.05 spg), leads all second-year players in assists (6.4 apg) and has raised his scoring average nearly 10 points from last season (3.8 ppg to 13.7). \u2022 Simmons (four), Ball (two) and Dallas\u2019 Smith (one) have combined for seven triple-doubles, which is one more than produced by rookies in the previous five seasons combined. \u2022 The World Team features five players who participated as campers in Basketball without Borders (BWB), the NBA and FIBA\u2019s global basketball development and community outreach program: Embiid (BWB Africa 2011), Markkanen (BWB Europe 2014; BWB Global 2015), Murray (BWB Global 2015), Ntilikina (BWB Europe 2015; BWB Global 2016) and Saric (BWB Europe 2010). The NBA\u2019s assistant coaches chose the rosters for the Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars, with each of the league\u2019s 30 teams submitting one ballot per coaching staff.

They also picked a minimum of three first-year NBA players and three second-year NBA players for each team. The head coaches for the Mtn Dew Kickstart Rising Stars will be the lead assistant coaches from the 2018 NBA All-Star Game coaching staffs. The All-Star coaching staffs are determined by the best record in each conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 4 among teams with eligible head coaches. Boston head coach Brad Stevens and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr are ineligible to coach in the NBA All-Star Game because they did so last year. NBA opening-night rosters for the 2017-18 season featured 108 international players from a record 42 countries and territories.

While Durant had yet to hear from the NBA on Wednesday, he said he is prepared for whatever fine he receives. He also plans to say sorry in person the next time he sees Williams and vowed to handle himself more respectfully next time. \u201cI wish I had handled that better obviously but it was kind of a heat-of-the-moment for me. I could be better. It was a great learning experience for me though,\u201d Durant said after practice. \u201c\u2026 I wasn\u2019t getting picked on last night. I was being a diva last night. I\u2019ve got to just own up to it. I watched it when I got home. I was wondering why he was coming at me so hard but then I watched the plays I was like, `Yeah, I looked like a jerk out there.\u2019 It was bad. Luckily we won and we can move past it and I kind of owned up to it. I\u2019ll be better next time.\u201d Durant had 14 points, a career-high 14 assists and two blocks before his ejection with 2:50 left in the 123-112 win , then criticized Williams publicly afterward. \u201cKevin knows he should not have said what he said after the game,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said Wednesday. \u201cBut this has been such a big topic this year. It does seem like maybe there\u2019s a little bit more relationship stuff than there used to be. I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know why that is. I know the best officials to me are the ones who will talk to me and I also know they deserve my respect. And I\u2019ve snapped a couple times this year and said some things that I shouldn\u2019t have. So it\u2019s a matter of trying to maintain composure and dignity and you still have to be able to complain about a call and the ref needs to be able to accept that he\u2019s wrong sometimes.\u201d Durant said he initially became upset with Williams for a carry call in the first half on a left-to-right crossover move Durant has put so much time into perfecting that \u201cit irritated me.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t react like that,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI wish I could apologize to James because that was definitely out of my character.\u201d Durant said once he watched the plays that earned him the technicals, he saw he behaved inappropriately.

What say you?  * * * David Aldridge :  I say he\u2019s wrong. But, it\u2019s much closer than it\u2019s been in a long, long time, and the Rockets should be confident after beating Golden State twice already this year. Steve Aschburner : I say \u201cProve it.\u201d Not on a random night in the middle of the season, when teams are navigating disparate schedules, travel, injuries and more, but when it counts in the postseason. It\u2019s nice that Capela believes so in his team \u2014 you can\u2019t beat somebody if you genuflect at their every mention \u2014 but saying it and showing it are dramatically different things. Shaun Powell :  I say he should wait until the Rockets actually beat the Warriors in a meaningful game \u2014 none of which will take place until late spring \u2014 before issuing bold statements. Have some respect \u2014 the Warriors didn\u2019t reach the last three championship rounds by accident, and they still have their nucleus intact and in its prime. And last I looked, the major players around Capela haven\u2019t won squat. That would be Mike D\u2019Antoni, Chris Paul and James Harden. Notice that none of them said anything. John Schuhmann :  I appreciate Mr. Capela\u2019s confidence in his team, though I question him disclosing that opinion on the record. The Rockets are a better team than any that the Warriors faced on the way to last year\u2019s championship, but the Warriors are still the better team, because of their ability to play at an elite level on both ends of the floor. The Rockets did well to add defense and versatility last summer, but the champs still have more two-way players in their rotation.  Sekou Smith :  Talk is cheap. Whip the Warriors in the playoffs and then I\u2019ll listen to E.F. Capela. Right now, he\u2019s just blowing smoke like so many guys around the league like to do these days. There\u2019s no question the Rockets did the job in the regular-season series, sending the message that they intend to do everything in their power to keep the Warriors from making a fourth straight appearance in The Finals. And we should expect nothing less from a team with James Harden and Chris Paul leading the way and Mike D\u2019Antoni at the controls. That said, I wouldn\u2019t put any more stock in one of them saying the exact same things Capela said. Let your play do the talking come playoff time and then we\u2019ll see who is ready for prime time and who is not. * * * * * *"},{"id":42167,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-state-milwaukee-bucks-season-after-firing-jason-kidd","date":"2018-01-24","title":"Blogtable: What does Jason Kidd's firing mean for Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 season?","content":" * * * Milwaukee has fired coach Jason Kidd . What does this mean for the Bucks right now, this season?  * * * David Aldridge :  Really, not a lot. I know and like Joe Prunty and he\u2019s a terrific coach, but the issues facing the Bucks are structural, not just coach-based. Maybe they\u2019ll be a little less frantic with the halfcourt traps, but will that lead to more deflections and runouts and transition opportunities that were the mother\u2019s milk of Milwaukee\u2019s great defense a couple of years ago? Will it make them a better shooting team? The Bucks are looking for rebounding via trade, and until they get an inhaler of stray shots they\u2019re going to continue to operate in fits and starts offensively. Steve Aschburner : Firing Kidd means the Bucks can \u2014 in fact, had better \u2014 get serious about the legitimate expectations with which they came into this season. That is, a top-four seed and advancing into the Eastern Conference semifinals. Those goals got blurred as Milwaukee slid to the No. 8 spot and the coach seemed oddly unaffected by that. If Kidd was trying to motivate his players with a little reverse psychology, he should have focused some analysis on ways he could have helped them more. How much the Bucks accomplish this spring likely will hinge more on Jabari Parker\u2019s comeback than tweaks to the defense and rotations with Kidd gone. But there was time left to change some things up and Milwaukee needed to try. Shaun Powell :  No major shakeup is necessary until we see this team with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Malcolm Brogdon and Jabari Parker on the floor together for a substantial amount of time. And that may not happen until next month at the earliest, after the trade deadline. Once the Bucks reach the offseason and find a coach, then they can take stock of their needs prior to the Draft and free agency and create a clearer blueprint. This is a solid group that, for some reason, didn\u2019t relate well with Jason Kidd. Maybe they will with the next coach. They deserve that chance. Giannis isn\u2019t getting old. Yet. John Schuhmann :  Among East playoff teams, only the Cavs have been worse defensively than the Bucks, who rank 24th on that end of the floor . Improvement could come with a more conservative scheme that will do a better job of protecting the basket and avoiding fouls. No team has allowed its opponents to take a higher percentage of their shots in the restricted area, and only one team (Memphis) has a higher opponent free throw rate . The two most efficient ways to score in this league are at the line and at the basket, the Bucks haven\u2019t done a good enough job of keeping their opponents away from those two places, and they need to be better, especially given their collective length. And hopefully, they\u2019ll no longer be fouling intentionally when up four or missing free throws intentionally when up three.  Sekou Smith :  It means someone other than Kidd gets to work under what I think are unrealistic expectations for a Bucks team that, while talented, is not close to being the elite playoff outfit some in the organization believe them to be. It also means the Bucks, like so many teams before them, will operate with expectations like they have already arrived, when their performance under Kidd suggested they clearly had not. So it was all on Kidd? I\u2019m not buying that. A new coach, better yet the right new coach, can change the trajectory. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s going to happen as quickly as needed to satisfy the powers that be in Milwaukee. I\u2019ve heard some people compare this situation to what the Golden State Warriors did when they fired Mark Jackson and ultimately replaced him with Steve Kerr.

Name a player who didn\u2019t make the cut who totally deserves a spot in next month\u2019s game?  * * * David Aldridge :  Lou Williams. Those aren\u2019t empty numbers ( 23.3 points per game, 40.5 percent on 3-pointers ) he\u2019s putting up this season; despite all the injuries and two-way contracts and opponents trying to get in the locker room, the LA Clippers are right on the edge of the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Williams is the main reason. All due respect to Draymond Green, who\u2019s a vital player for the Warriors, but the new Sweet Lou ( Hudson; Google him ) should be on his home court at Staples next month. Steve Aschburner : Lou Williams. Normally Williams would be a non-factor for the All-Star Game, given his niche role as offense off the bench. But he has been pressed into heavy duty for the Clippers, starting 14 games and averaging a career-high 32.2 minutes. At 23.3 points and 40.5 percent shooting from the arc, this was the 31-year-old Williams\u2019 best (only?) chance to snag an All-Star berth. I wouldn\u2019t bump anyone from the West reserves to fit in Williams, but if each squad had a 13th spot, he\u2019d be my pick for one. Shaun Powell :  I thought for the most part the right players made the cut. You could quibble here and there, but if I must choose, then it\u2019s Tobias Harris of the Detroit Pistons. Perhaps instead of Kevin Love, or maybe Kristaps Porzingis, neither of whom has been as consistent since opening night like Harris, who\u2019s having a breakout-like year. Two more things: I don\u2019t care much about Andre Drummond or Dwight Howard not getting in, or that the Miami Heat got shut out (there\u2019s no singular star there). Also, I want my All-Star teams stocked with entertaining players because it\u2019s an exhibition game. The All-NBA teams are for merit, and besides, those teams are more important anyway \u2014 and much tougher to make. John Schuhmann :  In the East especially, the resume of any other player in the conversation (as well as that of a couple of the players who were selected) is flawed in one way or another. In the West, the Paul George vs. Damian Lillard vs. Lou Williams conversation is fascinating. George has been the best defender on the best team of the three. But the other two guys have scored more efficiently in bigger roles on offense. Lillard\u2019s role is a little bigger than that of Williams, but Williams\u2019 team has been better offensively . I can\u2019t fault the coaches for putting Lillard in the game and we should really have 13-man All-Star rosters, though an additional spot would still leave one of those three guys feeling left out.  Sekou Smith :  For the first time in years I don\u2019t find myself to be outraged about a player or two being left out of the mix for the All-Star Game. It\u2019s rare that I walk away from the process feeling like the fans (players and media, too,) got it right on the starters and the league\u2019s coaches nailed it on the reserves. The one guy I think should be a little salty right now is Paul George , who has played well this season alongside Russell Westbrook, and shown himself to be worthy of the two-way player elite tag he earned as an Indiana Pacer. If I were a cynic, I\u2019d swear there was some backlash against George based on how he departed Indiana. But I can\u2019t identify a player from the Western Conference I could justify removing to make room for George. Sometimes there just aren\u2019t enough spots for all of the players deserving of All-Star honors. * * * * * *"},{"id":42173,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/donovan-mitchell-surprising-himself-and-utah-jazz-during-rookie-campaign","date":"2018-01-24","title":"League taking note of Donovan Mitchell's impressive rookie campaign","content":" The biggest rebound in Utah Jazz history, one that\u2019s more timely than any yanked down by Hall of Famer Karl Malone , is Gordon Hayward walking out their door and Donovan Mitchell walking in. The Jazz knew what they lost last summer when Hayward wrote his Dear John letter (aka The Players\u2019 Tribune) and fled to Boston via free agency into the open arms of his former coach at Butler, Brad Stevens. In 2016-17, he was Utah\u2019s lead singer, their leading scorer in the fourth quarter , an All-Star and someone who sent Salt Lake City kids  and fans running to the barber for flip-over Hayward buzz cuts. His leaving for Boston was made more painful when you consider Hayward was drafted and carefully developed by the Jazz , groomed for big things \u2026 and then all the hard work and patience went poof. But that angst lasted only about three months, or roughly when the Jazz began to feel the excitement and the hope again, all of which was all generated by a rookie. His impression on Jazz fans began in the Utah and Las Vegas Summer Leagues , carried over into training camp and the start of the season. It\u2019s quite obvious now, here in January, with enough evidence already laid: In basketball-speak, Mitchell\u2019s got next in Utah. \u201cYou could see the tools early on,\u201d said Jazz coach Quin Snyder. \u201cDonovan\u2019s teammates accepted him right away. We all did.\u201d He is the unique rookie who arrives on a scene that\u2019s heavy with veteran players, yet earns respect quickly, becomes the primary option, gets the ball when the game is tense and leads the club in scoring (19.2 points per game \u2014 first among rookies) . He was drafted as a two-guard, yet he also spends a fair amount of time at the point despite the presence of veteran pass-happy guard Ricky Rubio. Everything about him is still being developed. Meanwhile, Mitchell shows enough shooting range, passing instincts and dunkaholic tendencies to hint of possible future stardom. If he keeps the pace this season, he\u2019ll be deep in the Kia Rookie of the Year conversation . From there, who knows? While the Jazz had an inkling about him in Summer League when he scored 37 points in one game and was strong throughout, the person most surprised by all this is Mitchell. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any of this coming,\u201d Mitchell said. Less than two months into his NBA career he dropped 41 points on the New Orleans Pelicans , the first rookie to crack 40 since Blake Griffin in 2011. It also surpassed the 38 points Jazz legend Darrell Griffith put up in his rookie season in 1980-81. He was the Rookie of the Month for December and last week notched his 19th game of 20 or more points , one better than Malone\u2019s Jazz rookie record set in 1985-86. But those numbers don\u2019t explain the poise and the confidence, which are far more useful signs that Utah might be onto something with Mitchell. \u201cHe\u2019s learning how to be a leader, has a lot of confidence and is always working hard,\u201d said Jazz center Rudy Gobert. \u201cI think he\u2019s been very good overall. He\u2019s not scared of the moment, not scared of big shots, not scared to attack. Pretty rare for a rookie.\u201d Mitchell was wise enough to sense an opening and after losing Hayward, the Jazz lacked a proven scorer. A veteran-laden roster like Utah\u2019s might cause the typical rookie to proceed gingerly and not disrupt chemistry or cause issues. Rodney Hood was the presumed next man up, but he has struggled with injuries and inconsistency. While he and Mitchell take roughly the same amount of shots, Mitchell is more efficient ( 44.6 percent to Hood\u2019s 41.3 percent ). Mitchell can also play two positions and gets his number called more often by Snyder when Utah needs a bucket. \u201cHe\u2019s assuming a role in clutch situations, and it makes sense,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense in trying to pretend. He\u2019s the most capable player and so I\u2019m not concerned if he\u2019s 19 or 25 or a rookie. There\u2019s no reason to wait. If they\u2019re capable of doing it, do it. The way he is and the kind of person he is, nobody on the team envies him.\u201d Mitchell is unconventional by NBA standards. He grew up middle class and went to school in Greenwich, Conn., one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country, through junior high before going the prep school route partly because of athletics. Mitchell had to play AAU ball in the New York City leagues to find better competition than the Connecticut suburbs. His father is in baseball operations with the New York Mets and Mitchell played the sport before abandoning it when his basketball skills became evident. He was coached at Louisville by Rick Pitino, a former NBA coach, and didn\u2019t leave until after his sophomore year \u2014 unlike most lottery picks. His background made him eloquent and intelligent, which is evident when you speak to him. This maturity helped him with Jazz teammates, who rave about his composure and say he seems a lot older than he is. Strange, but it\u2019s possible that Mitchell\u2019s development wouldn\u2019t be where it is now had Hayward re-signed with the Jazz. \u201cProbably not, in certain areas,\u201d said Snyder. \u201cWhen you have a guy like Gordon, there\u2019s going to be times when you\u2019re running stuff for Gordon. I think Donovan would be doing some of the same things, but he wouldn\u2019t have the usage rate. That\u2019s logical. Now, in this situation without Gordon, we just wanted to give him more responsibility, and he kept taking it from there. It\u2019s like, when someone\u2019s finished eating, you put more food on his plate. Then more. He\u2019s been pretty hungry.\u201d With heavy minutes ( a team-leading 31.7 per game ) and role for a rookie, Mitchell is able to play through his mistakes, learn from being in almost every game situation and get experience that\u2019s helping him now and in the future. \u201cOne of the things we can see in Donovan that\u2019s unique is his aptitude,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI saw him make a good left to right spin move this summer, and later add a Euro-step, a floater, a scoop layup this season. With players at his age, it takes time. But he\u2019s been able to accelerate the learning process because of his ability. \u201cThe biggest thing is the emphasis on the decisions. We want him to take good shots and as long as he\u2019s focused on that, he\u2019s able to draw attention and find people. He plays with a pure heart. It\u2019s unusual to have a rookie as a catalyst and when that happens, a player could take liberties with that. The responsibilities that I\u2019ve given him, often times you could take it for granted. He doesn\u2019t. He tries to make the right play.\u201d Eventually, the Jazz must decide his true position. Mitchell stands 6-foot-3 and seems like a combo guard. In a best-case scenario, he plays more off the ball and the Jazz find their point guard of the future this summer via the Draft, a trade or free agency. The wild card is Dante Exum, the former future point guard who\u2019s out for the season and hasn\u2019t played in two of the last three seasons because of injury. He will be a restricted free agent this summer, so does Utah re-sign him or look elsewhere? Overall, though, the Jazz must be pinching themselves over Mitchell, a good get by GM Dennis Lindsey and player personnel man Walt Perrin. Losing Hayward last summer was devastating for the franchise. Utah often doesn\u2019t have it easy when it comes to acquiring talent. An A-list free agent has never chosen the Jazz as a destination, which conjures up all the old images of Utah being a tough sell for young players looking for big city lifestyle and advantages. Malone, John Stockton and Deron Williams, like Hayward, Gobert and now Mitchell, all came from the Draft. Williams played his way out of town, Gobert is signed (for now) and Hayward is gone. The heartbreaking part about losing Hayward is the investment of time the Jazz spent developing him. While it\u2019s far too early for them to worry about that happening with Mitchell \u2014 and Gobert at least for the next three years \u2014 it is always lurking in the background for Utah. The good news, for now: Mitchell looks special enough to be placed in that company. \u201cI know I\u2019ve got a lot more to learn, so I\u2019m just taking it game by game,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to look at this as a regular situation, not to make too much of it, just go out and make the right plays. The fact they trust me is awesome but with that trust it\u2019s about making the right decisions. It\u2019s being able to find guys, not always trying to get to the basket, staying hungry, don\u2019t get comfortable. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a long season and hopefully a long career.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

After last night\u2019s 104-101 road loss to the Denver Nuggets , the Blazers are 25-22 and in the No. 7 spot in the Western Conference . Portland is also just five games behind the Minnesota Timberwolves for the Northwest Division lead. However, the Blazers have not won more than three games in a row at any point this season \u2014 and have not lost more than five in a row at any point, either. They are one of the league\u2019s better defensive teams ( 104.2 Defensive Rating, which is 7th in NBA ) \u2026 but are middle of the pack on offense ( 104.5 Offensive Rating ) and pace ( 98.87 ) and they don\u2019t take a lot of 3-pointers ( 26.1 per game, 23rd in NBA ). They\u2019re 13-14 against the rest of the Western Conference and 3-5 against Northwest foes, all of which adds up to an inconsistent season for Portland. ESPN.com\u2019s Chris Haynes reports that star guard Damian Lillard \u2014 who is in the midst of an All-Star season ( 25.2 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 6.6 apg ) \u2014 met with team owner Paul Allen to discuss the direction of the team. The talk, Haynes reports, took place last Thursday before the Blazers\u2019 home game against the Indiana Pacers that was the first home game Allen had attended in 2018. Most of the discussion centered on Lillard sharing with Allen his desire to stay with the Blazers and also for the team to put a championship-contending team around him : Lillard and Allen also reportedly discussed potential players to target in trades, Haynes reports. The two also discussed the 2015 trade of guard Will Barton that netted Alonzo Gee and Arron Afflalo \u2014 neither of whom are still with the Blazers. Lillard, along with All-Star starters LeBron James, James Harden and Stephen Curry, is one of four players averaging more than 25 points, four rebounds and six assists this season .

All-Star team rosters will be unveiled on Thursday, Jan. 25 at 7 p.m. ET in a special one-hour edition of TNT NBA Tip-Off presented by Autotrader . Curry and James will select the team rosters without regard for conference affiliation. Each captain will choose 11 players to complete a 12-man roster. The 2018 NBA All-Star Draft rules are as follows: The starters, announced last week , were selected by a combination of fans, current NBA players and a media panel. The East starter pool is James, Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks), DeMar DeRozan (Toronto), Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) and Kyrie Irving (Boston). The West starter pool is Curry, DeMarcus Cousins (New Orleans Pelicans), Anthony Davis (New Orleans), Kevin Durant (Golden State) and James Harden (Houston Rockets). The 14 reserves were chosen by the NBA\u2019s 30 head coaches. The coaches voted for seven players in their respective conferences \u2013 two guards, three frontcourt players and two additional players at either position group. They were not permitted to vote for players from their own team. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, choosing a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Silver\u2019s selection would join the team that drafted the replaced player. If a replaced player is a starter, the head coach of that team will choose a new starter.  Team LeBron will be coached by the head coach from the Eastern Conference team with the best record through games played on Sunday, Feb. 4 among the 14 teams with an eligible head coach.

Towns joins a seasoned group of All-Stars from the West, led by San Antonio\u2019s LaMarcus Aldridge, his Timberwolves teammate Jimmy Butler, Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard and Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook. The starters from both the Eastern and Western Conferences were announced last week . Captain and leading overall vote-getter LeBron James headlines the East, with Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving, Toronto\u2019s DeMar DeRozan, Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid rounding out the group. Fellow captain Stephen Curry led the vote-getters from the Western Conference and is joined as a starter from the West by his Golden State Warriors teammate Kevin Durant, Houston\u2019s James Harden and New Orleans teammates Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. James has first pick in the All-Star Draft , which is being held Wednesday, the results of which will be revealed Thursday during a one-hour edition of TNT NBA Tip-Off at 7 p.m. ET. In addition, the Nike uniforms worn by Team LeBron and Team Stephen will also be revealed on TNT. James has first pick from the pool of eight starters while Curry will go first when picking from the pool of 14 reserves. Porzingis kicked off his season with a bang, averaging 30 points through the first 10 games of the season and is posting career bests in points (23.3), blocks (2.3) and 3-point shooting (.387) in just his third season. Oladipo has been arguably the biggest surprise of the season, going from a role player last season in Oklahoma City to a bona fide star in his first season with the Pacers. He\u2019s managed career-highs in points (24.2) and rebounds (5.2) in addition to shooting it better by far (.484 from the floor, .402 from deep) than he has in his previous four seasons. Beal, who missed the cut last season, finally joins Wall on the All-Star team in his sixth season. He leads the Wizards in scoring (23.6) and is also averaging career-highs in rebounds (4.3) and assists (3.7). Those East rookie All-Star reserves join a group that owns a combined 19 All-Star appearances among them. Horford, a five-time All-Star, has been a rock for a Celtics team that sits atop the Eastern Conference standings and has for weeks during a season that saw them lose prized free agent acquisition Gordon Hayward for the season just minutes into the season opener. Love, also making his fifth All-Star appearance, is playing out of position at center and leading the Cavaliers in rebounds while shooting 40 percent from beyond the 3-point line. Lowry earned his fourth straight All-Star nod, teaming with DeRozan in the backcourt for a Raptors team with a revamped offense that is just two games behind the Celtics in the Eastern Conference standings. Wall, making his fifth straight All-Star appearance, has been limited to 36 games due to injury but is still averaging 19.3 points and 9.2 assists for a Wizards team that sits fifth in the East playoff chase. Towns is a franchise pillar for a Timberwolves team that has surged to third in the Western Conference standings behind the one-two punch that he and Butler, a four-time All-Star, have provided. Towns is shooting the best he ever has from deep (.412), while still averaging a double-double (20 points, 12.1 rebounds) for a third straight season. Butler, meanwhile, has been every bit as good as advertised in his first season being reunited with Tom Thibodeau after an offseason trade from Chicago. The other five reserves from the Western Conference have piled up a combined 23 All-Star appearances. Aldridge has been the anchor in San Antonio with Kawhi Leonard\u2019s season plagued by injuries. The six-time All-Star leads the Spurs in points, rebounds and blocks and is the only player on the roster playing more than 27.5 minutes (33.9). Green is making his third All-Star appearance and Thompson his fourth straight, as the other two stars from a Warriors team that becomes the first in league history to have four All-Stars (the same four) in back-to-back seasons. Lillard, a three-time All-Star, is back for the first time since 2015. One of the league\u2019s most dynamic floor leaders, he\u2019s leading the Trail Blazers in points (25.2) and assists (6.6). Westbrook, who is making his fourth straight All-Star appearance and seventh overall, has seen his scoring average dip from last year\u2019s triple-double effort with the offseason additions of (former) All-Stars Paul George and Camelo Anthony. But he\u2019s still close to that triple-double level this season (24.8 points, 10.1 assists and 9.7 rebounds). Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

There was a much-publicized team meeting held the other day in which players singled out power forward Kevin Love for him leaving Saturday\u2019s blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder early and for him missing the next day\u2019s practice . Cavs coach Tyronn Lue has maintained that a lineup change is not in order for the team after the team was searching for answers after that loss to OKC. After today\u2019s practice in San Antonio, Lue made it clear that for all the chatter and team meetings the Cavs have had of late, the only thing that will matter is if his team starts winning again. ESPN.com\u2019s Dave McMenamin was on hand for Lue\u2019s comments as well as some from Love, who said he wasn\u2019t the only target of ire at Monday\u2019s meeting : Lue said he did not need to defend Love\u2019s absence in Saturday\u2019s blowout, which, according to Cleveland.com\u2019s Joe Vardon, was attributed to migraine symptoms . Per ESPN.com, players were both skeptical of Love\u2019s sickness and critical of the team\u2019s coaching staff and decision-makers for allowing Love to leave without any accountability. As for All-Star forward LeBron James, he refused to address the team meeting topic and instead turned the spotlight on how his play simply has not helped Cleveland win. The Cavaliers have been mentioned in some trades of late and according to ESPN.com, GM Koby Altman is continuing to work through potential deals. Pulling off a trade may require the Cavs to part with the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 unprotected pick in the 2018 Draft, writes TNT\u2019s David Aldridge .

An NBA playoff run culminating with a championship. And a game to remember that made NBA history. All those things were a part of Klay Thompson\u2019s 2014-15 NBA season, one in which he averaged a then-career-best 27.1 points per game on 46.3 percent shooting and a 43.9 percent mark on 3-pointers. His play all season \u2014 and that of Kia MVP Stephen Curry, too \u2014 ultimately helped Golden State to its first title in 40 years . * Box Score:  Warriors 126, Kings 101 On Jan. 23, 2015, though, it was all about Thompson. He would ultimately finish with 52 points in the Warriors\u2019 126-101 home win against the Sacramento Kings. A performance like that would garner attention on its own, but Thompson took things a notch higher. In the third quarter, he was in a scoring zone, netting 37 points in a shooting and scoring display that had never been seen before. He set an NBA record for points in a quarter , 3-pointers in a quarter (nine) and tied a league record for field goals made in a quarter by going 13-for-13 from the field. \u201cI was one of the luckiest NBA players ever to play with Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, David Robinson and some of the greatest players ever,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAs many spectacular things as Michael did, which he did nightly, I never saw him do that.\u201d Thompson surpassed the 33-point mark set by George Gervin in 1978 and matched by Carmelo Anthony in 2008 for the most points in a quarter. Michael Redd and Joe Johnson shared the previous mark for most 3s in a quarter with eight. \u201cIt was kind of a blur. I wish I could go back and enjoy it some more, but moments like that go by really fast,\u201d Thompson said. Fittingly, Thompson wasn\u2019t even officially an All-Star yet as of this game. A day earlier, Curry received the most All-Star votes in the NBA and Kerr learned he would lead the Western Conference in the league\u2019s showcase game.

This is not news, especially after the Cavaliers gave up a whopping 148 points in Saturday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City. They are 4-10 over their last 14 games, tied for the third-worst mark in the league over that span. The rough stretch has not only dropped Cleveland into a virtual tie for third place in the East, but also created tense questions in the locker room. Some have been dismissed, including the notion that coach Tyronn Lue might be on the hot seat and that lineup changes are afoot . Kevin Love, however, is reportedly not being so easily forgiven. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the team held an \u201cemotional\u201d meeting before Monday\u2019s practice in which several Cavalier players challenged the legitimacy of the illness that forced Love to leave Saturday\u2019s game early , as well as miss Sunday\u2019s team practice. Several players were pushing for the Cavaliers\u2019 management and coaching staff to hold Love accountable for leaving the arena before the end of Saturday\u2019s game, and then missing Sunday\u2019s practice, league sources told ESPN. The meeting was loud and intense, only calming down once Love spoke to those gathered in the room and explained himself, league sources said. The meeting included Cavaliers coach Ty Lue and general manager Koby Altman, league sources said. There was a sense that the team was largely accepting of Love\u2019s explanation, and that the airing out of issues could have a positive impact on what has become an increasingly fractured locker room. Within factions of the locker room, there has been blame for the Cavaliers\u2019 struggles directed at everyone from Love to Isaiah Thomas, to Lue and the front office, led by Altman, and owner Dan Gilbert, league sources said. Love played just over three minutes in the contest, going 0-for-2 from the field while failing to make any other statistical impact. The four-time All-Star told reporters after Monday\u2019s practice that he felt dizzy during the game, but that he was now feeling better and was planning to play against San Antonio on Tuesday . . @kevinlove says he is feeling better and will play tomorrow in SA..says he felt super dizzy Sat vs OKC and had to come out of the game pic.twitter.com\/GuwE9yUdeb \u2014 Fred McLeod (@CavsFredMcLeod) January 22, 2018 The Cavaliers were counting on Love to step up this season after trading point guard Kyrie Irving to Boston last summer to Boston in exchange for Thomas, Jae Crowder and a first-round pick.

Wojnarowski added that there was some sense of closure after Love defended and explained himself on Monday, but whether long-term peace had been achieved \u201cremains to be seen.\u201d In a locker room increasingly full of finger-pointing, Love defended himself and explained his side to teammates, coaches and management, sources said.

In an interview with Rick Bonnell of The Charlotte Observer , Jordan admits that he \u201cwould listen to opportunities\u201d to trade the one-time All-Star, but added that any deal would need to net a player with equal credentials: Walker has played his entire six-year career with the Hornets, dating back to when they were formerly known as the Charlotte Bobcats. He had steadily improved multiple aspects of his game until this season. Injuries have derailed the progress of several teammates, forcing Walker to face constant defensive attention that has in turn diminished his production and efficiency.

Milwaukee, a team with aspirations of a top-4 seed in the Eastern Conference when the 2017-18 season began, lost at home for the second time in 11 days to their I-94 rival Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were 10-22 heading into that post-Christmas game, still committed to backing their way to the most draft lottery balls possible. Chicago roughed up the Bucks on the boards (15 offensive rebounds) and outscored them 93-75 over the final three quarters at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Afterward, Kidd handled the disappointment by trying to tell the world that up was down, north was south and don\u2019t believe your lying eyes. \u201cAt the end of the day we\u2019re a young team,\u201d Kidd said, \u201cand this is going to be a team that\u2019s going to go up and down and understand the growing pains of losing to a team like Chicago.\u201d Chicago? The Bulls were flexing a bit with Nikola Mirotic on board, after what had been a 3-20 start. But two defeats in less than two weeks? On the Bucks\u2019 home floor? Kidd continued: \u201cYou guys can write that we\u2019re a super team and that we\u2019re really good and we\u2019ve got the \u2018Big 3\u2019\u2026 We\u2019re a young team that\u2019s learning how to play the game at a high level with expectations that are a little bit too high.\u201d Those words were an abject denial of his and his team\u2019s reality. Kidd was in is fourth full season as Milwaukee\u2019s coach, leading a team that began 2017-18 with more roster continuity than anyone else in the league. The Bucks already had taken their baby steps under Kidd, getting introduced to the playoffs in 2015 in a feisty first-round elimination by Chicago . They backslid to 33-49 the next season , then peeked above .500 at 42-40 last year before losing to Toronto in six games . With Giannis Antetokounmpo thrusting himself into the KIA MVP spotlight in this season\u2019s early weeks \u2013 the Greek Freak is averaging 28.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 9.4 free throw attempts, while shooting 54.6 percent \u2013 the Bucks\u2019 order of business seemed clear: snag a top seed, win a playoff series and take another stride as a contender poised for LeBron James\u2019 and the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 eventual decline. Yet there was Kidd, seemingly spitting out the bit, disavowing those fairly modest goals in spite of talent (Antetokounmpo, shooter Khris Middleton, freshly acquired playmaker Eric Bledsoe), in spite of much-ballyhooed defensive length and reach, in spite of optimism over forward Jabari Parker\u2019s anticipated return from his second ACL knee surgery in three years. Coaches who get fired in the NBA and other pro sports typically have a \u201clast straw\u201d moment that triggers the move. In Kidd\u2019s case, a miserable \u201cSouth Beach disadvantage\u201d matinee loss at Miami on Jan. 14 and\/or the team\u2019s 116-94 spanking in Philadelphia Saturday might have provided that. It\u2019s even possible that there was a disagreement, an incident or some other relationship hiccup behind closed doors to precipitate the firing today. But it was Kidd\u2019s odd and unexpected reach for the reset button after the second Bulls defeat, as if trying to redefine the season\u2019s mission and buy himself or someone else time, that put him sideways with the job he no longer holds. There was plenty of smoke before the firing, of course. The Bucks were 4-7 in January heading into their game against Phoenix Monday. They were playing slower than their players\u2019 youth and skills needed, ranking 23rd in pace (97.8) in a marginal tick up from last season (26th, 96.7). Offensively, they have been only slightly better (107.0 rating vs. 106.9, year over year), while defensively they\u2019ve been noticeably worse (107.5 vs. 106.4). Kidd\u2019s penchant for dialing up his defenders\u2019 aggressiveness in trapping and swarming has backfired as opponents have devised ways to thwart the tactics. That vaunted length \u2013 less in play with Bledsoe rather than Antetokounmpo at point guard \u2013 doesn\u2019t have the Bucks near the league\u2019s leaders in blocking or contesting shots (25th in opposing field goal percentage overall, 28th in 3-point defense). Milwaukee\u2019s bench was thinned for weeks by a variety of injuries and ailments, and Parker \u2013 despite upbeat reports from his workouts and practices \u2013 is being held to a return date sometime around the All-Star break. For all the growth in Antetokounmpo\u2019s game, he still hasn\u2019t added reliable shooting range but the Bucks haven\u2019t rounded up or coached up deep threats around him, ranking near the bottom in all 3-point categories.  From the start of the Kidd era, the Bucks\u2019 lineups and rotations could change unpredictably from week to week, night to night, in head-scratching fashion. For a soon-to-be Hall of Famer considered the consummate point guard, Kidd flipped through at least six regulars at that position in 3.5 seasons: Jerryd Bayless, Brandon Knight, Michael Carter-Williams, Antetokounmpo, Malcolm Brogdon and Bledsoe. Kidd\u2019s communication skills might be better with his players than they seemed to the world, but there were many instances of individual Bucks left guessing about a DNP or a cut in minutes. On the other hand, the 23-year-old Antetokounmpo leads the NBA in minutes per game (37.4) but had to sit out Saturday against the Sixers and was out again Monday to manage soreness in his right knee that has flared up the past two seasons. Then there was Kidd\u2019s close relationship with Marc Lasry, one of the team\u2019s tri-owners, dating back to Lasry\u2019s pre-NBA incarnation as a billionaire hedge fund manager. The other two Bucks owners, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, also are \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d money guys, in a three-cornered dynamic that at various points has suggested more tension than consensus. Kidd reportedly craved formal personnel authority from the moment he got to Milwaukee. Former Bucks general manager John Hammond \u2013 who drafted Antetokounmpo, signed Greg Monroe (since traded) as the franchise\u2019s biggest free-agent get and plucked last season\u2019s Rookie of the Year, Brogdon, out of the second round \u2013 had Kidd, his ownership \u201cin\u201d and occasional rumors peering over his shoulder before jumping to Orlando last May. Kidd to GM or Kidd to POBO never happened. Quite the opposite, as it turned out. Assistant Joe Prunty was tabbed to work the sideline against the Suns and is expected to serve as interim for the rest of this season. Beyond that, with Antetokounmpo as their cornerstone, a state-of-the-art practice facility and a magnificent new arena opening next fall, GM Jon Horst and the owners should have their pick of coaching candidates eager to work in Milwaukee. Some wondered about the timing of Kidd\u2019s firing. Now vs. the end of the season? Game day vs. off day? But the most interesting aspect of the timing might be that it came on the organization\u2019s 50th \u201cbirthday,\u201d that is, the anniversary of the date in 1968 when Milwaukee (and coincidentally Phoenix) was awarded an expansion franchise. Things got real for those Bucks 14 months later when the Suns called heads, the coin came up tails and Milwaukee won the right to draft a certain lanky UCLA product with something that would be dubbed \u201cthe sky hook.\u201d Things got real for the 2017-18 Bucks and for Jason Kidd Monday, when Kidd\u2019s bosses blew out his candle. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They are just 4-7 since the calendar flipped to 2018 despite the MVP-caliber play of Antetokounmpo and midseason acquisition of point guard Eric Bledsoe. The news leaked before Kidd was even aware Milwaukee had decided to move on in a different direction. That may have played a part in Antetokounmpo telling Kidd, \u201cthis isn\u2019t right, what they\u2019re about to do.\u201d The former player and fifth-year head coach, however, apparently felt something like this would happen sooner than later, telling his star player, \u201cI had a feeling that was gonna take place.\u201d * * *"},{"id":42199,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-coach-jason-kidd-fired-report","date":"2018-01-22","title":"Milwaukee Bucks fire coach Jason Kidd","content":" MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Seeking change amid midseason struggles, the Milwaukee Bucks fired coach Jason Kidd on Monday after a slide that left a team with designs on challenging the NBA\u2019s best in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. It was a surprising end to Kidd\u2019s three-plus-season tenure in Milwaukee, during which the Bucks made the playoffs twice, exiting in the first round each time. Giannis Antetokounmpo turned into an All-Star under his watch, and the Bucks were considered an emerging force in the East at the start of the season. * Aschburner:  Slumping Bucks hit reset button in firing Kidd  But the Bucks had lost four of five to fall to 23-22 going into Monday night\u2019s game against Phoenix and had been prone to defensive lapses, especially on the perimeter. Turnovers were an issue of late as well. General manager Jon Horst, who was promoted from director of basketball operations in June, said it was time for a change. Kidd was fired hours before the Bucks beat the Suns 109-105. Assistant coach Joe Prunty will serve as interim coach for the rest of the season, co-owner Wes Edens said in an interview before the game. Under Kidd, the Bucks had a regular-season record of 139-152. \u201cA general manager in the NHL had a statement once: \u2018If something is inevitable, why wait?\u201d\u2018 Horst said at a news conference. Horst added that the decision was made \u201crelatively quickly,\u201d and was not in the works through the season. \u201cWe just felt that we got to a point in the season where this team could do more and could perform at a different level in a different way and (we are) looking for a fresh approach and different voice in leadership for the team,\u201d Horst said. Kidd was hired a few months after a group led by Edens and Mark Lasry bought the team in April 2014. The Bucks traded two future second-draft picks to the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets went 44-38 in 2013-14 in Kidd\u2019s only year in Brooklyn, losing in the second round of the playoffs to the Miami Heat. In Milwaukee, Kidd inherited a team that won 15 games in 2013-14. He was part of a fresh start for an organization that had been mired in mediocrity for years. Other than a 33-win season in 2015-16, the youthful Bucks hovered around .500 under Kidd as Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton blossomed into top-flight players. Malcolm Brogdon won the NBA Rookie of the Year award last season, and Jabari Parker has the potential to be an explosive scorer when healthy. \u201cI think Jason\u2019s done obviously a tremendous amount for the organization. He\u2019s a good friend, he\u2019s a soon-to-be Hall of Fame basketball player,\u201d Edens said. \u201cBut we think this team can be the best team in the East and we want to give ourselves every chance we can to do that. \u201cSometimes that requires change. That\u2019s the judgment that was made by Jon Horst. We the ownership are universal in support of that,\u201d he added. We believe that making this change now is important for the organization and gives our players the best chance to reach their full potential this season and beyond.\u201d Bucks GM Jon Horst Milwaukee has largely treaded water in the wide-open East even after adding talented guard Eric Bledsoe in a trade with the Suns in November. The Bucks are hoping to get Parker back in a few weeks from a left knee injury that has kept him out all season. Milwaukee is 8-12 since going a season-high five games over .500 on Dec. 9. Asked to assess the problems with the Bucks, Prunty said, \u201cWell, I think the bottom line is, we\u2019ve talked about this as a staff, is that we have been consistently inconsistent.\u201d Bledsoe said he was shocked by the firing of Kidd, whom he called a mentor. \u201cI thought he did a great job, but it\u2019s a business. You can\u2019t control it,\u201d Bledsoe said. This is an important year for the franchise, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary and getting ready for the opening of a new downtown arena next season. \u201cWe believe that making this change now is important for the organization and gives our players the best chance to reach their full potential this season and beyond,\u201d Horst said."},{"id":42196,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-james-harden-confident-team-depth-season","date":"2018-01-22","title":"James Harden on Houston Rockets: 'We are for real as it can get'","content":" The Rockets\u2019 116-108 victory Saturday against the Golden State Warriors gave them the regular-season series against the team that has Houston wants: an NBA title.

The guess here is that Koby Altman was a close second. The Nets are no threat to Altman\u2019s team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Brooklyn is well out of the playoff chase in the Eastern Conference. But Altman, the Cavs\u2019 general manager, possesses Brooklyn\u2019s unprotected first-round pick in the 2018 Draft , the untapped jewel of the trade that he had to engineer last summer when Cleveland agreed to Kyrie Irving\u2019s trade demand. So Irving went to Boston while Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, a 2020 second-rounder and the 2018 first went to Cleveland. But every Brooklyn win makes the pick, potentially, less valuable, lessening the chances of it becoming a top pick in the Lottery in May. And on that knifepoint, this morning, ride the Cavaliers, in the midst of their worst stretch of play since LeBron James\u2019s return in 2014. Saturday\u2019s humiliating loss to Oklahoma City \u2014 giving up 148 points at Quicken Loans Arena \u2014 displayed the Cavs\u2019 horrible defensive flaws to a national audience: no on-ball pressure, no communication, no footspeed, no confidence. While there\u2019s no sign that coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s job is currently in jeopardy, this latest roughest of rough patches \u2014 nine losses in the last 12 games, with two of the three wins coming against the Orlando Magic \u2014 has shook the team more than anything in recent years. Even when the Cavs were without Irving and Kevin Love in The 2015 Finals , they still thought they could beat the Golden Stae Warriors. Now, the doubt is real and growing. Cleveland is 29th in the NBA in Defensive Rating (109.8) and 26th in points allowed per game (109.5). In January alone, the Cavs are 30th in Defensive Rating (114.3), 30th in second chance points allowed per game (16.3); 27th in opponent 3-pointers made per game (12), 25th in opponent points off of turnovers (20.1). * Blogtable:  How would you fix Cavs\u2019 defensive issues? But Altman doesn\u2019t have much time to improve the roster. The trade deadline is the week before the All-Star festivities begin, Feb. 8 \u2026 less than three weeks from now. The young GM, who got the job in July after former GM David Griffin and the team agreed to part company , has a huge decision to make. Cleveland has been aggressive to improve the roster in-season since James has come back. The Cavs got Kyle Korver last January from the Atlanta Hawks for Mike Dunleavy, Mo Williams and a 2019 first-round pick. In 2016, they got Channing Frye from the Orlando Magic in a three-team deal . In 2015, they got J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert from the New York Knicks in another three-team deal that sent Dion Waiters to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and spent two future firsts to get Timofey Mozgov from the Denver Nuggets . The Cavaliers have made it clear all year that they don\u2019t want to and don\u2019t intend to the trade the Brooklyn pick (they do have their own 2018 first-round pick they could include in a deal), in part because they have no idea whether James \u2014 who can opt out of his deal and enter free agency this summer \u2014 will return next season. James hasn\u2019t given them any indication of what he\u2019s going to do, and it\u2019s possible he may not know yet. But Cleveland can\u2019t leave itself with nothing. On the other hand, you\u2019ve got Babe Ruth on your roster \u2014 maybe not Babe in his absolute prime, but still capable of mashing. Do you let him walk because you\u2019ve got a chance, maybe, of getting Bill Dickey . (And, no, there would be nothing wrong with getting Bill Dickey, himself a Hall of Famer \u2014 except if it cost you Babe Ruth.) The current consensus among many executives around the league is that Cavs owner Dan Gilbert and Altman will, ultimately, hold onto the Brooklyn pick. The likelihood of Cleveland ever getting a potential top-10 pick again in the James era is Who in Whoville size. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a player on the market that justifies it unless LeBron targets someone and makes it a condition of his return,\u201d one executive texted Sunday. But who could that be? And what else does Cleveland have that other teams would want? Smith has tailed off considerably this season. Shumpert has been hurt. Tristan Thompson has been slowed most of the season by a calf injury , and he\u2019s displayed little of the defensive ferocity he showed in the 2015 and 2016 playoffs. Love has had a terrific season, has earned James\u2019 praise and will likely be named an All-Star reserve by coaches Tuesday . But dealing him would remove the Cavs\u2019 best shooting big man from the roster. It\u2019s obvious James wouldn\u2019t be interested in a rental player if he was going to opt in or re-sign with Cleveland for 2018-19. So unless he also knew the player acquired was going to stay with the Cavs next year, trading for someone like LA Clippers center DeAndre Jordan or guard Lou Williams would be a gamble. \u201cDesperate people do desperate things,\u201d another executive said who thinks Cleveland may well move the pick. The 29-year-old Jordan is expected to opt out of the last year of his current deal this summer in search of a big, max-like payday. If Cleveland re-signs James, it would definitely be for the max, a yearly stipulation James has made clear will run through the rest of his career. That would make re-signing Jordan to a max deal extremely difficult, especially considering Thomas will also be an unrestricted free agent this summer, and is also looking for a huge deal. (Complicating matters further, Jordan now has the same agent as Love and Korver.)  Jordan does still play very good defense, but his numbers have slipped this season. How much of that is due to Chris Paul and his outstanding defense being gone, along with injuries to players like Patrick Beverley that could have helped Jordan this season, is fair to ask. Any number must be surrounded by context, the way a joey is nuzzled in a western gray\u2019s pouch . Per NBA.com\/Stats, Jordan\u2019s individual Defensive Rating of 108.6 is just 79th among players who average 30 or more minutes per game, and 12th among centers . Last season, his Defensive Rating was 103.7 , 19th-highest overall and third-best among centers . He\u2019s only blocking one shot per game this season, a block and a half fewer than his career-best 2.5 per game in 2013-14. And, per basketball-reference.com, Jordan\u2019s Defensive Win Shares have dropped to 1.9 this season, down from 5.8 in \u201913-\u201914. The Cavs have also asked about Atlanta\u2019s Kent Bazemore, according to league sources. Bazemore is no lockdown wing, but he does give effort, and he is shooting a career-best 37.6 percent this season on 3-pointers . Bazemore has more than $37 million coming to him through 2020 on his current deal, though. The Chicago Bulls will almost certainly deal Nikola Mirotic by the deadline. The Cavs haven\u2019t been linked to Mirotic, a poor defender who nonetheless is scoring at a significant clip ( 17.3 per game, including 44.7 percent on 3-pointers ). But Cleveland\u2019s bench needs a boost. Chicago has insisted on a first-rounder in return. The Mirotic-to-the-Jazz trade connection reported a couple of weeks ago is still possible, but Utah has fallen off in the Western Conference and is now four and a half games out of the last playoff spot. Rudy Gobert\u2019s return to the lineup Friday could give the Jazz the impetus to take a run at the postseason, but would that make Utah more aggressive to make a potential deal or be more inclined to keep its current group together and hope continuity and a big French shot-blocking demon could get it on a roll? James may well be more perturbed that the Cavs didn\u2019t use the remaining $4.4 million of the Traded Player Exception they had after acquiring Korver last year, and that players like Matthew Dellavdova who\u2019d gained his respect couldn\u2019t be retained. (That also includes Mozgov. He\u2019s now an afterthought in Brooklyn, he was a big part of the rotation in the first Finals season, 2014-15 .) (Cleveland also still has a $5.8 million TPE from the Irving trade that doesn\u2019t expire until August, and a $2.6 million TPE it created by trading Richard Jefferson to Atlanta which is good until October.) While James likes Derrick Rose, Rose hasn\u2019t been able to get through much of the regular season, putting even more pressure on Thomas to return as soon as possible. Yet the Cavs could say they\u2019ve done plenty to please James and his camp \u2014 getting Love from Minnesota in 2014 for Andrew Wiggins , then giving Love $110 million in 2015 ; getting Smith and Shumpert from the Knicks; giving $82 million to Thompson , who has the same agent as James, in 2015; giving $57 million in 2016 to keep Smith . They put a championship-caliber team around him, and he took that team to three straight Finals \u2014 his seventh straight Finals overall . Getting to a fourth straight Finals \u2014 and James\u2019 eighth overall \u2014 is going to take some incredible maneuvering, in short order and without much ammunition. And, perhaps, taking the remote away from Altman. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

(The All-Star reserves, chosen by coaches, will be announced on TNT on Tuesday by our \u201cPlayers Only\u201d crew.) I mean the part that everyone on NBA Earth wants to see \u2014 James, who picks first, taking \u2026 who? And having to explain why he didn\u2019t take the other guys \u2014 specifically, Kyrie Irving. Which would be followed by Curry having to do the same, and on and on, in deliciously excruciating fashion until the next-to-last All-Star is taken by James, leaving Mr. Irrelevant \u2014 the 24th and final All-Star \u2014 to go to Curry\u2019s team by default. Seriously: who wouldn\u2019t tune in to that? The league is hiding behind some \u201cunfair to the players\u201d drivel, when we all know it\u2019s the powerful agents who represent their equally powerful All-Star clients who\u2019ve whined behind the scenes, not wanting their guys to be embarrassed by not being picked first, or second, or fifth, or ninth, or not at all. To which I would have responded, too damn bad. Your guy is being paid eleventy billion dollars; he can be embarrassed for a minute, and then take it out on the captain that didn\u2019t take him by clearing out a side on the Staples Center floor on Feb. 18 and dunking on his head if he feels so strongly about it. Look, I work for Turner\/TNT. I want what\u2019s good for my company, and I understand that having exclusivity on the teams\u2019 reveal is a good thing for us. But doing it live, in real time, would be better for us. If you don\u2019t televise it, what was the point of changing the format? The change was designed to inject new life into the All-Star format; the game may have reached its nadir last year in a no-defense snoozer nobody liked. It\u2019s an exhibition game, not the Ten Commandments \u2014 change whatever you like. You want to go U.S. versus the world, like the NHL has done to spice up its All-Star Game ? Fine. But you chose this. So why not take it to its logical conclusion and make LeBron and Steph explain themselves to everyone, or to get instant reaction from the snubbed? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to be asked this at their respective news conferences on the Saturday of All-Star weekend, so we might as well get it over with. And that would be the logical extension of how the NBA has marketed itself \u2014 quite successfully, I think most would agree \u2014 the last few years. The pro game has always been about the players, not the coaches; that\u2019s college basketball, whose biggest stars are John Calipari and Mike Krzyzewski and Bill Self, not the one-and-dones who barely register in their schools\u2019 consciousness before they\u2019re off to the Association. In the NBA, the players are the show. Everything, from the in-game presentations at most arenas, to the hype videos we all show before games, to the commercials you see during the games, to the decisions teams make about trades and free agent signings, is influenced by the sway and power of the league\u2019s best players \u2014 the guys who will be on the All-Star team. The 12th man does not get a nine-figure shoe deal; the two-way player does not get the walkoff interview. That\u2019s life in the big city. The stars, the very best the NBA has to offer, are who everyone wants to see, every week. This week is no different. Can you imagine the tension if LeBron had to step to a podium, or however you want to format it, and tell the world that he\u2019s taking Kevin Durant as his first pick? Or not taking Kevin Durant with his first pick, and having to explain why? James and Curry are grown men. They can handle sticky situations. They do every day. Now, it\u2019s unlikely the league is going to have an 11th-hour change of heart. But just in case it does, or at least wants to implement this for the 2019 All-Star Game in Charlotte , what follows is a brief description of how it could pull it off with a modicum of investment, maximize eyeballs to screens, laptops, iPads and phones, and make it fun for everyone. It\u2019s an All-Star Game, folks. It\u2019s not negotiating with the North Koreans. Let\u2019s boogie: 1. Simulcast the hour-long show on ESPN and TNT , with one network\u2019s reporter embedded with James, the other\u2019s, with Curry. (Personally, I\u2019d pick Rachel Nichols from ESPN and \u2026 who? Me? No, I couldn\u2019t possibly.) 2. Each captain would have 30 seconds to make his pick. After he announces it, he would have to answer one question, as picked by the reporter: a) why did you pick KD, or b) why didn\u2019t you pick Giannis? 3. Fans would have access to an 800 number; for 50 cents per call, they could vote for the player they\u2019d like to see James or Curry take next. As each choice is revealed, one fan who correctly predicts the choice of either James or Curry in that round would be selected for a random drawing at the end of the broadcast; one of the 21 fans in the drawing (not 22, because we\u2019ll know who the last player will be after the next-to-last player is taken) would win a trip for four to All-Star Weekend. 4. Proceeds from the calls would be split evenly between the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund and the Sager Strong Foundation. 5.

From Samuel Southerland: Fair criticism, Samuel. You wrote this before Saturday, when the Cavs embarrassed themselves at home by giving up an unconscionable 148 points to Oklahoma City. Sure, Isaiah Thomas is working his way back into shape, and the Cavs have had some injuries, but what ails them doesn\u2019t seem to be explained away by Tristan Thompson or Derrick Rose being out of the rotation for long stretches. They just don\u2019t look ready to play a lot of nights, and that\u2019s almost always on the coach. There is no on-ball pressure, there is almost nothing in the way of rotations, and Cleveland\u2019s bigs got manhandled Saturday by the Thunder\u2019s Steven Adams. But veteran teams like Cleveland\u2019s also shouldn\u2019t need rah-rah speeches or mind games on the part of the coach to get themselves ready to play. Dispatches from the 901. From Steve Crain: Thank you, Steve. I have a soft spot in my heart for Memphis. I admire people who don\u2019t quit on their city, even when times are hard and the city doesn\u2019t hold up its end of the bargain. I am under no illusions about how tough things are there, and people who stay have my respect. This is why people don\u2019t listen to records anymore. From Nathan Scally: True. But winning has to factor in somewhere, to me. For example, is Devin Booker a great offensive player? Sure, of course. And if he was playing next to Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry instead of Klay Thompson, he\u2019d be getting serious All-Star consideration, and if Thompson was in Phoenix with the Suns, he wouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s a little unfair to penalize Booker for the quality of his teammates; I get that. But I bet Damian Lillard gets voted in by the coaches this year because the Blazers are a solid playoff team. The last two years, they weren\u2019t, and Lillard\u2019s candidacy suffered because of it.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (16 ppg, 2 rpg, 7.5 apg, .355 FG, .800 FT): Returned after missing the last seven games (hamstring). 2) Kevin Durant (25.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 6.7 apg, .500 FG, .955 FT): \u201c In 2026, YouTube was rebranded as DuranTV , after the former NBA superstar bought all existing channels and streams on the video sharing website\u201d. 3) LeBron James (22 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 6.3 apg, .529 FG, .480 FT): He has faced big challenges in his career \u2014 the first year of the SuperFriends in Miami was enormous, to be sure \u2014 but there have been few tests to his leadership as big as the one James faces in Cleveland now. 4) Kyrie Irving (33.5 ppg, 7 rpg, 3.5 apg, .468 FG, .867 FG): Celtics can excel without Gordon Hayward if everyone else performs at optimal levels. They almost certainly can\u2019t excel without Hayward and Irving, as Thursday\u2019s bad loss to the Sixers showed. 5) DeMar DeRozan (20.5 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.3 apg, .456 FG, .818 FT): Very cool for the Raptors\u2019 guard to be named an All-Star starter for the second year in a row \u2014 which will result in his getting to play in his native Los Angeles at Staples Center next month. 2 \u2014 Teams that have won a season series against Golden State since Steve Kerr has been coach of the Warriors. Houston became the second, joining the 2014-15 and 2016-17 Spurs, with its second win over Golden State this season, last Saturday (h\/t Matt Winer, Anchor to the Stars). 8 \u2014 Seasons, in the last 10 overall, in which the Kings have lost at least seven games in a row, a dubious distinction Sacramento has continued this year. In fact, the Kings have dropped seven straight twice this season, including their current losing streak. 323  \u2014 Days between when Dirk Nowitzki joined the 30,000-point club , and Tuesday night, when LeBron James \u2014 seven points shy as the Cavs play the Spurs Tuesday ( 8 ET, TNT ) \u2014 is almost certain to become the next member. If so, the 323 days would be the shortest period of time between 30,000-ers in league history. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hit the mark on Nov. 19, 1983. The other members? Karl Malone ( Jan. 30, 2000 ), Kobe Bryant ( Dec. 5, 2012 ), Michael Jordan ( Jan. 4, 2002 ), Wilt Chamberlain ( Feb. 16, 1972 ) and Nowitzki ( March 7, 2017 ). 1) Transparency: I was given an All-Star starters vote. Here are the players I picked. EASTERN CONFERNCE BACKCOURT: Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics; DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors EASTERN CONFERENCE FRONTCOURT: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers; Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers WESTERN CONFERENCE BACKCOURT: James Harden, Houston Rockets; Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors WESTERN CONFERENCE FRONTCOURT: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs Some thoughts: Most of these were no-brainers. The only question I had in the Eastern Conference was deciding on Embiid or Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love, who continued to thrive and put up numbers (18.6 points, 9.4 rebounds) even after having to play center most of the first half of the season in Cleveland following Tristan Thompson\u2019s injury. (No, Kristaps Porzingis was not in the discussion for me.) But I went with Embiid; the All-Star Game is the fans\u2019 game, and obviously, they want to see The Process. They voted him in as a starter, even after the 76ers stumbled badly following their strong start the first two weeks of the season. Plus, Embiid needs to be holding court with us ink- and byte-stained wretches on the players\u2019 Media Day. The West was equally easy, and also had only one tough call: Aldridge or DeMarcus Cousins. Boogie\u2019s numbers are better, but I went with Cousin LaMarcus because he\u2019s doing it without Kawhi Leonard, while Cousins is doing it with Davis. 2 ) Very smart move by the Blazers to hire former referee Don Vaden to work with the team on a formal basis. It just makes sense, in this day and age, having an ex-ref on staff and on call to help your players better understand what officials go through, what they see \u2014 and what ticks them off \u2014 is just smart. Other teams already work with former refs, and the guess here is that this will be more or less standard throughout the league in less than a couple of years. 4) Hey, I still dream I\u2019m on assignment for the Post sometimes . It happens. 1) It\u2019s the dog days of the season \u2014 the month before All-Star \u2014 and everyone is edgy and bored. I get it. But all this woofing and showing up in the other team\u2019s locker room, and throwing bones \u2014 stop. 1a) Did the league mess up the discipline for the Clippers and Rockets? Probably should have at least fined Blake Griffin for bumping into Houston Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. The NBA fined Jason Kidd, then coaching the Nets, $50K in 2013 for telling his own player, Tyshod Taylor, to intentionally bump into him and spill his drink , thus getting an unofficial timeout at the end of a game when he didn\u2019t have one. That would have been about right for Griffin \u201caccidentally\u201d running into D\u2019Antoni. As for suspending Houston\u2019s Trevor Ariza and Gerald Green two games for trying to get into the Clippers\u2019 locker room after last Monday\u2019s game in L.A., while sparing Chris Paul and James Harden for allegedly trying to be \u201cpeacemakers\u201d \u2026 well, all I can tell you is multiple people in the Clippers\u2019 organization basically backed the league\u2019s version of what happened to me, before the suspensions were announced. Paul and Harden did sit back while Ariza was more heatedly trying to get in. \u201cBlake said \u2018let \u2018em in and lock the door,\u2019 \u201d one witness recalled; another said \u201cAriza was the main instigator.\u201d The scary thing was that it took some of the Clippers\u2019 coaches, as well as security members, to calm the Rockets\u2019 guys down. What if one of the players had taken a swing at one of the coaches in a moment of anger? Maybe Paul and Harden were trying to de-escalate things. So it\u2019s not as cut and dried as \u201csuspend them all.\u201d But it\u2019s easy to understand why non-Rockets fans think the league wimped out and chose not to bench Houston\u2019s two superstars just as the Rockets had national TV games on tap. But: Houston has lots more national TV games on tap; it\u2019s not like Saturday with the Warriors is the last time we\u2019ll see them. If the league had fined or suspended Paul or Harden, they would have said, apparently correctly, \u2018wait a minute \u2014 we were trying to stop it.\u2019 2) Seven NBA players gave Indiana\u2019s Bojan Bogdanovic an All-Star vote . Nine NBA players gave Washington\u2019s Markieff Morris an All-Star vote. Five NBA players gave Sacramento\u2019s Zach Randolph an All-Star vote . Three NBA players gave Memphis\u2019 Deyonta Davis an All-Star vote. Someone gave Gerald Green, who just signed with Houston a couple of weeks ago off the street, an All-Star vote. All of the above are fine NBA players, but they would be the first to tell you they aren\u2019t All-Stars. Players often complain (sometimes, correctly) that the media doesn\u2019t know the game, and that fans don\u2019t know the game. But those arguments lose their steam when players continue to treat voting for their peers in such a cavalier manner. 3) RIP, JoJo White, one of the classiest Celtics ever, a champion at every level. How can you get a better compliment than the one former teammate Dave Cowens gave about White to the Boston Globe : \u201cHe was the guy that if you wanted somebody to shoot a free throw at the end of the game, John Havlicek didn\u2019t shoot it, it was Jo Jo.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The juxtaposition of those two buildings encompasses much of the last 50 years for African-Americans in the city, and in the country. So much is better for black people today than it was then, but so many people of color remain trapped in unemployment and poverty. It is a conundrum not lost on people like Mike Conley, who is going through one of his most frustrating years as a pro. He\u2019s only played in 12 games this season because of Achilles and heel problems , and while he\u2019s slowly working his way back toward playing again, the Grizzlies have cratered, currently well out of the playoff race in the Western Conference. But Conley, a two-time winner of the NBA\u2019s Sportsmanship Award, and who pledged $1 million last year to the Grizzlies\u2019 mentorship program, is still engaged while he waits to get back on the court.  He toured the Museum last week with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts. His annual \u201cBowl And Bash\u201d bowling tournament helps raise funds for and bring awareness to Sickle Cell Anemia, a disease prevalent in the African-American community. He\u2019s worked with the Samaritan\u2019s Feet charity to provide shoes for local kids who can\u2019t afford to buy them. Yet the week also ended with more losing for the Grizzlies, and frustration for their leader, who will have to wait at least another year before trying to, once again, earn his first All-Star Game appearance. Me: You have been in Memphis for more than a decade. You\u2019ve come out of pocket in a significant way to help the city. So as Memphis begins commemorating the passage of 50 years since Dr. King\u2019s assassination, what are you thoughts about being here and being part of a community that\u2019s trying to deal with this? Mike Conley: It\u2019s very special. It\u2019s a very special time around here. As I\u2019ve grown in my 11 seasons here, you get more and more a sense of humility, and the pride the city holds. The honor it is to be a Memphian, especially this time of year. The significance of the 50th, the big 50, it\u2019s just really an honor to be a part of this, to know that this community that I\u2019ve been a part of for so long, this community that I know has seen a lot and been through a lot, and had to deal with a lot, and to have such a historic moment happen in the city in which we call home is just a powerful moment to be a Memphian. Me: You carried Grit-n-Grind in the building for so long. Is it the same outside in the city? MC: For sure. We connect on the court, but the bond extends way beyond basketball. That\u2019s what we hold so tight and dear to us, the community work, the time we spend with these people. They\u2019re family members, honestly. They\u2019re family members. They come up to you and they don\u2019t call you by your full name; they say \u2018what\u2019s up, Mike?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s up, M.C.?\u2019 It\u2019s like you\u2019re talking to your brother. And that is the kind of connection we\u2019ve built, this organization, and it\u2019s something we stand by. Me: I wonder if you feel a special sense of community and responsibility being a person of color, knowing that a lot of people in this town who look like us in this town have it rough and they\u2019re trying to get themselves right, but it\u2019s rough out there. MC: It\u2019s very rough. And there are a lot of blacks in this city who live the life that we\u2019re trying to close the gap from, live the life where things aren\u2019t equal, things aren\u2019t fair, nothing has been given to them in their lives. And to see a team come in \u2014 a basketball team, of all sports \u2014 which has a lot of African-Americans play the game, a lot of these young people in this city have somebody to look up to. They have great role models, they have people of the same skin color they can look to and say, hey, they were able to do this and be successful, and they\u2019re in the community and giving back, trying to make an impact on our lives as well. That\u2019s the powerful thing about just having the opportunity to be in a community with a lot of African-Americans and being able to relate to them. Me: As much as you do, does it give you pause when you see the numbers about poverty and wonder, \u2018can I do any more?\u2019 MC: All the time. You look at the numbers, and they\u2019re staggering. The other night I was speaking on a panel, just about economic side of it, how so much wealth was just in a small number of people. The rest of the world is struggling. That\u2019s not Dr. King\u2019s dream. His dream is much, much more 50-50, we want to have this thing where everybody\u2019s able to live a life that\u2019s sustainable, nobody\u2019s too greedy, nobody\u2019s too wealthy. And it\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re here in this position. For me, it\u2019s one of those things where I know I can\u2019t fix it all, but I know I can start something in my community to help and try to do small things, whether it\u2019s through mentoring, building homes, education, different areas where you can try to steer people in the right direction and help them have a better path to success. Me: I know this year is killing you for a lot of reasons. MC: You see my hair is growing all the way out. That\u2019s how I feel inside. It\u2019s crazy. Me: How do you balance \u2018I need to be out there\u2019 with \u2018I need to be healthy\u2019? MC: It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do in my career. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been battling since day one of this season, trying to figure out the balance of push through this wall or just wait behind it, let everything just come together and let things settle down. But in the process of letting things play out, we didn\u2019t do well as a team. For me personally, I might have been healing a little bit better, but I\u2019m looking out there and I\u2019m feeling, I need to be out there to help this team play and move forward. Because I feel a big responsibility for what\u2019s going on now. It\u2019s hard for me to watch basketball outside of Grizzlies games. I\u2019ve lost something from this. It\u2019s really frustrating just to sit and watch. Me: The enjoyment\u2019s gone? MC: It\u2019s completely gone. I can\u2019t even watch the other games, the big Christmas games, stuff I used to do all the time, \u2018cause I\u2019m just so locked into our team and things like that. But if I\u2019m not out there I\u2019m just completely unhappy about everything else. Me: So you don\u2019t want to hear about, \u2018well, we\u2019ll get a good Draft pick out of this?\u2019 MC: No, man. \u2018Cause that\u2019s not, that wasn\u2019t our goal coming in. Whatever happens the rest of the year happens, and in the summertime we\u2019ll deal with that. It\u2019s just been a nightmare season to say the least from that standpoint. My cousin told me the other day, maybe it\u2019s a blessing. You miss a good chunk of the season, and maybe it\u2019s saving you for something else. Take some mileage off of you. \u2014 LeBron James ( @KingJames ), Thursday, 10:34 p.m., after going 7 of 16 from the floor, including 0-for-4 on threes, and 2-for-8 from the foul line, as Cleveland blew a 23-point lead before barely holding on to beat lowly Orlando at home. \u201cI put my heart and soul into this team and this city. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do until everything is over.\u201d \u2014 Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker , to local reporters on Friday , after ESPN reported that Charlotte was now willing to include Walker in potential trades for the first time in his career. Walker, the Hornets\u2019 first-round pick in 2011 and an All-Star for the first time last year, is currently second on the franchise\u2019s all-time scoring list behind Dell Curry, and second in assists behind Muggsy Bogues. \u201cI really feel like I should be in this year. I think the previous two years, we weren\u2019t in the playoffs, so that was the excuse. Well, we are in the playoffs, and I think I\u2019ve played at a high level. And I feel like it\u2019s not even close that\u2019s it\u2019s been my best defensive year. So at this point, what is the excuse? There\u2019s no excuse. I should be there.\u201d \u2014 Portland guard Damian Lillard , to local reporters , on his chances of being named an All-Star game reserve this season. Lillard was an All-Star in 2013-14 and 2014-15, the second time as an injury replacement for the Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin. \u201cI know there\u2019s been rumors about Boston trying to trade for him or whatever, and my response to that is, yeah, we\u2019ll trade him.

Parker seems to have taken the news in stride, vowing to take Murray under his wing. \u201c(Pop) told me he thought it was time, and I was like, \u2018No problem.\u2019 ,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like Manu (Ginobili), just like Pau (Gasol), you know that day is going to come. I will support Pop\u2019s decision, and I will try to help DJ as best as I can and try to be the best I can in that second unit with Manu and Patty (Mills).\u201d Age, injuries and mileage have all piled up for Parker in his 17th NBA season, in which he\u2019s averaging career-lows in scoring (8.0 ppg), assists (4.0) and minutes (21.7). He suffered a ruptured left quadriceps tendon during Game 2 of the 2017 Western Conference semifinals that ended his playoff run and spent months recovering from the injury. Parker returned to the Spurs\u2019 lineup on Nov. 27 and started 21 straight games before last night\u2019s move to a reserve role. Per ESPN.com\u2019s Michael C. Wright, Parker admitted to \u201chitting a wall\u201d recently and said he has about another two months before he will be fully confident in the status of his leg. \u201cIt\u2019s getting there. I just have to keep working on it, and just be patient,\u201d Parker added. \u201c[Cavaliers guard] Isaiah Thomas, he talked about that. When you first come back you have the adrenaline. I had all the energy, and the first 10 games I was feeling great. Then I hit that wall. Because for seven months you\u2019re working so hard on your rehab to try to come back, and you have the adrenaline, and you have the juice. The last seven or eight games, I felt like I was hitting a wall because I worked so hard to come back fast. At the same time I was hitting the wall, I twisted my ankle. So, I felt like it was just bad timing with everything. But at the end of the day, you have to find a way to produce, and I have confidence in myself. I was talking to my doctor, and he told me that\u2019s normal that you\u2019re going to hit the wall. It\u2019s at 10 or 11 months that you\u2019re really, really back. They always say the second year, you\u2019ll play even better than the first year back. So that\u2019s why I have to be patient.\u201d Spurs swingman Danny Green told reporters he learned about Popovich\u2019s decision before the game, but wasn\u2019t told why. \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade, it\u2019s above my head,\u201d Green said. \u201cAt the start, it was different. But I think Dejounte did a great job of coming in and pushing the pace. I think that\u2019s what they wanted him to do [with] working Tony in with the pick-and-roll game. But Dejounte gets it up the floor. He\u2019s kind of the road runner. So, we\u2019re using him efficiently with obviously matchups defensively; his long arms, his athleticism and rebounding. And offensively, just pushing the pace and trying to give us more movement. I don\u2019t know, I just had to guess. But you\u2019d have to ask big boss.\u201d Sunday\u2019s 94-86 loss to the Pacers marked just the 14th time in 1,165 career games that Parker came off the bench. * * *"},{"id":42228,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-loss-miami-heat-steve-clifford","date":"2018-01-21","title":"Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford questions team's effort after loss to Miami Heat","content":" * Recap: Heat 106, Hornets 105 There\u2019s a difference between having headaches and getting headaches.

A big German and Spaniard returning to the top five? Well, anything is possible, right? Notes: Season statistics are through games of Jan. 18 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (33), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 24.0 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 6.3 apg Season stats: 27.0 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 8.7 apg What is going on in Cleveland? James failed to eclipse 20 points in two of his six games. To put that in perspective, he had been held under 20 just six times in the previous 38 games. If we dig deeper, James has secured just two double-doubles in the last nine games after notching eight in the previous 11. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s had to make room at the top. 1a. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 25.8 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 1.5 apg Season stats: 22.7 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 1.9 apg Aldridge is again playing like an All-Star, going for 30 or more points in three of his last six games while failing to break 20 just once. He\u2019s also shot better than 50 percent from the field in five of the last six while chipping in at least one block in six straight. A few more 30-point performances and Aldridge will have the top spot all to himself. 3. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 23.3 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 9.2 apg Season stats: 18.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 9.1 apg Paul ascends over Gasol and into the top three on the strength of Wednesday\u2019s 37-point, 11-assist effort and five more games of 19 or more points. He\u2019s also managed to connect on three or more 3-pointers in six of the last seven and two or more steals in four of the last six. Talk about filling up the boxscore. 4. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 4 games, 19.3 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 4.5 apg Season stats: 18.4 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.0 apg Over his last six games, Gasol has shot 50 percent or better from the field just once. On a positive note, he\u2019s managed to turn in three double-doubles over that same span. But the lack of stellar performances (just one game of 25 or more points in last 12) has resulted in Gasol getting bumped from the top three. 5. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 14.7 ppg, 14.0 rpg, 1.0 apg Season stats: 15.5 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.4 apg The good: Howard has managed six consecutive games of 10 or more rebounds, with three of those being 15 or more. The bad: He\u2019s gone for 20 or more points just once in the last six (21 on Monday). The ugly: He\u2019s shot just 44 percent from the free-throw line over the last six (22-for-50). 6. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 17.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 0.8 apg Season stats: 17.6 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.5 apg The shooting continues to be an issue (39.8 FG% over last two weeks and 42.0 FG% for season), but at least he\u2019s accepting his new role with the Thunder and having fun again. On another note, Anthony managed in three home pages to average 22 points, six rebounds and 49.0 FG% compared to 12 points, five rebounds and 29.8 FG% in three road games. 7. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 19.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 17.3 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 3.3 apg After this week, it could be a while before we see Redick on our list. That\u2019s because he\u2019s expected to miss about two weeks with a leg injury. But before the injury, he was playing some solid ball, shooting 54.5 FG%, 43.5 3PT%, scoring 15 or more in eight straight while hitting three or more 3s in four of the last six. 8. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 13.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 12.0 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 1.4 apg The drought is over. After 11 straight games without a double-double, Gibson went for 16 and 13 on Monday. Of course he hasn\u2019t managed another one since \u2014 a span of five games. But during this two-week period, he\u2019s shot a blistering 58.8 from the field and chipping in 15 or more in four. 9. Trevor Ariza (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 13.6 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 12.4 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.7 apg If not for Wednesday\u2019s ugly performance (zero points on 0-for-6 shooting), Ariza would\u2019ve probably climbed at least another spot. That\u2019s impressive considering he shot just 36.7 from the field. But what helps is when you shoot a respectable 39.0 from deep \u2014 hitting four or more treys in three of five games. 10. Jarrett Jack (33), New York Knicks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 11.7 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 7.1 apg Season stats: 7.9 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 6.1 apg Jack joins the fun for the first time this season. We realize he finished poor, combining for six points on 3-for-10 shooting in the last two games, but his four games before that were impressive. In addition to a 22-point outing on Sunday against the Pelicans, Jack secured a triple-double on Wednesday against the Bulls. Just missed the cut: Zach Randolph, Dirk Nowitzki, Marcin Gortat, Pau Gasol Will turn 32 this season: Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Superstars, All-Star teammates and yes, even Kia MVP candidates. Four of the All-Star starters from the Western Conference , revealed Thursday, are teammates; captain Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant from Golden State and big men Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins from New Orleans. And if not for an offseason trade, two All-Starters from the Eastern Conference, captain and Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James and Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving, might have joined the double-up party. Given the different position designations and the All-Star format , it\u2019s not uncommon to see pairs of teammates on All-Star teams. That\u2019s obviously been going on forever. But it is certainly unique to see them in pairs in the MVP conversation, as they are in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, where Durant and Curry come in at No. 1 and No. 3, Davis and Cousins make the top 15 and All-Star starter James Harden (No. 2) and Chris Paul do the same. How in the world can two teammates both be in the top five or even in the mix for a most valuable player award? How could they not given the proliferation of \u201csuper teams\u201d in recent years? \u201cWould they be in that mix if they were doing the same things on different teams? I think so,\u201d an Eastern Conference executive said. \u201cI think attitudes have changed in that regard with the way these guys have joined forces. I\u2019m pretty sure KD and Russell [Westbrook] were both legitimate MVP guys when they played together, the same ways guys like Kobe [Bryant] and Shaquille O\u2019Neal would have been in their primes when they played together. It\u2019s not like this is something we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Maybe not. But it does upset the conventional sensibilities of some who think that there can be only one MVP on a given team, therefore making it hard to wrap their mind around two guys on one team sharing the burden we\u2019ve traditionally assigned to the single best player on a team. Durant and Curry put that argument in a chokehold with their performances this season. Durant, the reigning Finals MVP, is a dominant player on both ends of the floor and undeniably one of the most dynamic players in the game, the league leader in offensive rating who also ranks in the top five in points and blocks . That\u2019s been on full display in the games the Warriors have played this season without Curry in the mix. Meanwhile Curry, the two-time Kia MVP, elevates the Warriors to another galaxy offensively, checking in with the NBA\u2019s top real plus-minus figure . Curry\u2019s offensive rating would rank ahead of Durant\u2019s and he\u2019d be two spot ahead of him on the scoring list, if he had\u2019t missed 15 games with injuries that have kept him from playing in the 70 percent of his team\u2019s games needed to qualify for the official league leaders. Sometimes \u2026 they simply come in pairs. * * * * * * The top five in the Week 14 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists Durant led Western Conference frontcourt players in the fan vote for next month\u2019s All-Star Game and will join Stephen Curry in the starting unit for one of the two teams, to be chosen next week by captains LeBron James and Curry. LeBron has the first pick in the newly formatted All-Star player draft and would be wise to select Durant, whose ability to thrive alongside whatever elite talent surrounds him has been on full display this season for the Warriors. Even with his 3-point stroke abandoning him in a win over Chicago Wednesday, he was 0-for-5 from deep, Durant still left his mark on the Bulls with 19 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. That effort came on the heels of a 32-point, eight-assist, five-rebound, three-steal,one-block performance in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He\u2019s shooting .586 from the floor, .500 from beyond the 3-point line, and averaging 28.4 points in his past five games. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  31.7 points, 9.0 assists, 4.9 rebounds Harden looked rusty, as expected, Thursday night against Minnesota, but that didn\u2019t stop the M-V-P chants from the Toyota Center crowd glad to have their All-Star starting point guard back in the mix. It was Harden\u2019s first game back after a seven-game injury (hamstring) absence. And he\u2019s returning at the perfect time for the Rockets, who went 4-3 without him in the lineup. Saturday night\u2019s game against the Golden State Warriors at Toyota Center pits the top two teams in the Western Conference standings against one another and should produce some serious fireworks from both sides. As well as the Rockets played without him, there\u2019s no question that they are a completely different monster with Harden at his best. The Warriors know that better than anyone, after what Harden and the Rockets did to them on opening night at Oracle Arena. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.7 points, 6.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds Curry and his Splash Brothers partner Klay Thompson gave everyone a reminder of how quickly the best shooting backcourt in league history can turn a competitive game into a rout. He scored 30 points (10-for-18 from the floor, 6-for-11 from deep) and Thompson 38 in the Warriors\u2019 comeback win over the Bulls in Chicago Wednesday night. He followed that up Thursday by earning a captain\u2019s spot as one of the top two vote-getters in the All-Star balloting opposite LeBron James, becoming the first Warriors player to be named a an All-Star starter in five consecutive seasons. The real challenge, however, comes Saturday night in Houston, where James Harden and Chris Paul will certainly be waiting to welcome the Splash Brothers to town in a showdown to see whose backcourt is most explosive on this night. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  25.2 points, 5.0 assists, 4.1 rebounds The Raptors\u2019 all-time leading scorer will start in the All-Star Game for the second straight season. He makes the team for the third straight season and for the fourth time overall in his career. The starting nod is well deserved. DeRozan is having an outstanding season in Dwane Casey\u2019s new offense and is working on a 10-game stretch that has seen him average 28.8 point, 5.6 assists and 3.2 rebounds for a team that is 7-3 during that span. DeRozan played one of his best games of the season in Saturday\u2019s home loss to the Golden State Warriors, finishing with 42 points (17-for-31 from the floor and 8-for-10 from the free throw line) while missing all four of his shots from beyond the 3-point line. The Raptors could use another effort like that tonight when the San Antonio Spurs show up at Air Canada Centre for their annual visit (7 ET, League Pass). Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  24.1 points, 5.0 assists, 3.6 rebounds Outside of his former teammate, LeBron James, Irving is the most seasoned All-Star among the starters from the Eastern Conference. He\u2019s making his fifth All-Star appearance in seven seasons and has already earned All-Star MVP hardware (2014). The real drama will come in the player draft that LeBron, who has the first pick, and Stephen Curry will conduct. We won\u2019t know the result until next week, but the basketball world will be on edge until then wondering if LeBron will choose Irving to join his team in Los Angeles next month. The Celtics are surely happy with their acquisition of Irving, who sat out Thursday\u2019s loss to Philadelphia with a sore shoulder. Losers of both of their games since returning from last week\u2019s win over the Sixers in London, the Celtics still have a cushion of two and a half games over Toronto for the top spot due to the work Irving and his crew have put in throughout the course of this season. The next five: 6. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 8. Russel Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 9. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 10. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs And five more \u2026:  Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Chris Paul, Houston Rockets An inside look at Lou Williams from a Western Conference scout: \u201cHe\u2019s always been a guy who can get buckets with the best of them. There\u2019s no doubt about that. And I don\u2019t know what it is about the Clippers, Doc Rivers and his system and that sixth-man role that just works for guys like Jamal Crawford and Lou, but it\u2019s an ideal spot for a player capable of scoring the way they do. Everywhere he\u2019s been he\u2019s always done the same thing, so this run he\u2019s been on with the Clippers really isn\u2019t shocking. What makes him so effective is that he doesn\u2019t need sets to get going. He can come in cold and take advantage of you defensively because he can score from all over. He\u2019s shooting what, 42 percent from (beyond the 3-point line) and scoring 30 a night and a averaging six (5.8) assists in their games this month. That\u2019s big time in our league, I don\u2019t care if you come off the bench or start. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talking about him being an All-Star for what he\u2019s done for them and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s outside of the realm of possibility for the coaches to recognize and reward him for that. They\u2019re not in the playoff mix right now if not for the way he\u2019s stepped up and played for them and carried that scoring load the way he has. I know it\u2019s not common for a bench guy to get that kind of recognition when there are starters who have to carry a much heavier load on their respective teams. It would be a nice story to see a veteran guy who has put in the time and accepted his role the way he has and really run with it the way he has, make the All-Star team. But I think he\u2019s earned that consideration with his play more than anything. Think about it, here\u2019s a guy 13 years in, having the best year of his career, averaging career highs in points and assists and shooting it better from deep than he ever has, that\u2019s pretty damn sweet.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

In a sense, then, the Pelicans are taking a cue from New Orleans by daring to do what others won\u2019t or can\u2019t: Create a contender by using two bigs in a league that\u2019s going small? Surround them with the right mix of talent? And here\u2019s the kicker: Stick to the plan by keeping Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins \u2014 Boogie and \u2018Brow \u2014 together for the long haul? Let\u2019s address that last issue first, since it seems to be a point of contention. Apparently, the basketball world \u2014 rival teams and GMs and media mainly \u2014 believe the Pelicans are unfit for Davis and that it\u2019s in their best interest to trade him. Forget for a minute that he\u2019s under contract for at least two more years (therefore, no urgency yet) and that he loves New Orleans and has expressed nothing but confidence (at least publicly) in the plan. By constantly banging that drum beat, the noise suggests Davis, at 24, is wasting his prime years in an organization that assembled an average collection of help for him and Cousins and will be on the doorstep of salary cap hell once Cousins is re-signed this summer. And that\u2019s assuming Cousins wants to return. At this point, the team and Davis seem weary of it all, with coach Alvin Gentry saying on the team\u2019s recent visit to Boston that they\u2019ll trade Davis to the Celtics \u201cfor the New England Patriots\u201d and Davis merely laughing when the subject was raised for the gazillionth time. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to me,\u201d he said. Standing a few feet away at the next locker, Rajon Rondo interjected and said it would be a huge mistake to send Davis or Cousins on their way. \u201cThey can be the two best bigs who ever played on the same team,\u201d Rondo said. It\u2019s not like the Trade Davis Now movement is totally unfounded. He\u2019s played only four playoff games in his career, and only one series , and could be the league\u2019s best player with a losing record for his career. There\u2019s the perception of instability floating above the Pelicans, with Gentry\u2019s job status a constant source of NBA water-cooler debate along with that of GM Dell Demps. His teammates, outside of Cousins and maybe Jrue Holiday, aren\u2019t particularly impressive or impactful. And the Pelicans could get a reasonably nice haul for him, especially from the Celtics, who are stocked with young players and potentially high draft picks as bait. But: There\u2019s nothing forcing the Pelicans\u2019 hand, and Davis isn\u2019t applying any pressure. Besides, they appear committed to keeping Davis and Cousins, who were both named All-Star starters on Thursday , together like red beans and rice. That\u2019ll come at a steep cost. Cousins will command a salary in the range of $30 million a season starting in 2018-19. New Orleans gave Holiday, a good guard paid like a superstar, roughly $26 million a season last summer and Davis could be eligible for the \u201csuper max\u201d when his current deal can be renegotiated in two summers. Imagine: Three players making $85-$90 million a season, a hefty slice of the cap. That\u2019s understandable if you\u2019re the Warriors or a team with a realistic shot at going deep into the playoffs or a franchise as profitable as the Knicks. But the Pelicans are currently fighting for one of the last three or four playoff spots in the West. How will the small-market Pelicans, also stuck with poisonous contracts given to Solomon Hill and Omer Asik at least until 2020, add more talent without drunk-stumbling into luxury tax land? In that scenario, their best and perhaps only hope is to nail their draft picks and pray that cheap young talent is good enough to contribute right away. Even then, does Demps, with a spotty record as GM, inspire enough confidence in ownership to pull those triggers? All are questions and issues with some degree of validity. At the moment, however, the Pelicans are trying to comprehend why they can beat the best team in the East (the Celtics) one night and then blow a 19-point lead and lose to the worst (the Hawks) the next. Davis went from scoring 48 and 45 to getting only eight points, and Cousins was sloppy against the Hawks , which only serves to magnify how much they mean to each other and the Pelicans\u2019 chances of winning on any given night. When they\u2019re struggling, and on the same night which rarely happens, New Orleans is roadkill. They\u2019ve been together now for almost a calendar year and endured an initial rough patch last spring soon after Cousins arrived from Sacramento, to now, where the Pelicans are a respectable 23-21 on the season. The great pairing is starting to fulfill all the hopes from a chemistry standpoint. Cousins is averaging almost 26 points and 13 rebounds while Davis is 26 and 10. This isn\u2019t a 1-2 punch; it\u2019s 1A and 1B. They complement each other through friendship (those Kentucky Wildcat roots run deep), mutual respect and similar styles of play that don\u2019t clash. Cousins said there was never any question in his mind that they\u2019d be a match made in hoop heaven. \u201cOur relationship is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be good friends when you\u2019re on separate teams, and it only gets better when you\u2019re on the same team. We stay on the same page. We\u2019re good.\u201d The Boogie-\u2018Brow bond is why the Pelicans believe Cousins won\u2019t bolt this summer through free agency. Well, that, and the fact he\u2019d be leaving around $40 million on the table if he did. The goal is to cause matchup hell for the other team and this is starting to occur on a nightly basis. With the game drifting away from the big man in the NBA, and fewer 7-footers serving as the engines for their teams, Cousins and Davis are putting pressure on front lines everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for teams to switch smaller guys on \u2018AD\u2019 and DeMarcus because they can play inside or out,\u201d said Gentry. \u201cWe\u2019re built a little bit different. We can play at a fast pace because they can rebound and push it and they\u2019re good passers. Or we can play at a slow pace.\u201d The uniqueness of the Pelicans\u2019 approach, and how it contrasts with virtually every other team in the league, puts them at certain advantages, Gentry said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to dictate how we play. We may be going against the grain in the league but it gives us the best opportunity to win. We play the way we play. We like our two big guys on the floor as much as we can have them. AD is capable of guarding any stretch player people want to put out there. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to adjust to a team and say, \u2018oh, we\u2019re going to take one of them out because they\u2019re playing with a stretch player.\u2019 Our feeling is they got to guard us on the other end of the floor, too.\u201d Davis said: \u201cWe\u2019re two guys who can handle, pass and command the double team (Rondo interjection: \u201c Triple team! \u201d ) . We complement each other. We space the floor, one guy\u2019s inside and the other is outside, set screens and even run the pick and roll or pick and pop. It\u2019s tough for bigs to play against that. Most \u2018four\u2019 and \u2018fives\u2019 aren\u2019t used to that.\u201d Cousins and Davis shoot almost three times as many threes as their next-closest teammate and make a respectable 35 percent, and their range sets them apart from other celebrated twin bigs. David Robinson and Tim Duncan didn\u2019t have that, nor did Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson, but of course those were different times, when the NBA teams didn\u2019t emphasize (or want) their seven-footers standing 25 feet from the rim. Their ability to shoot threes is an advantage because it opens passing lanes and the floor, but also can work against Cousins and Davis because it negates their height advantage. When they\u2019re standing beyond the three-point arc, suddenly they\u2019re 6-2. For example, Cousins spent a good portion of the Hawks game on the perimeter, which perhaps came as a relief to an Atlanta team that lacks a strong paint presence (Dewayne Dedmon, Mike Muscala). In that sense, by staying away from the rim where he could shoot layups, gobble offensive rebounds and draw fouls, Cousins played right into the Hawks\u2019 shivering hands. There\u2019s also the issue that\u2019s beyond their control: Help. Holiday has picked up his game lately, and Rondo does well in limited minutes. Otherwise, the Pelicans aren\u2019t getting much, especially at the swing positions. E\u2019Twuan Moore is inconsistent and Hill isn\u2019t expected to make his season debut until February from a torn hamstring. Cousins and Davis are also lacking the important ingredient of winning experience. Cousins has never made the playoffs and Davis is confined to being on the wrong end of a sweep, courtesy of the Warriors. That\u2019s one reason the Pelicans signed Rondo, to serve as a mentor. \u201cOnce I signed up I told them I probably will be your most constructive critic and teammate you\u2019ve ever played with because I see the potential,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cI want to push these guys as much as possible. I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ve been pushed by teammates in the past, but my expectations for them are extremely high.\u201d One name that comes up in conversation is Kevin Garnett, a personal favorite whom Rondo uses as an example. \u201cHis mindset going into the game set him apart,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cHe never took any possessions off. The most unselfish guy I ever played with. I try to give these guys what I was passed down from my great veterans. I\u2019m here to give them knowledge and help them anyway possible, whatever they may need. I\u2019ve had a lot of great minds around me so everything I\u2019ve received, I\u2019m sharing. \u201cLook,\u201d Rondo said, \u201cfor these two guys, it\u2019s just a matter of getting to the promised land and getting over the hump. The only thing keeping them back is championships.\u201d There\u2019s a road to be traveled before Davis, Cousins and the Pelicans can think about titles. And think of the potential potholes: Cousins refusing to re-sign, the Pelicans blow a draft decision or two, a front office and\/or coaching shakeup, a roster that doesn\u2019t produce and finally, Davis gets frustrated and asks for a meeting. For now, the plan is to keep going against the trend and out-big the competition with Davis rising to an MVP level (lately, anyway) and Cousins being a top-five center once again and the Pelicans playing their way into playoff contention. Because winning will silence the Trade Davis Now protests that are raging outside of New Orleans. For now, anyway. Ultimately, with this much talent between their franchise players, this bold experiment and size advantage must deliver better results than what the Pelicans have shown so far since Davis arrived. We\u2019ll soon see if keeping Davis and Cousins together translates into a Big Improvement or ends up being a Big Miss.

Now it\u2019s time for LeBron James and Stephen Curry to continue their rivalry and go to work as the captains responsible for choosing sides for the 67th All-Star Game . As the respective ballot winners from the Eastern and Western Conferences, James and Curry will be charged with drafting the players who will compete in the Feb. 18 showcase to be played at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. James was the leading vote getter from the Eastern Conference. Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving, Toronto\u2019s DeMar DeRozan, Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid and Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo were also chosen as starters from the East. Curry was the leading vote getter from the Western Conference. His Golden State Warriors teammate Kevin Durant, Houston\u2019s James Harden and New Orleans teammates Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins were also chosen as starters from the West. The starters, voted in by fans, players and a media panel, were revealed Thursday. James has the first pick in the draft as the leading vote getter overall, while Curry has first choice of jersey color, due to the Western Conference having home team status for the game. They\u2019ll choose from a player pool that includes the eight other starters, with no regard to conference designation, and 14 reserves (seven from each conference), chosen by NBA head coaches. The reserves will be revealed exclusively by TNT\u2019s Players Only crew Jan. 23 at 7 p.m. ET.  The newly formatted team rosters will be revealed Jan. 25 during a one-hour edition of TNT NBA Tip-Off at 7 p.m. ET. Adding extra drama to the proceedings is the potential for some interesting pairings on the All-Star rosters, with friends, foes, rivals and stars from opposite sides of the conference divide joining forces in the All-Star Game for the first time. The possibilities are endless, with current teammates Curry and Durant and Davis and Cousins possibly ending up on opposing sides as starters, while former teammates could potentially be reunited depending on how the draft plays out. James and Irving played together in Cleveland for three seasons before a summer trade request ultimately sent Irving to Boston and shook up the order of things between the two teams that played in the Eastern Conference finals last season. As always, elite scorers were rewarded in the starting group, with seven of the league\u2019s top 10 scorers \u2014 Harden, Antetokounmpo, James, Davis, Durant, Cousins and DeRozan \u2014 making the cut. A player needs to play in 70 percent of his team\u2019s games to qualify for official league leaders. Curry (27.7 points) would rank third in scoring if he plays in the Warriors\u2019 next four games and maintains his scoring average. Notably absent from the starting group is reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook, despite the six-time Oklahoma City Thunder All-Star and two-time All-Star Game MVP averaging a near triple-double (24.8 points, 9.9 rebonds and 9.8 assists) for the second consecutive season.

Now in his 15th season, James needs 41 points to become the seventh NBA player \u2014 and youngest \u2014 to reach 30,000 career points, a mark he couldn\u2019t have fathomed when he began his career. James is on the verge of joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928), Kobe Bryant (33,643), Michael Jordan (32,292), Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) and Dirk Nowitzki (30,808) on the select list of scorers. \u201cI\u2019m joining elite company,\u201d James said Thursday as the Cavaliers prepared to host the Orlando Magic. \u201cWhen I walk into the 30,000-point club they\u2019re going to look at me like, \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 I ain\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d James, who turned 33 on Dec. 30, will surpass Bryant as the fastest player to hit 30,000. Bryant was 34 years and 104 days old when he hit the mark. But as he approaches more history, James isn\u2019t in any rush. While 41 points is reachable for him in any game, James would prefer to join the 30,000-point club on Saturday when the Cavs host the Oklahoma City Thunder. \u201cHopefully I don\u2019t do it tonight because my kids got school tomorrow,\u201d James said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll wait (until) Saturday. They can come to the weekend games. So, that would be pretty cool.\u201d James\u2019 two sons, Bronny, 13, and Bryce, 10, typically attend weekend home games.

It\u2019s a select company. So it\u2019s special in that right. \u201cBut I can honestly sit here and say that I\u2019ve never set out to set scoring records or be a part of a scoring club.\u201d"},{"id":42260,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-minnesota-timberwolves-efficient-without-efficient-shots","date":"2018-01-18","title":"One Team, One Stat: Minnesota Timberwolves efficient without many efficient shots","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Wolves vs. Rockets (9:30 ET) The Minnesota Timberwolves are halfway toward ending a 13-year playoff drought (the second longest in NBA history). The usual suspects hold the top three spots in the Western Conference, and the Wolves are just a game behind the San Antonio Spurs for third. The Jimmy Butler trade, made on Draft day last June , has paid off. Butler has been a Kia MVP candidate, lifting his team on both ends of the floor. The Wolves have been the league\u2019s most improved team in regard to winning percentage and its second most improved team in regard to pace-adjusted point differential ( 5.1 points per 100 possessions better than they were last season ). They rank in the top seven in regard to improvement in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They\u2019ve been picking up quality wins, too. Though the Wolves are 6-11 against the Eastern Conference after losing in Orlando on Tuesday, they\u2019re 23-6 against the West, including 13-3 against the other eight West teams with winning records. The Wolves rank 19th defensively overall , but rank seventh over their last 20 games and 12th against the league\u2019s top-10 offenses. They\u2019ll face another one on Thursday, when they visit Houston at 9:30 p.m. ET, the first of four meetings between the two teams and the second game of TNT\u2019s double-header. Pace : 97.8 (23rd) OffRtg : 110.5 (3rd) DefRtg : 106.4 (19th) NetRtg : +4.1 (5th) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders The Timberwolves have taken just 56 percent of their shots from the restricted area or 3-point range. THE CONTEXT  That\u2019s the second lowest rate in the league, higher than only that of the Sacramento Kings. The percentage of the league\u2019s shots that come from 3-point range continues to rise. It has gone from 22 percent in 2010-11 to almost 34 percent this season. The Wolves have ridden the wave somewhat. In coach Tom Thibodeau\u2019s first season, the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range increased to 25 percent from 20 percent in 2015-16. But it hasn\u2019t budged much this season, the fourth straight season in which the Wolves have ranked 29th or 30th in 3-point attempt percentage . Shots in the restricted area (1.26 points per attempt) are worth more than threes (1.09). League-wide, the percentage of shots that have come from the restricted area has stayed pretty steady (at around 32 percent) over the last 10 years. But the Wolves\u2019 percentage has dropped from 33 percent last season (the 10th highest rate in the league) to 29 percent this season (25th highest). Restricted area shots and 3-pointers are what most offenses are looking for and what most defenses are trying to prevent. And the Wolves are one of four teams that ranks in the bottom 10 both in the percentage of their shots that come from the restricted area and the percentage of their shots that come from beyond the arc. The other three teams \u2014 Sacramento, San Antonio and Washington \u2014 rank no better than 11th in offensive efficiency. But the Wolves rank third , having scored more than four points per 100 possessions more than the Wizards. * Additional note: The Knicks are the only team that has attempted more mid-range shots ( 1,028 ) than 3-pointers ( 972 ). The Wolves (995 vs. 1,039) are close. So how do they have such an efficient offense without taking a lot of efficient shots? First of all, they make the shots that they take. The Wolves rank fifth in field goal percentage , including third in field goal percentage in the restricted area and fourth in field goal percentage on other paint shots . Karl-Anthony Towns and Taj Gibson are two of the 10 players who have shot 70 percent or better on at least 200 shots in the restricted area , while Jimmy Butler leads the league in field goal percentage (53 percent) on other paint shots (minimum 100 attempts.) . The Wolves\u2019 lack of threes drops them from fifth in field goal percentage to 10th in effective field goal percentage , but that\u2019s still top 10. They\u2019re sort of the anti-Rockets (though not to the degree that the Knicks are). Because of all the 3-pointers they shoot, the Rockets rank 13th in field goal percentage and second in effective field goal percentage. Shooting is most important, but the Wolves\u2019 offense also ranks in the top 10 in free throw rate (sixth) , turnover percentage (third) , and offensive rebounding percentage (fifth) . In fact, they\u2019re the only team that ranks in the top 10 in each of the other three \u201cfour factors\u201d of efficiency. Interestingly, the Wolves don\u2019t have any individual who ranks in the top 48 in offensive rebounding percentage . But their three rotation bigs \u2013 Gorgui Dieng, Gibson and Towns \u2014 all rank between 49th and 58th, while Butler ranks in the top 10 among guards . Butler is also one of six players who has shot at least 85 percent on six or more free throw attempts per game . Tyus Jones, meanwhile, ranks sixth in assist-turnover ratio . The Wolves have committed 155 fewer turnovers (3.4 per game) than their opponents. They\u2019ve outscored their opponents by 4.5 points per game at the free throw line, and an additional 2.2 points per game on second chances . Though they haven\u2019t taken the best shots, they\u2019ve made up for it in the margins. 1. The Wolves\u2019 starting lineup has played 289 more minutes than any other lineup in the league . Health has been a factor. Jeff Teague has missed 11 games and Butler has missed two. But the other three starters have played all 46 games . Compare that to the LA Clippers\u2019 opening-night starting five, who have already missed 112 total games to injury. But Thibodeau also really likes his starting lineup. Not only have the Wolves\u2019 starters played in more games together (33) than any other lineup in the league, they\u2019ve also averaged 24.4 minutes together per game, 5.2 more than any other lineup . The lineup has been good. It has outscored its opponents by 8.7 points per 100 possessions in its 807 minutes, the 13th best mark among 27 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together . Of course, at the top of that list is the same group, except with Jones at point guard instead of Teague. That lineup has outscored its opponents by 28 points per 100 possessions in its 249 minutes, and it wasn\u2019t exactly picking on bad competition while Teague was out. Of the 11 games he missed, eight were against teams that are currently over .500 and in playoff position. Interestingly, though the starters are generally playing against the opponents\u2019 starters (and more talented players), it\u2019s been on defense where the Wolves have fallen off more when they\u2019ve gone to their bench. The two starting units (with either Teague or Jones at point guard) have allowed just 100 points per 100 possessions in their 1,055 minutes. That mark would rank second in the league defensively . All other Minnesota lineups have allowed 112 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would rank last. Andrew Wiggins and Towns lead the league in total minutes , but Butler leads the team with 36.8 minutes per game , and it\u2019s easy to understand why. He ranks fourth in the league in raw plus-minus and the Wolves have been 16.9 points per 100 possessions better with Butler on the floor (plus-8.8) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (minus-8.1). That is the league\u2019s second biggest on-off NetRtg differential among 285 players who have played at least 500 minutes this season. At the very bottom of that list is Jamal Crawford, with the Wolves having been 16.2 points per 100 possessions better with Crawford off the floor than with him on the floor. The Wolves have been outscored by 8.2 points per 100 possessions in 324 minutes with both Butler and Crawford on the floor (a combo they go to for about 7 1\/2 minutes per game), but are a plus-12.9 per 100 with Butler on the floor and Crawford on the bench . Crawford is still one of the nine guys that Thibodeau trusts with any minutes at all. When Nemanja Bjelica was ejected in the second quarter in Orlando on Tuesday, the Wolves just played one fewer guy in the second half, going back to the eight-man rotation that they had for much of Bjelica\u2019s 15-game absence earlier in the season . Shabazz Muhammad was in the rotation for the first month of the season, but has managed to register a minus-136 in just 264 minutes . The Wolves have allowed 123 points per 100 possessions with Muhammad on the floor, the worst mark among 331 players who have averaged at least 10 minutes per game in 20 or more games \u2026 by a really wide margin . 2. The Wolves have been the league\u2019s worst fourth-quarter team . . The Wolves have outscored their opponents by at least 6.8 points per 100 possessions in each of the other three quarters . But in the fourth, they\u2019re a minus-8.2. Their game in Orlando on Tuesday was the eighth time they\u2019ve lost a game that they led after the third quarter. They\u2019re still 26-8 in those situations, but the only other team with as many such losses is Dallas (12-8) . The Wolves have had problems on both ends of the floor in the fourth quarter. Their effective field goal percentage has been lowest and their turnover percentage has been highest in the fourth . But they rank last in fourth-quarter defense , having allowed 114 points per 100 possessions in the final 12 minutes of regulation. One issue may be that, with Thibodeau looking for shot creation on offense, Crawford ranks third on the team in fourth-quarter minutes . But the Wolves have still allowed 110 points per 100 possessions in the 207 fourth-quarter minutes that Butler has been on the floor without Crawford . Their opponent turnover percentage is lowest in the fourth quarter. Their opponent free throw rate is also highest in the fourth, but still ranks fourth in the league . What has really plagued the Wolves in the fourth quarter is how effectively their opponents have shot , both at the basket and from 3-point range. In the fourth quarter, the Wolves rank last in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (72 percent) and 26th in opponent 3-point percentage (37 percent) . In those two areas, their opponents have registered a little less than 1.3 points per attempt (like shooting 63 percent). Is fatigue a factor? One way to measure defensive activity is by steals and blocks. And the Wolves\u2019 four non-point-guard starters total just 0.19 steals plus blocks per minute played in the fourth quarter, down from 0.26 in the first, 0.23 in the second, and 0.23 in the third (with Wiggins and Butler seeing the biggest drop-offs). League-wide, those numbers are lowest in the fourth quarter, but don\u2019t see as dramatic a drop-off. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Harden, who is coming back from a strained left hamstring, stepped onto the court, nailed a couple of corner 3-pointers and got quickly into the flow of warmups. \u201cIt just feels good to be back out here around your teammates and that good energy and just hooping again,\u201d Harden said. \u201cTwo and a half weeks felt like a very long time.

I\u2019m crazy. Let\u2019s do it. After parting with GM David Griffin after the 2017 Finals , Cleveland\u2019s front office is playing from behind with its franchise savior, LeBron James. They need to go on the offensive to get back on side with the King. As he approaches free agency, the priority should be do everything to keep LeBron around, and that includes trading the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 2018 1st-round pick. The return is important, but keeping the NBA\u2019s greatest player content with the team\u2019s direction is even more significant. It\u2019s time to show him they\u2019ll do what will help him win now. It\u2019s not quite a Hail Mary,but it\u2019s a try down the field worth taking. It\u2019s a calculated risk. The Nets aren\u2019t bad. They currently have the 8th worst record in the NBA and their starting backcourt has been injured virtually all season with D\u2019Angelo Russell expected back soon. Brooklyn may not make the playoffs, but it is too scrappy and well-coached to fall to the NBA\u2019s basement. But can\u2019t Cleveland keep the Nets\u2019 pick and trade something else? Cleveland could trade its pick, which is currently in the mid-20s, sure, but anything of value the Cavs could trade from their roster that would warrant some return is too integral to their own playoff push. That\u2019s where GM Koby Altman comes in. He secured a heck of a package for Kyrie Irving last summer. He seems to have the power to turn a late first-rounder into a worthwhile piece, but I would be comfortable letting go of their higher selection if it meant getting a contributor (especially defensively.) The Cavs\u2019 window is now, even if it\u2019s in conjunction with the Warriors\u2019 run. And, I don\u2019t think pressure from the Cavs\u2019 locker room will force Altman to do anything, but he has no choice but to pay for the franchise\u2019s past transgressions. Even if they acquire something of value, could LeBron still leave? Oh, yeah. So, is it worth it? Even if the Cavs never win another championship, keeping James on the roster as long as they can is of enormous value. Best of luck to Altman, a man in a tough situation. * * *"},{"id":42269,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/week-history-lebron-james-becomes-youngest-20000-career-points","date":"2018-01-17","title":"Legendary Moments in NBA History: LeBron James youngest to score 20,000 career points","content":"LeBron James and Kobe Bryant were two of the standout players of their era, with their legacies, milestones and accomplishments debated and discussed often.

Such was the case on Jan. 16, 2013, when James reached the 20,000-career points mark in a Miami Heat road win against the Golden State Warriors . James eclipsed the milestone Wednesday night against the Golden State Warriors when he made a short jumper with 2:45 left in the second quarter to give him 2,001 career points. He needed 18 points entering the game to be the 38th NBA player to reach the mark.

I\u2019ve been surprised by the Celtics\u2019 resiliency in not just surviving but thriving after the Gordon Hayward injury, by Toronto\u2019s offensive overhaul, and by the Bulls\u2019 anti-tanking performances and solid play by the guys they got back in the Jimmy Butler trade. I\u2019m surprised Houston had such little trouble meshing All-Stars and that Oklahoma City did. I\u2019m surprised neither the Wizards nor the Bucks has demonstrated proper urgency for their ambitions. It surprises me that the Lakers have let this Big Baller nonsense fester so deep into the season, and that current players and referees think the tension between their groups is some sort of millennial problem, rather than the natural order that has ebbed and flowed across decades. But my No. 1 surprise based on 2017-18\u2019s first half is how quickly and effectively Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis shut up the wailers about the OKC-Indiana deal built around that other guy. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m surprised how well the Pacers and Bulls emerged \u2014 victorious, maybe? \u2014 from losing franchise players in offseason deals . Notice how you\u2019re not hearing anyone slam the Bulls for what they received for Jimmy Butler and especially the Pacers for their Paul George haul . All the noise is gone, now that both teams have good young (and cheaper) replacements that are already triggering a turnaround John Schuhmann : Honorable mention goes to the Pacers, who didn\u2019t look playoff team after trading Paul George. But the biggest surprise to me this season is that Tyreke Evans has been the Grizzlies\u2019 best player . Evans has put up good numbers on bad teams before, but this has been quite a comeback season for him after playing just 65 games over the last two years. With the highest usage rate of his career , he has scored much more efficiently than he ever has, and (as a guy who had an awful shooting form prior to this season) has been one of the league\u2019s best 3-point shooters off the dribble . He\u2019s been starting with Mike Conley out, but now looks like a guy that good teams will see as a very useful sixth man going forward. Sekou Smith :  The Boston Celtics sitting atop the Eastern Conference standings with a cushion is easily the biggest surprise for me.  It\u2019s not that I am shocked that Brad Steven has his team playing at a high level, that was a given. Doing it after losing Gordon Hayward jut five minutes and 15 seconds into the very first game of the season, is what is really shocking. I was prepared to remove the Celtics from my list of challengers. It made sense, in the moment. But not in the minutes, days and weeks since then. Stevens continues to push all the right buttons with players up and down the roster. Cleveland\u2019s issues and the fact that playoff fatigue might finally be starting to take a toll on LeBron James and his crew, makes me believe that the Celtics really could squash plans for Warrior-Cavaliers part IV in The Finals.

The image of Houston players trying to breach the Clippers\u2019 locker room, with a back hallway and an alleged diversionary tactic at the front door, is as hilarious as the \u201cInside the NBA\u201d TNT crew found it. It\u2019s a bad look for the teams involved \u2014 certainly the Rockets, but the Clippers earned their share of blame too \u2014 and not a great one for the league. Not on MLK Day, not with the president of the players association as a central figure. Then again, it\u2019s always nice to get a reminder of how competitive this league is, up to and including a little genuine dislike. I only wish, in this age of smartphones and drones, we had it all on video. Shaun Powell :  Well, we know there are deep-rooted feelings between the Clippers and Chris Paul, which really doesn\u2019t matter in the big picture. What\u2019s important is how good the Clippers will be when fully healthy, and how deep the Rockets will go into the post-season, and that game revealed no answers for either. Chris Paul has more at stake than his old teammates \u2014 can he, James Harden and Mike D\u2019Antoni finally win important games in May and June? Suppose they meet the Clippers in the first round and get bounced? John Schuhmann : I\u2019ll put the post-game shenanigans aside and note that the Clippers have won 11 of their last 14 games, beating the Warriors and Rockets (twice) in that stretch. They have a winning record and are just a half game out of a playoff spot , with their opening-night starters having missed a total of 109 games and guys on two-way contracts playing more than Danilo Gallinari. Lou Williams has kept their offense in the top 10 with Blake Griffin missing 16 games and having the worst shooting season of his career . They\u2019re getting good contributions from unheralded guys like Jawun Evans, Montrezl Harrell and Willie Reed, and it\u2019s a refreshing change in Clipperland. Sekou Smith :  From a distance, the on and off the court actions of the Rockets struck me as quite immature for a veteran group that should have its focus on another team from California (the Warriors). That they allowed the Clippers, Blake Griffin and Austin Rivers in particular, to get to them makes no sense. I get Chris Paul being caught up in the emotional trap of going back to Los Angeles to face his former team for the first time. It\u2019s an emotional experience, one you have to manage properly. I just expected CP3 and his new crew to handle the night much better than they did. A legitimate contender has to learn to rise above petty foolishness in those moments and continue to grind away, something the Paul-led Clippers struggled with routinely. I thought he left the foolishness behind when he moved on to Houston \u2026apparently not. And you better believe the other teams chasing the Rockets in the standings noticed, too.

I\u2019m not suggesting that there\u2019s a bigger gap between Golden State and Cleveland than there might be between the champs and a different Eastern Conference contender. But we keep seeing the Cavs falling short and, frankly, their repeated regular-season drama \u2013 a by-product of a veteran team \u201cnavigating\u201d rather than seizing the first 82 games \u2014 has grown stale. Look, it could be I\u2019d like to see two new Finals participants just for something fresh \u2014 this is uncharted territory for the NBA \u2014 but there\u2019s an inevitability about Golden State. Maybe the Raptors, the Celtics, the Wizards or another East team would get smacked down as unworthy substitutes. But maybe they wouldn\u2019t. Shaun Powell :  The Warriors are who we thought they were; the Cavs, not so much. Isaiah Thomas isn\u2019t quite comfortable with his body or his teammates yet and Cleveland\u2019s defense still reeks. In time, these issues can be improved to some degree, enough to confirm that nobody in the East is beating Cleveland four times in a playoff series, not with LeBron James (I\u2019ll believe it when I see it). But that\u2019s probably Cleveland\u2019s ceiling unless the Cavs make a move at the trade deadline, and even then there will be questions about the acclimation of a new player, too. John Schuhmann : I didn\u2019t have a strong takeaway from that single game, but have taken note that the Cavs rank 24th offensively since their Christmas loss in Oakland . We know that they\u2019ve been a terrible defensive team save a nine-game stretch in mid-November, but they\u2019ve been able to get by with an elite offense that makes up for their defensive mistakes. Isaiah Thomas obviously needs some time to get back to being himself, but offensive struggles like this indicate that there\u2019s more to worry about than just the usual bad habits and bad personnel on the other end of the floor. Of course, the last time the Cavs had a worse 10-game stretch offensively was right around this time last year. So I\u2019ll remind myself to never put too much emphasis on the regular-season struggles of a LeBron James team. Sekou Smith :  The biggest takeaway from yet another Warriors-Cavaliers matchup is just how large the gap is between the two teams. This started in The Finals last June and has continued to progress through the completion of these two regular season matchups. Right now, the Cavaliers don\u2019t match up nearly as well against the Warriors as it seemed they would. The Warriors have continued to fortify their roster, first with Kevin Durant and then with additions like rookie Jordan Bell and veteran Nick Young. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers\u2019 roster changes have not produced the immediate dividends in the wake of Kyrie Irving\u2019s departure. Granted, Isaiah Thomas is just getting started in his comeback. And Dwyane Wade has shown that he still has plenty left in his tank. But the Cavaliers are struggling under the weight of expectations that the Warriors using to fuel their fire, their chemistry is in question and perhaps Kyrie was far more critical to the operation than we realized.
